         <title>Mn&#8208;Rich MnSb2Te4: A Topological Insulator with Magnetic Gap Closing at High Curie Temperatures of 45&#8211;50 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;rich MnSb2Te4 is shown to exhibit ferromagnetic hysteresis with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy and Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K. It is a topological insulator with Dirac point close to the Fermi level and a magnetic gap that closes at the Curie temperature. These favorable properties are caused by excess Mn that substitutes Sb within the septuple layers.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic topological insulators exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect, which is potentially useful for high&#8208;precision metrology, edge channel spintronics, and topological qubits. &#160;The stable 2+ state of Mn enables intrinsic magnetic topological insulators. MnBi2Te4 is, however, antiferromagnetic with 25 K N&#233;el temperature and is strongly n&#8208;doped. In this work, p&#8208;type MnSb2Te4, previously considered topologically trivial, is shown to be a ferromagnetic topological insulator for a few percent Mn excess. i) Ferromagnetic hysteresis with record Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K, ii) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, iii) a 2D Dirac cone with the Dirac point close to the Fermi level, iv) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy, and v) a magnetically induced bandgap closing at the Curie temperature, demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), are shown. Moreover, a critical exponent of the magnetization &#946;&#160;&#8776; 1 is found, indicating the vicinity of a quantum critical point. Ab initio calculations reveal that Mn&#8211;Sb site exchange provides the ferromagnetic interlayer coupling and the slight excess of Mn nearly doubles the Curie temperature. Remaining deviations from the ferromagnetic order open the inverted bulk bandgap and render MnSb2Te4 a robust topological insulator and new benchmark for magnetic topological insulators.

         <title>Force&#8208;Based Wetting Characterization of Stochastic Superhydrophobic Coatings at Nanonewton Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning droplet adhesion microscopy and micropipette&#8208;based droplet friction measurements are used for quantitative evaluation of the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings. These novel force&#8208;based characterization techniques provide a detailed picture of the wetting performance and heterogeneity of super&#8208;repellent surfaces, far beyond what is afforded by traditional contact angle measurements.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic coatings have extraordinary properties like self&#8208;cleaning and staying dry, and have recently appeared on industrial and consumer markets. The stochastic nature of the coating components and coating processes (e.g., spraying, painting) affects the uniformity of the water repellency across the coated substrate. The wetting properties of those coatings are typically quantified on macroscale using contact angle goniometry (CAG). Here, highly sensitive force&#8208;based methods, scanning droplet adhesion microscopy (SDAM), and micropipette force sensor (MFS), are used, to quantify the microscale heterogeneity in the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings with irregular surface topography that cannot be investigated by CAG. By mapping the wetting adhesion forces with SDAM and friction forces with MFS, it is demonstrated that even the best coatings on the market are prone to heterogeneities that induce stick&#8211;slip motion of droplets. Thus, owing to their high spatial and force resolution, the advantages of these techniques over CAG are demonstrated.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionally Graded Composite Assembled Using Cellulose Nanocrystals and Genetically Engineered Proteins with Controlled Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formulation of a graded multiphase nanocomposite that mimics key molecular and architectural features of the mantis shrimp dactyl club in the complex shape of dental implant crown, exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and toughness, is reported. The material consists of expanded helicoidaly organized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins regulating both binding to CNCs and the growth of reinforcing apatite crystals.








Abstract
Nature provides unique insights into design strategies evolved by living organisms to construct robust materials with a combination of mechanical properties that are challenging to replicate synthetically. Hereby, inspired by the impact&#8208;resistant dactyl club of the stomatopod, a mineralized biocomposite is rationally designed and produced in the complex shapes of dental implant crowns exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and fracture toughness. This material consists of an expanded helicoidal organization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins that regulate both binding to CNCs and in situ growth of reinforcing apatite crystals. Critically, the structural properties emerge from controlled self&#8208;assembly across multiple length scales regulated by rational engineering and phase separation of the protein components. This work replicates multiscale biomanufacturing of a model biological material and also offers an innovative platform to synthesize multifunctional biocomposites whose properties can be finely regulated by colloidal self&#8208;assembly and engineering of its constitutive protein building blocks.

         <title>Programmable Multistable Perforated Shellular</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multidirectional multistable shellular metamaterials are developed by adding perforations on the Schwarz Primitive surface, where introducing elliptical holes can lead to the motif's structural bistability, while n&#8208;layer staggered perforations contribute to a maximum of 2n&#8722;1 stable states. Independent three&#8208;directional multistable perforated shellulars are demonstrated using transformations of a staggered perforated motif along the three orthogonal coordinate directions.








Abstract
Developing bistable metamaterials has recently offered a new design paradigm for deployable structures and reusable dampers. While most bistable mechanisms possess inclined/curved struts, a new 3D multistable shellular metamaterial is developed by introducing delicate perforations on the surface of Schwarz's Primitive shellular, integrating the unique properties of shellular materials such as high surface area, stiffness, and energy absorption with the multistability concept. Denoting the fundamental snapping part by motif, certain shellular motifs with elliptical perforations exhibit mechanical bistability. To bring the concept of multistability to a single motif, multistable shellular motifs are developed by introducing multilayer staggered perforations that form hinges and facilitate local instability. Adopting an n&#8208;layer staggered perforation (n hinges) design leads to a maximum 2n&#8722;1 stable states within one shellular motif during loading and unloading. Three&#8208;directional multistable shellulars are attained by extending the perforation design in three orthogonal directions. Harnessing snap&#8208;through and snap&#8208;back behaviors and self&#8208;contact, the introduced multistable perforated shellulars exhibit strong rigidity both in loading and unloading, and enhanced energy dissipation. The introduced design strategy opens up new horizons for creating multidirectional multistable metamaterials with load bearing capabilities for applications in soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing architectures, and reusable and deployable energy absorbers/dampers.

         <title>Ultrathin PdAuBiTe Nanosheets as High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Catalysts for a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin quaternary PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D&#160;nanosheets are first achieved by a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template strategy. As high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, the PdAuBiTe nanosheets can greatly increase power densities and durability in direct methanol fuel cell devices. The maximum power densities of PdAuBiTe nanosheets are up to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8211;2 in O2/air, respectively.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D metal nanostructures have sparked a lot of research interest because of their improved electrocatalytic properties for fuel cells. So far, no effective technique for preparing ultrathin 2D Pd&#8208;based metal nanostructures with more than three compositions has been published. Herein, a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template technique for producing PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D ultrathin nanosheets is developed. The mass activity of the PdAuBiTe nanosheets against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 2.48 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.5/17.7 times that of industrial Pd/C/Pt/C, respectively. After 10&#160;000 potential cyclings, there is no decrease in ORR activity. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets exhibit high methanol tolerance and in situ anti&#8208;CO poisoning properties. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets, as cathode electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells, can thus give significant improvement in terms of power density and durability. In O2/air, the power density can be increased to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, higher than that reported in previous work, and which is 2.32/3.59 times higher than Pt/C.

     alt="Ultrathin PdAuBiTe Nanosheets as High-Performance Oxygen Reduction Catalysts for a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Device"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin quaternary PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D&#160;nanosheets are first achieved by a new visible-light-induced template strategy. As high-performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, the PdAuBiTe nanosheets can greatly increase power densities and durability in direct methanol fuel cell devices. The maximum power densities of PdAuBiTe nanosheets are up to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air, respectively.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin 2D metal nanostructures have sparked a lot of research interest because of their improved electrocatalytic properties for fuel cells. So far, no effective technique for preparing ultrathin 2D Pd-based metal nanostructures with more than three compositions has been published. Herein, a new visible-light-induced template technique for producing PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D ultrathin nanosheets is developed. The mass activity of the PdAuBiTe nanosheets against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 2.48 A mg&lt;sub&gt;Pd&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is 27.5/17.7 times that of industrial Pd/C/Pt/C, respectively. After 10&#160;000 potential cyclings, there is no decrease in ORR activity. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets exhibit high methanol tolerance and in situ anti-CO poisoning properties. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets, as cathode electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells, can thus give significant improvement in terms of power density and durability. In O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/air, the power density can be increased to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, higher than that reported in previous work, and which is 2.32/3.59 times higher than Pt/C.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Constructing Graphitic&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Bonded Pentagons in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Graphene Matrix toward Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 m HClO4 is reported, with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials with high electrocatalytic activity are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in several renewable energy systems. However, the performance of carbon&#8208;based materials is far inferior to that of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in acid electrolytes. Here, a novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst is reported toward ORR in 0.1 m HClO4 with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability (100 h reaction time)&#160;than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of the carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy characterizations confirm the formation of GN&#8208;bonded pentagons in this carbon material. Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the activity is linearly associated with the amounts of both pentagons and adjacent GN atoms. Density function theory further demonstrates that adjacent GN atoms significantly increase the charge density at the carbon atom of a GN&#8208;bonded pentagon, which is the activity origin for the ORR.

         <title>Ambulatory Cardiovascular Monitoring Via a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Textile Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A waterproof textile&#8208;based wearable cardiovascular monitoring system is developed via a systematical integration of a triboelectric sensor, a signal processing circuit, a Bluetooth module, and a customized user&#8208;friendly APP interface. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, this system can perform continuous blood pressure monitoring against body motion and perspiration.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics for continuous and reliable pulse wave monitoring against body motion and perspiration remains a great challenge and highly desired. Here, a low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high&#8208;fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 &#181;A kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built&#8208;in algorithm is developed for one&#8208;click health data sharing and data&#8208;driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing new donor/acceptor materials and combining a ternary blending strategy, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is achieved. It is demonstrated that finely tuning the light utilization and photophysical processes of the active layer has great potential for further improving the PCEs of OPV cells.








Abstract
Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) is important for broadening the applications of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single&#8208;junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor named PBQx&#8208;TF and a new low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9&#8208;2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F&#8208;BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high&#8208;performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.

         <title>Quantum Oscillations in Ferromagnetic (Sb, V)2Te3 Topological Insulator Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of electric transport in Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 films demonstrates the coexistence of topological surface states and long&#8208;range ferromagnetism evidenced by Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations. Vanadium doping acts as an efficient tuning parameter for the Fermi surface size. This opens up a new route for the investigation of the crossover between different topological states based on this material class.








Abstract
An effective way of manipulating 2D surface states in magnetic topological insulators may open a new route for quantum technologies based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The doping&#8208;dependent evolution of the electronic band structure in the topological insulator Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.102) thin films is studied by means of electrical transport. Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films were&#160;prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, and Shubnikov&#8211;de Hass (SdH) oscillations are observed in both the longitudinal and transverse transport channels. Doping with the 3d element, vanadium, induces long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order with enhanced SdH oscillation amplitudes. The doping effect is systematically studied in various films depending on thickness and bottom gate voltage. The angle&#8208;dependence of the SdH oscillations reveals their 2D nature, linking them to topological surface states as their origin. Furthermore, it is shown that vanadium doping can efficiently modify the band structure. The tunability by doping and the coexistence of the surface states with ferromagnetism render Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films a promising platform for energy band engineering. In this way, topological quantum states may be manipulated to crossover from quantum Hall effect to quantum anomalous Hall effect, which opens an alternative route for the design of quantum electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn Pair Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic effect induced by electronic interactions is observed on novel atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn pair sites with superior activity and outstanding selectivity for CO2 electroreduction; better yet, the origin of this synergistic effect is revealed, both in the thermodynamic pathway and kinetic pathway.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts have the potential to outperform the well&#8208;established single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2. However, the lack of understanding regarding the mechanism of this enhanced catalytic process prevents the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Herein, an obvious synergistic effect in atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn bimetal sites is observed. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that heteronuclear coordination modifies the d&#8208;states of the metal atom, narrowing the gap between the d&#8208;band centre (&#949;d) of the Ni (3d) orbitals and the Fermi energy level (EF) to strengthen the electronic interaction at the reaction interface, resulting in a lower free energy barrier (&#916;G) in the thermodynamic pathway and a reduced activation energy (Ea) as well as fortified metal&#8211;C bonding in the kinetic pathway. Consequently, a CO faradaic efficiency of &gt;90% is obtained across a broad potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V (vs RHE), reaching a maximum of 99% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V, superior to that of the Ni/Zn single&#8208;metal sites.

         <title>2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Visible Black but Infrared White Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultralow infrared emissivity of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm this discovery and reveal other MXenes such as Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx are also low&#8208;emissivity materials. Such intrinsically visible black but infrared white materials that are rare in nature show great potential in solar&#8211;thermal conversion, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Black inorganic materials with low infrared absorption/emission (or IR white) are rare in nature but highly desired in numerous areas, such as solar&#8211;thermal energy harvesting, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic materials, such counter&#8208;intuitive properties are generally realized by constructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly nanofabrication techniques. Here, the intrinsically low mid&#8208;IR emissivity (down to 10%) of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to 90%), it embraces the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic black solar&#8208;absorbing materials. Its appealing potential in several of the aforementioned areas is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXene relies on both the nanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The calculations also suggest more potential low&#8208;emissivity MXenes including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx. This work opens the avenue to further exploration of a family of intrinsically low&#8208;emissivity materials with over 70 members.

         <title>Manipulating Electrocatalytic Li2S Redox via Selective Dual&#8208;Defect Engineering for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common MoSe2 electrocatalyst synergizing N&#8208;doping and Se&#8208;vacancy enables optimal Li2S electrocatalytic manipulation toward favorable bidirectional sulfur redox chemistry with high electrocatalytic selectivity, accordingly achieving excellent rate performance, cycling stability, and areal capacity in pursuit of working Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, yet they are plagued by the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics. While rationally designed redox mediators can facilitate polysulfide conversion, favorable bidirectional sulfur electrocatalysis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, selective dual&#8208;defect engineering (i.e., introducing both N&#8208;doping and Se&#8208;vacancies) of a common MoSe2 electrocatalyst is used to manipulate the bidirectional Li2S redox. Systematic theoretical prediction and detailed electrokinetic analysis reveal the selective electrocatalytic effect of the two types of defects, thereby achieving a deeper mechanistic understanding of the bidirectional sulfur electrochemistry. The Li&#8211;S battery using this electrocatalyst exhibits excellent cyclability, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. More impressively, the potential for practical applications is highlighted by a high areal capacity (7.3 mAh cm&#8722;2) and the construction of a flexible pouch cell. Such selective electrocatalysis created by dual&#8208;defect engineering is an appealing approach toward working Li&#8211;S systems.

         <title>Mo2N&#8211;W2N Heterostructures Embedded in Spherical Carbon Superstructure as Highly Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalysts for Stable Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo2N&#8211;W2N heterostructures embedded in spherical carbon superstructure (Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC) are designed as the S hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries. The Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC can efficiently suppress the polysulfide shuttling, promote the redox reactions, and catalyze the fast conversion of sodium polysulfides.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are highly desirable for a sustainable large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage system due to their high energy density and low cost. Nevertheless, practical applications of RT Na&#8211;S batteries are still prevented by the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), slow reaction kinetics of S, and incomplete conversion process of NaPS. Here, Mo2N&#8211;W2N heterostructures embedded in a spherical carbon superstructure (Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC) are designed to efficiently suppress the &#8220;polysulfide shuttle&#8221; and promote NaPS redox reactions. The designed Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces, high conductivity, and porosity can facilitate electron/ion diffusion and provide high catalytic activity for efficient NaPS conversion. The obtained Na&#8211;S battery delivers high reversible capacity with superior long&#8208;term cyclability (517 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles) and unprecedented rate capability (417 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the electrocatalysis mechanism is revealed by combining in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV&#8211;vis spectra, and precipitation experiments. This work demonstrates a novel heterostructure design strategy that enables high&#8208;performance Na&#8211;S batteries.

Chameleon&#8208;inspired prodrug nanovesicles are developed for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and second&#8208;near&#8208;IR fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided release of autophagy inhibitor doxycycline (Doxy) and bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 inhibitor JQ1. Prodrug nanovesicle&#8208;based treatment conquers both the intrinsic and inducible immune resistance by simultaneously augmenting antigen presentation with Doxy, and diminishing programmed death ligand 1 expression on the surface of the tumor cells with JQ1.








Abstract
Immune evasion is the major obstacle for T&#8208;cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. The insufficient expression of the tumor&#8208;rejection antigen causes the intrinsic immune resistance and high expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) induced by interferon gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;), which accounts for the inducible immune resistance. To deal with both the intrinsic and inducible immune resistance of cancer, a multifunctional prodrug nanovesicle is sequentially developed. It is first sorted out that doxycycline (Doxy) efficiently inhibits autophagy of the tumor cells, and increases the surface level of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I). Then, chameleon&#8208;inspired prodrug nanovesicles are engineered for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of Doxy. The prodrug nanovesicles integrating a sheddable poly(ethylene glycol) shell and CRGDK ligand are kept stable during blood circulation, while exposing the targeting ligand in the tumor, which significantly inhibits autophagy, elicits MHC&#8208;I expression, increases tumor antigen presentation, recruits more tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes, and suppresses FN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;induced intratumoral PD&#8208;L1 expression. After a proof of concept for overcoming intrinsic and inducible immune evasion, the prodrug nanovesicles are applied to validate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in two tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This research thus provides a novel targeting strategy for reducing tumor immune resistance and potentiating tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Dilute Aqueous&#8208;Aprotic Hybrid Electrolyte Enabling a Wide Electrochemical Window through Solvation Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dilute aqueous&#8208;aprotic hybrid electrolyte is developed with broad electrochemical window. The introduced aprotic solvent can regulate the solvation structures of the electrolyte and the water molecules are strongly confined around the Na cations. As a result, in such a hybrid electrolyte, the decomposition of water is suppressed and the electrochemical window of the water is broadened.








Abstract
The application of superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes has shown great potential in developing high&#8208;voltage electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLCs). However, the broadening of the electrochemical window of such superconcentrated electrolytes is at the expense of their high cost, low ionic conductivity, high density, and narrow operating temperature range. Herein, the electrochemical window of water (&gt;3&#160;V) at low salt concentration (3 m) is expanded by using an aprotic solvent, i.e., trimethyl phosphate (TMP), to regulate the solvation structure of the electrolyte. Benefiting from the low salt concentration, such electrolyte is simultaneously featured with high ionic conductivity, low density, and wide temperature compatibility. Based on the dilute hybrid electrolyte, EDLCs constructed by using porous graphene electrodes are able to operate within an enlarged voltage range of 0&#8211;2.4&#160;V at a wide range of temperatures from &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C. They also present excellent rate capability and cycle stability, i.e., 83% capacitance retention after 100&#160;000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations verify that TMP induces a significant electronic modulation for the bonding environment of the electrolyte. This enables the stronger binding of Na+&#8211;H2O with freely migrating TMP to expand the voltage window to exceed the potential limitation of aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

         <title>Vectorial Compound Metapixels for Arbitrary Nonorthogonal Polarization Steganography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vectorial compound metapixel design enables independent and linear modulations of the output beam in both amplitude and polarization rotations across the Malus metasurface. With this, arbitrary&#8208;angle steganography is demonstrated by both multiplexing two continuous grayscale images in arbitrary nonorthogonal polarization angles and concealing one grayscale image on another in an arbitrary disclosure angle window.








Abstract
Malus&#8217; law regulating the intensity of light when passed through a polarizer, forms the solid basis for image steganography based on orthogonal polarizations of light to convey hidden information without adverse perceptions, which underpins important practices in information encryptions, anti&#8208;counterfeitings, and security labels. Unfortunately, the restriction to orthogonal states being taken for granted in the common perceptions fails to advance cryptoinformation to upgraded levels of security. By introducing a vectorial compound metapixel design, arbitrary nonorthogonal polarization multiplexing of independent grayscale images with high fidelity and strong concealment is demonstrated. The Jones matrix treatment of compound metapixels consisting of double atoms with tailored in&#8208;plane orientation sum and difference allows point&#8208;by&#8208;point configuring of both the amplitude and polarization rotations of the output beam in an analytical and linear form. With this, both multiplexing two continuous grayscale images in arbitrary nonorthogonal polarization angles and concealing grayscale image on another in an arbitrary disclosure angle window are experimentally demonstrated in the visible TiO2 metasurface platform. The methods shed new light on multifarious metaoptics by harnessing the new degree of freedom and unlock the full potential of metasurface polarization optics.

         <title>A Soft Variable&#8208;Area Electrical&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Energy Harvester</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal encased in a hydrogel naturally forms an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor. Mechanical deformation of these soft and stretchable materials causes the interfacial area and thus capacitance to increase, which can drive current through an external circuit. This unique combination of materials allows the device to convert multiple modes of mechanical deformation into electricity both in air and underwater.








Abstract
The technological promise of soft devices&#8212;wearable electronics, implantables, soft robotics, sensors&#8212;has accelerated the demand for deformable energy sources. Devices that can convert mechanical energy to electrical energy can enable self&#8208;powered, tetherless, and sustainable devices. This work presents a completely soft and stretchable (&gt;400% strain) energy harvester based on variable&#8208;area electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) capacitors (&#8776;40&#160;&#181;F&#160;cm&#8722;2). Mechanically varying the EDL area, and thus the capacitance, disrupts equilibrium and generates a driving force for charge movement through an external circuit. Prior EDL capacitors varied the contact area by depressing water droplets between rigid electrodes. In contrast, here, the harvester consists of liquid&#8208;metal electrodes encased in a hydrogel. Deforming the device by &#8776;25% strain generates a power density &#8776;0.5&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2. This unconventional approach is attractive because: (1) it does not need an external voltage supply to provide charge; (2) the electrodes themselves deform; and (3) it can work under various modes of deformation such as pressing, stretching, bending, and twisting. The unique ability of the harvester to operate underwater shows promising applications in wearables that contact sweat, underwater sensing, and blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Carbon Nanotube&#8211;Hydrogel Composites Facilitate Neuronal Differentiation While Maintaining Homeostasis of Network Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, versatile method for the preparation of carbon nanotube&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel composites is developed. The effects of the composites on neuronal differentiation and activity of pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, adult neural stem cells, and primary hippocampal neurons are investigated. It is demonstrated that the composites can serve as effective scaffolds promoting neuronal differentiation while maintaining network activity homeostasis.








Abstract
It is often assumed that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stimulate neuronal differentiation by transferring electrical signals and enhancing neuronal excitability. Given this, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are regarded as potential materials able to combine high electrical conductivity with biocompatibility, and therefore promote nerve regeneration. However, whether CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites actually influence neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how they do so remain elusive. In this study, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are prepared by in situ polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) around a preformed CNT meshwork. It is demonstrated that the composites facilitate long&#8208;term survival and differentiation of pheochromocytoma 12 cells. Adult neural stem cells cultured on the composites show an increased neuron&#8208;to&#8208;astrocyte ratio and higher synaptic connectivity. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons cultured on composites maintain morphological synaptic features as well as their neuronal network activity evaluated by spontaneous calcium oscillations, which are comparable to neurons cultured under control conditions. These results indicate that the composites are promising materials that could indeed facilitate neuronal differentiation while maintaining neuronal homeostasis.

         <title>Designing New&#8208;Generation Piezoelectric Transducers by Embedding Superior Graphene&#8208;Based Thermal Regulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels are constructed via synthesizing a brand&#8208;new chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived 3D/2D graphene homojunction on an AlN&#8208;thermosensitive&#8208;ceramic template. New&#8208;generation cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers are designed and constructed via embedding the 3D/2D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based thermal regulators, which can simultaneously uniformize, transmit, and release heat. The self&#8208;heating&#8208;caused temperature rise is substantially reduced by &#8776;60%, along with dramatically enhanced electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and amplitude.








Abstract
Cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers (CPETs) is a key component in modern energy&#8208;conversion fields, possessing versatile applications in ultrasonic scalpels, acoustic levitation, and sonar. However, serious self&#8208;heating inevitably occurs inside high&#8208;power CPETs, severely limiting their practical applications in broader fields. To tackle this, multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels of multidimensional (multi&#8208;D, 3D/2D) graphene films are introduced in designing new&#8208;type thermal regulators. A porous AlN&#8208;ceramic thermal&#8208;sink is creatively selected as a template for directly synthesizing graphene via a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition strategy. This perfect combination of 3D/2D&#8208;graphene and the AlN ceramic can integrate their complementary advantages in uniformizing, transmitting, and releasing heat. Amazingly, in the new&#8208;generation CPETs embedded with these graphene&#8208;based thermal regulators, the self&#8208;heating&#8208;induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by &#8776;60% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new&#8208;generation CPETs. Briefly, this research realizes the first synthesis of a novel multi&#8208;D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic hybrid, and propels its brand&#8208;new application directions in new&#8208;generation energy&#8208;conversion&#8208; and thermal&#8208;management&#8208;related territories.

         <title>Enhanced Thermopower of Saturated Molecules by Noncovalent Anchor&#8208;Induced Electron Doping of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated molecules are not preferred in the research of organic thermoelectrics because of intrinsically wide bandgaps and poor thermopower. Graphene electrodes are demonstrated to be able to enhance thermopower of monolayers of saturated compounds. A noncovalent amine anchor induces the creation of in&#8208;gap states and n&#8208;type doping of graphene, thereby leading to an increased Seebeck coefficient relative to analogous covalent gold&#8211;thiolate monolayers.








Abstract
Enhancing thermopower is a key goal in organic and molecular thermoelectrics. Herein, it is shown that introducing noncovalent contact with a single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) electrode improves the thermopower of saturated molecules as compared to the traditional gold&#8211;thiolate covalent contact. Thermoelectric junction measurements with a liquid&#8208;metal technique reveal that the value of Seebeck coefficient in large&#8208;area junctions based on n&#8208;alkylamine self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on SLG is increased up to fivefold compared to the analogous junction based on n&#8208;alkanethiolate SAMs on gold. Experiments with Raman spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor analysis indicate that such enhancements benefit from the creation of new in&#8208;gap states and electron doping through noncovalent interaction between the amine anchor and the SLG electrode, which leads to a reduced energy offset between the Fermi level and the transport channel. This work demonstrates that control of interfacial bonding nature in molecular junctions improves the Seebeck effect in saturated molecules.

         <title>An Injectable Meta&#8208;Biomaterial: From Design and Simulation to In Vivo Shaping and Tissue induction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metamaterials gain unusual properties through their microstructure rather than specific chemistry. An elastic, porous, and injectable (EPI) microscaffold metamaterial is simulated and designed. The EPI provides experimental proof to the conjecture of elastic strain softening in microgel suspensions. Initially shapeable, it dynamically matches the local tissue mechanics, and templates long&#8208;term soft tissue colonization and vascularization.








Abstract
A novel type of injectable biomaterial with an elastic softening transition is described. The material enables in&#160;vivo shaping, followed by induction of 3D stable vascularized tissue. The synthesis of the injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial is instructed by extensive numerical simulation as a suspension of irregularly fragmented, highly porous sponge&#8208;like microgels. The irregular particle shape dramatically enhances yield strain for in&#160;vivo stability against deformation. Porosity of the particles, along with friction between internal surfaces, provides the elastic softening transition. This emergent metamaterial property enables the material to reversibly change stiffness during deformation, allowing native tissue properties to be matched over a wide range of deformation amplitudes. After subcutaneous injection in mice, predetermined shapes can be sculpted manually. The 3D shape is maintained during excellent host tissue integration, with induction of vascular connective tissue that persists to the end of one&#8208;year follow&#8208;up. The geometrical design is compatible with many hydrogel materials, including cell&#8208;adhesion motives for cell transplantation. The injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial therefore provides new perspectives in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Video Speed Switching of Plasmonic Structural Colors with High Contrast and Superior Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic paper technologies are essential for reducing the energy consumption in future display devices. The first example of video speed switching of structural colors over the whole visible region is shown, while retaining high contrast. This is achieved with polarization&#8208;insensitive metasurfaces and conjugated polymers, not liquid crystals. The lifetime is shown to be over ten million cycles.








Abstract
Reflective displays or &#8220;electronic paper&#8221; technologies provide a solution to the high energy consumption of emissive displays by simply utilizing ambient light. However, it has proven challenging to develop electronic paper with competitive image quality and video speed capabilities. Here, the first technology that provides video speed switching of structural colors with high contrast over the whole visible is shown. Importantly, this is achieved with a&#160;broadband&#8208;absorbing polarization&#8208;insensitive electrochromic polymer instead of liquid crystals, which makes it possible to maintain high reflectivity. It is shown that promoting electrophoretic ion transport (drift motion) improves the switch speed. In combination with new nanostructures that have high surface curvature, this enables video speed switching (20&#160;ms) at high contrast (50% reflectivity change). A detailed analysis of the optical signal during switching shows that the polaron formation starts to obey first order reaction kinetics in the video speed regime. Additionally, the system still operates at ultralow power consumption during video speed switching (&lt;1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and has negligible power consumption (&lt;1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) in bistability mode. Finally, the fast switching increases device lifetime to at least 107 cycles, an order of magnitude more than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

Additionally, the system still operates at ultralow power consumption during video speed switching (&amp;lt;1&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and has negligible power consumption (&amp;lt;1 &#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in bistability mode. Finally, the fast switching increases device lifetime to at least 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; cycles, an order of magnitude more than state-of-the-art.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Quantum Confinement in CVD 2D WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatically defined quantum confinement in large&#8208;area chemical vapor deposition&#8208;grown 2D WS2 with HfO2 dielectrics grown by atomic layer deposition is reported. This marks a key milestone in scalable approaches toward 2D&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based quantum devices, which has hitherto only been demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;sized exfoliated flakes. The measurements show that low&#8208;temperature carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but is due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness.








Abstract
Temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements are&#160;performed on the same set of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown WS2 single&#8208; and bilayer devices before and after atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2. This isolates the influence of HfO2 deposition on low&#8208;temperature carrier transport and shows that carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness. This finding is corroborated by circular dichroic photoluminescence spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy, cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, carrier&#8208;transport modeling, and density functional modeling. Finally, electrostatic gate&#8208;defined quantum confinement is demonstrated using a scalable approach of large&#8208;area CVD&#8208;grown bilayer WS2 and ALD&#8208;grown HfO2. The high dielectric constant and low leakage current enabled by HfO2 allows an estimated quantum dot size as small as 58 nm. The ability to lithographically define increasingly smaller devices is especially important for transition metal dichalcogenides due to their large effective masses, and should pave the way toward their use in quantum information processing applications.

         <title>High Antibacterial Activity and Selectivity of the Versatile Polysulfoniums that Combat Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of polypeptoid sulfoniums prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization functionalization exhibit high selectivity and potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacy with negligible antibacterial resistance. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms.








Abstract
Sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;containing polymers exhibit significant potential benefits for various applications. An efficient strategy to synthesize a type of antibacterial sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing polypeptoids via a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerization and a post&#8208;polymerization functionalization with various functional epoxides is presented. A systematic investigation is further performed in order to explore the influence of the overall hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity and selectivity of the prepared polysulfoniums. Notably, those chlorepoxypropane&#8208;modified polysulfoniums with an optimized amphiphilic balance show higher selectivity toward both Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus, than to red blood cells. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting S. aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms. Remarkably, negligible antibacterial resistance and cross&#8208;resistance to commercial antibiotics is shown in these polymers. The polysulfoniums further show their potent in vivo antimicrobial efficacy in a multidrug&#8208;resistant S. aureus infection model that is developed on mouse skin. Similar to the antimicrobial peptides, the polysulfoniums are demonstrated to kill bacteria through membrane disruption. The obtained polypeptoid sulfoniums, with high selectivity and potent antibacterial property, are excellent candidates for antibacterial treatment and open up new possibilities for the preparation of a class of innovative antimicrobials.

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation of the Green Mussel Adhesive Protein Pvfp&#8208;5 is Regulated by the Post&#8208;Translated Dopa Amino Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underwater adhesive prowess of mussels is well&#8208;known to be linked to the post&#8208;translated amino acid l&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) present in high abundance in mussel adhesive proteins. Dopa is shown to play another important role in green mussel adhesive threads: it regulates liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of the adhesive protein Pvfp&#8208;5, enabling biofabrication of the adhesive thread under an immersed environment.








Abstract
The underwater adhesive prowess of aquatic mussels has been largely attributed to the abundant post&#8208;translationally modified amino acid l&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) in mussel foot proteins (MFPs) that make up their adhesive threads. More recently, it has been suggested that during thread fabrication, MFPs form intermediate fluidic phases such as liquid crystals or coacervates regulated by a liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) process. Here, it is shown that Dopa plays another central role during mussel fiber formation, by enabling LLPS of Pvfp&#8208;5&#946;, a main MFP of the green mussel Perna viridis. Using residue&#8208;specific substitution of Tyrosine (Tyr) for Dopa during recombinant expression, Dopa&#8208;substituted Pvfp&#8208;5&#946; is shown to exhibit LLPS under seawater&#8208;like conditions, whereas the Tyr&#8208;only version forms insoluble aggregates. Combining quantum chemistry calculations and solution NMR, a transient H&#8208;bonding network requiring the two hydroxyl groups of Dopa is found to be critical to enable LLPS in Dopa&#8208;mutated Pvfp&#8208;5&#946;. Overall, the study suggests that Dopa plays an important role in regulating LLPS of MFPs, which may be critical to concentrate the adhesive proteins at the plaque/substrate interface and therefore produce a more robust adhesive. The findings also provide molecular&#8208;level lessons to guide biomanufacturing of protein&#8208;based materials such as bioadhesives and load&#8208;bearing fibers.

         <title>A Pyrite Iron Disulfide Cathode with a Copper Current Collector for High&#8208;Energy Reversible Magnesium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective Mg&#8208;ion storage of apyrite FeS2 cathode is realized by introducing a redox couple of cuprous sulfide and copper, originating from the copper current collector. An impressive energy density of 714&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 dominated by a four&#8208;electron conversion reaction (Fe2+/Fe and S22&#8722;/S2&#8722;) and good cycling stability over 1000 cycles of the as&#8208;prepared FeS2 nanomaterial cathode are achieved.








Abstract
Owing to its low cost, high theoretical capacity, and environmentally friendly characteristics, pyrite FeS2 demonstrates promise as a cathode material for high&#8208;energy metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based rechargeable batteries. When it is used in a rechargeable magnesium battery (RMB), the electrode couple exhibits an extremely low theoretical volume change upon full discharge. However, its electrochemical Mg&#8208;ion storage is considerably hindered by slow reaction kinetics. In this study, a high&#8208;performance FeS2 cathode for RMBs using a copper current collector is reported, which is involved in cathode reactions via a reversible redox process between copper and cuprous sulfide. This phase transformation with the formation of copper nanowires during discharge activates the redox reactions of FeS2 via a two&#8208;step and four&#8208;electron Mg&#8208;ion transfer that dominates the cathode reactions. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FeS2 nanomaterial cathode delivers a significantly enhanced reversible capacity of 679 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1. The corresponding energy density of 714&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is superior to those of all previously reported metal chalcogenide cathodes in RMBs or hybrid batteries using a Mg metal anode. Notably, the as&#8208;assembled FeS2&#8211;Mg battery can operate over 1000 cycles with a good capacity retention at 400&#160;mA g&#8722;1.

         <title>Evolving Devil's Staircase Magnetization from Tunable Charge Density Waves in Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fractionally quantized Hall plateaus originate from translational symmetry breaking in 2D systems. It is also possible to observe similar quantization of other physical properties in bulk materials in the presence of coupled collective excitations. Such a state is realized and tuned by changing the electron count in CeSbTe. It also creates an idealized nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal state in this compound.








Abstract
While several magnetic topological semimetals have been discovered in recent years, their band structures are far from ideal, often obscured by trivial bands at the Fermi energy. Square&#8208;net materials with clean, linearly dispersing bands show potential to circumvent this issue. CeSbTe, a square&#8208;net material, features multiple magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;controllable topological phases. Here, it is shown that in this material, even higher degrees of tunability can be achieved by changing the electron count at the square&#8208;net motif. Increased electron filling results in structural distortion and formation of charge density waves (CDWs). The modulation wave&#8208;vector evolves continuously leading to a region of multiple discrete CDWs and a corresponding complex &#8220;Devil's staircase&#8221; magnetic ground state. A series of fractionally quantized magnetization plateaus is observed, which implies direct coupling between CDW and a collective spin&#8208;excitation. It is further shown that the CDW creates a robust idealized nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal, thus providing access to topological systems with rich&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Exceptionally Robust Face&#8208;Sharing Motifs Enable Efficient and Durable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D 5H&#8208;polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; oxide with high&#8208;valence face&#8208;sharing motifs is developed as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction. This exceptional face&#8208;sharing structure can be maintained even under high anodic potentials and accelerates the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H2O&#160;+&#160;e&#8722;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice&#8208;oxygen participation.








Abstract
Corner&#8208;sharing oxides usually suffer from structural reconstruction during the bottleneck oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. Therefore, introducing dynamically stable active sites in an alternative structure is urgent but challenging. Here, 1D 5H&#8208;polytype Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; oxide with face&#8208;sharing motifs is identified as a highly active and stable candidate for alkaline OER. Benefiting from the stable face&#8208;sharing motifs with three couples of combined bonds, Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; can maintain its local structures even under high OER potentials as evidenced by fast operando spectroscopy, contributing to a negligible performance degradation over 110&#160;h. Besides, the higher Co valence and smaller orbital bandgap in Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; endow it with a much better electron transport ability than its corner&#8208;sharing counterpart, leading to a distinctly reduced overpotential of 308&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.1&#160;m KOH. Further mechanism studies show that the short distance between lattice&#8208;oxygen sites in face&#8208;sharing Ba5Bi0.25Co3.75FeO14&#8722;&#948; can accelerate the deprotonation step (*OOH&#160;+&#160;OH&#8722;&#160;=&#160;*OO&#160;+&#160;H2O&#160;+&#160;e&#8722;) via a steric inductive effect to promote lattice&#8208;oxygen participation. In this work, not only is a new 1D face&#8208;sharing oxide with impressive OER performance discovered, but also a rational design of dynamic stable and active sites for sustainable energy systems is inaugurated.

         <title>Selective Thrombosis of Tumor for Enhanced Hypoxia&#8208;Activated Prodrug Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional nanoplatform is developed by encapsulating coagulation&#8208;inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor&#8208;homing ligand, which can selectively activate platelet aggregation at a tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia level to enhance the prodrug therapy.








Abstract
One of the main challenges for tumor vascular infarction in combating cancer lies in failing to produce sustained complete thrombosis. Inspired by the capability of vascular infarction in blocking the delivery of oxygen to aggravate tumor hypoxia, the performance of selective tumor thrombus inducing hypoxia activation therapy to improve the therapeutic index of coagulation&#8208;based tumor therapy is presented. By encapsulating coagulation&#8208;inducing protease thrombin and a hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrug (HAP) tirapazamine into metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles with a tumor&#8208;homing ligand, the obtained nanoplatform selectively activates platelet aggregation at the tumor to induce thrombosis and vascular obstruction therapy by the exposed thrombin. Meanwhile, the thrombus can cut off the blood oxygen supply and potentiate the hypoxia levels to enhance the HAP therapy. This strategy not only addresses the dissatisfaction of vascular therapy, but also conquers the dilemma of inadequate hypoxia in HAP treatment. Since clinical operations such as surgery can be used to induce coagulation, coagulation&#8208;based synergistic therapy is promising for translation into a clinical combination regimen.

         <title>Optoelectronic Properties of Low&#8208;Bandgap Halide Perovskites for Solar Cell Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;bandgap tin&#8208;containing halide perovskites have recently demonstrated impressive photovoltaic performances owing to their unique optoelectronic properties, which are yet to be fully explored. A perspective on the absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport phenomena in these materials is provided, underscoring an interesting interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that needs to be controlled for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Riding on the coat tails of rapid developments in single&#8208;junction halide perovskite solar cells, all&#8208;perovskite multijunction solar cells have recently garnered significant attention, with the highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency already reaching 25.6%. Much of this progress has been fueled by the rapid rise in the photovoltaic performance of low&#8208;bandgap halide perovskite absorbers, materials, which, to date, have only been achievable by the partial or complete substitution of lead with tin. However, much room still exists to develop a more critical understanding of key material properties in these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites. Herein, the key optoelectronic properties of absorption, carrier generation, recombination, and transport in these tin&#8208;containing perovskites are discussed, showing that intrinsic doping distinctively impacts many of these properties, thereby rendering this class of halide perovskites unique within the family. Current understanding of the mechanisms that degrade optoelectronic performance in these materials and the corresponding devices are also summarized. These collective results highlight an important interplay between doping, defects, and degradation that will need to be controlled. Finally, the current gaps in understanding of these low&#8208;bandgap perovskites are outlined, thereby providing guidelines for further research, which will unlock their full potential for realizing a plethora of high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Monte Carlo Simulations Reveal New Design Principles for Efficient Nanoradiosensitizers Based on Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study reveals nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) as superior radiosensitizers over non&#8208;porous nanoparticles. The porous lattice model shows improved radiosensitization regardless of radiation source and lattice size. An optimal dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning the geometry of the lattice, providing the theoretical basis for the design of nMOFs for radiotherapy.








Abstract
Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have recently been shown to provide better radiosensitization than solid nanoparticles (NPs) when excited with X&#8208;rays. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation of different radiosensitization effects by NPs and nMOFs using a lattice model consisting of 3D arrays of nanoscale secondary building units (SBUs) is reported. The simulation results reveal that lattices outperform solid NPs regardless of radiation sources or particle sizes via enhanced scatterings of photons and electrons within the lattices. Optimum dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning SBU size and inter&#8208;SBU distance.

An optimal dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning the geometry of the lattice, providing the theoretical basis for the design of nMOFs for radiotherapy.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nMOFs) have recently been shown to provide better radiosensitization than solid nanoparticles (NPs) when excited with X-rays. Here, a Monte Carlo simulation of different radiosensitization effects by NPs and nMOFs using a lattice model consisting of 3D arrays of nanoscale secondary building units (SBUs) is reported. The simulation results reveal that lattices outperform solid NPs regardless of radiation sources or particle sizes via enhanced scatterings of photons and electrons within the lattices. Optimum dose enhancement can be achieved by tuning SBU size and inter-SBU distance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Smoothing the Sodium&#8208;Metal Anode with a Self&#8208;Regulating Alloy Interface for High&#8208;Energy and Sustainable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;regulating alloy interface, which contains chemically sodiophilic yet electron&#8208;hindered semiconducting Na3Sb nanoislands and the sodiophobic yet electron&#8208;favored conductive Ni matrix, is reported. Benefiting from the unique self&#8208;regulating mechanism and textile&#8208;structured current collector, full cells paired with high&#8208;capacity cathode deliver a ultrahigh energy density exceeding 200&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 with ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.








Abstract
Because of the large abundance of sodium (Na) as a source material and the easy fabrication of Na&#8208;containing compounds, the sodium (Na) battery is a more environmentally friendly and sustainable technology than the lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB). Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) are considered promising to realize a high energy density to overtake the cost effectiveness of LIBs, which is critically important in large&#8208;scale applications such as grid energy storage. However, the cycling stability of the Na&#8208;metal anode faces significant challenges particularly under high cycling capacities, due to the complex failure models caused by the formation of Na dendrites. Here, a universal surface strategy, based on a self&#8208;regulating alloy interface of the current collector, to inhibit the formation of Na dendrites is reported. High&#8208;capacity (10 mAh cm&#8722;2) Na&#8208;metal anodes can achieve stable cycling for over 1000 h with a low overpotential of 35&#160;mV. When paired with a high&#8208;capacity Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode (7 mAh cm&#8722;2), the SMB delivers an unprecedented energy density (calculated based on all the cell components) over 200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with flooded electrolyte, or over 230&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with lean electrolyte. The dendrite&#8208;free SMB also shows high cycling stability with a capacity retention per cycle over 99.9% and an ultrahigh energy efficiency of 95.8%.

         <title>Pathologically Responsive Mitochondrial Gene Therapy in an Allotopic Expression&#8208;Independent Manner Cures Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathologically responsive mitochondrial gene therapy referred to as &#8220;TISUH&#8221; in an allotopic expression&#8208;independent manner achieves accurately in situ mitochondrial gene delivery. It is a novel nanomedicine harnessing pathological characteristics to import exogenous gene into mitochondria for Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy treatment, a capability that has potential to model mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutated disorders and correct genetic abnormalities in other mtDNA mutated diseases.








Abstract
Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare inherited blindness caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The disorder is untreatable and tricky, as the existing chemotherapeutic agent Idebenone alleviates symptoms rather than overcoming the underlying cause. Although some studies have made progress on allotopic expression for LHON, in situ mitochondrial gene therapy remains challenging, which may simplify delivery procedures to be a promising therapeutic for LHON. LHON becomes more difficult to manage in the changed mitochondrial microenvironment, including increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Herein, a pathologically responsive mitochondrial gene delivery vector named [triphenylphosphine&#8208;terminated poly(sulfur&#8208;containing thioketal undecafluorohexylamine histamine) and Ide&#8208;terminated poly(sulfur&#8208;containing thioketal undecafluorohexylamine histamine)] (TISUH) is reported to facilitate commendable in situ mitochondrial gene therapy for LHON. TISUH directly targets diseased mitochondria via triphenylphosphine and fluorination addressing the decreasing MMP. In addition, TISUH can be disassembled by high mitochondrial ROS levels to release functional genes for enhancing gene transfection efficiency and fundamentally correcting genetic abnormalities. In both traditional and gene&#8208;mutation&#8208;induced LHON mouse models, TISUH&#8208;mediated gene therapy shows satisfactory curative effect through the sustained therapeutic protein expression in vivo. This work proposes a novel pathologically responsive in situ mitochondrial delivery platform and provides a promising approach for refractory LHON as well as other mtDNA mutated diseases treatments.

         <title>Amphiphilic Copolymers for Versatile, Facile, and In Situ Tunable Surface Biofunctionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PEGylated styrene&#8211;maleic acid(anhydride) copolymers with systematically varied molecular architecture&#8212;anchor polymers&#8212;are introduced for the highly versatile adsorptive surface functionalization of materials. The water&#8208;soluble but highly surface affine copolymers can be equipped with a broad range of bioactive ligands introducing cell&#8208;instructive and antimicrobial surface properties.








Abstract
Precision surface engineering is key to advanced biomaterials. A new platform of PEGylated styrene&#8211;maleic acid copolymers for adsorptive surface biofunctionalization is reported. Balanced amphiphilicity renders the copolymers water&#8208;soluble but strongly affine for surfaces. Fine&#8208;tuning of their molecular architecture provides control over adsorptive anchorage onto specific materials&#8212;which is why they are referred to as &#8220;anchor polymers&#8221; (APs)&#8212;and over structural characteristics of the adsorbed layers. Conjugatable with an array of bioactives&#8212;including cytokine&#8208;complexing glycosaminoglycans, cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;mediating peptides and antimicrobials&#8212;APs can be applied to customize materials for demanding biotechnologies in uniquely versatile, simple, and robust ways. Moreover, homo&#8208; and heterodisplacement of adsorbed APs provide unprecedented means of in situ alteration and renewal of the functionalized surfaces. The related options are exemplified with proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments of controlled bacterial adhesion, human umbilical vein endothelial cell, and induced pluripotent cell growth on AP&#8208;functionalized surfaces.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Derived Nanoparticles with Notch&#8208;1 Suppressor Delivery Promote Hypoxic Cell&#8211;Cell Packing and Inhibit Angiogenesis Acting as a Two&#8208;Edged Sword</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) promote physical tightening of cell&#8211;cell interactions and cell packing, thereby inducing hypoxia as a favorable setting for cancer progression and cartilage development. The conjugation of aptamers to CMNPs suppresses Notch&#8208;1 signaling&#8208;mediated angiogenesis with consequent activation of anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective effects (&#8220;two&#8208;edged sword&#8221;) in a xenograft model of human laryngeal cancer.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;cell interactions regulate intracellular signaling via reciprocal contacts of cell membranes in tissue regeneration and cancer growth, indicating a critical need of membrane&#8208;derived tools in studying these processes. Hence, cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (CMNPs) are produced using tonsil&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSCs) from children owing to their short doubling time. As target cell types, laryngeal cancer cells are compared to&#160;bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived MSCs (BMSCs) because of their cartilage damaging and chondrogenic characteristics, respectively. Treating spheroids of these cell types with CMNPs exacerbates&#160;interspheroid&#160;hypoxia with robust maintenance of the cell&#8211;cell interaction signature for 7 days. Both cell types prefer a hypoxic environment, as opposed to blood vessel formation that is absent in cartilage but is required for cancer growth. Hence, angiogenesis is inhibited by displaying the Notch&#8208;1 aptamer on CMNPs. Consequently, laryngeal cancer growth is suppressed efficiently in contrast to improved chondroprotection observed in a series of cell and animal experiments using a xenograft mouse model of laryngeal cancer.&#160;Altogether, CMNPs execute&#160;a two&#8208;edged sword function of&#160;inducing hypoxic cell&#8211;cell packing, followed by suppressing angiogenesis to promote&#160;laryngeal cancer death and chondrogenesis&#160;simultaneously.&#160;This study presents a previously unexplored therapeutic strategy for anti&#8208;cancer and chondroprotective treatment using CMNPs.

         <title>Supersaturation&#8208;Controlled Growth of Monolithically Integrated Lead&#8208;Free Halide Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Thin Film for High&#8208;Sensitivity Photodetectors</title>

A lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 single&#8208;crystalline thin film, with adjustable thickness and millimeter size, is directly integrated on various substrates including Si wafer, through a supersaturation&#8208;controlled method. Benefiting from the incommensurate lattice match and suitable thinness, this silicon&#8208;compatible perovskite photodetector is superior to most reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;free halide perovskite photodetectors.








Abstract
Monolithical integration of the promising optoelectronic material with mature and inexpensive silicon circuitry contributes to simplifying device geometry, enhancing performance, and expanding new functionalities. Herein, a lead&#8208;free halide perovskite Cs3Bi2I9 single&#8208;crystalline thin film (SCTF), with thickness ranging from 900&#160;nm to 4.1&#160;&#181;m and aspect ratio up to 1666, is directly integrated on various substrates including Si wafer, through a facile and low&#8208;temperature solution&#8208;processing method. The growth kinetics of the lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCTF are elucidated by in situ observation, and the solution supersaturation is controlled to reduce the inverse&#8208;temperature crystallization nucleation density and elongate the evaporation growth. The excellent lattice match and band alignment between Si(111) and Cs3Bi2I9(001) facets promote photogenerated charge dissociation and extraction, resulting in boosting the photoelectric sensitivity by 10&#8211;200 times compared with photodetectors based on other substrates. More importantly, this silicon&#8208;compatible perovskite SCTF photodetector exhibits a high switching ratio of 3000 and a fast response of 1.5 &#181;s, which are higher than most reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lead&#8208;free halide perovskite photodetectors. This work not only gives an in&#8208;depth understanding of the perovskite precursor solution chemistry, but also demonstrates the great potential of monolithical integration of lead&#8208;free halide perovskite SCTF with a silicon wafer for high&#8208;performance photodetectors.

         <title>Pangolin&#8208;Inspired Stretchable, Microwave&#8208;Invisible Metascale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pangolin&#8208;inspired metascale is developed to simultaneously realize stretchable and microwave&#8208;invisible functions. The elastomeric matrix endows the metascale with high stretchability, therefore nondevelopable surface conformality. The overlapping arrangement of electromagnetic dissipative scales ensures the metascale has robust microwave&#8208;absorbing capacity under the interference of mechanical deformation and also plays significant role in resisting out&#8208;of&#8208;plane puncture damage.








Abstract
Microwave&#8208;invisible devices are emerging as a valuable technology in various applications, including soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing structures, and textural camouflages, especially in electronic countermeasures. Unfortunately, conventional microwave&#8208;absorbing metastructures and bulk absorbers are stretching confined, limiting their application in deformable or special&#8208;shaped targets. To overcome such limitations, a conceptually novel soft&#8211;rigid&#8208;connection strategy, inspired by the pangolin, is proposed. Pangolin&#8208;inspired metascale (PIMS), which is a kind of stretchable metamaterial consisting of an electromagnetic dissipative scale (EMD&#8208;scale) and elastomer, is rationally designed. Such a device exhibits robust microwave&#8208;absorbing capacity under the interference of 50% stretching. Besides, profiting from the covering effect and size&#8208;confined effect of EMD&#8208;scale, the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane indentation failure force of PIMS is at least 5 times larger than conventional device. As a proof of concept, the proposed device is conformally pasted on nondevelopable surfaces. For a spherical dome surface, the maximum radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) reduction of PIMS is 6.3&#160;dB larger than that of a conventional device, while for a saddle surface, the bandwidth of 10&#160;dB RCS reduction exhibits an increase of 83%. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop stretchable, nondevelopable surface conformable functional devices.

         <title>A COF&#8208;Like N&#8208;Rich Conjugated Microporous Polytriphenylamine Cathode with Pseudocapacitive Anion Storage Behavior for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Zinc Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;like poriferous polytriphenylamine conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) cathode with a pseudocapacitive anion storage behavior is demonstrated for aqueous zinc dual&#8208;ion batteries. The as&#8208;fabricated electrode displays both high active&#8208;site utilization efficacy (83.2% at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and good cycling stability (87.6% capacity retention at 1000 cycles).








Abstract
Conducting polymers with good electron conductivity and rich redox functional groups are promising cathode candidates for constructing high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. However, the glaring flaw of active&#8208;site underutilization impairs their electrochemical performance. Herein, we&#160;report a poriferous polytriphenylamine conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) cathode capable of accommodating Cl&#8722; anions in a pseudocapative&#8208;dominated manner for energy storage. Its specific 3D, covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;like conjugated network ensures high accessibility efficacy of N active sites (up to 83.2% at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and distinct physicochemical stability (87.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) during repeated charging/discharging courses. Such a robust CMP electrode also leads to a zinc dual&#8208;ion battery device with a high energy density of 236 W h kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 6.8&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, substantially surpassing most recently reported organic&#8208;based zinc batteries. This study paves the way for the rational design of advanced CMP&#8208;based organic cathodes for high&#8208;energy devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Ultrafast Sintering: Exploiting a New Kinetic Region to Fabricate Porous Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, ultrafast, and general method to sinter 3D porous solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) scaffolds on various substrates is developed. The sintered porous SSE demonstrates desired crystallinity, adjustable porous structure, and high electrochemical performance. This method opens a new route toward constructing a range of 3D SSE scaffolds for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applications.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) promise better safety and potentially higher energy density than the conventional liquid&#8208; or gel&#8208;based ones. In practice, the implementation of SSBs often necessitates 3D porous scaffolds made by ceramic solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Herein, a general and facile method to sinter 3D porous scaffolds with a range of ceramic SSEs on various substrates at high temperature in seconds is reported. The high temperature enables rapid reactive sintering toward the desired crystalline phase and expedites the surface diffusion of grains for neck growth; meanwhile, the short sintering duration limits the coarsening, thus accurately controlling the degree of densification to preserve desired porous structures, as well as reducing the loss of volatile elements. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a composite SSE with a good ionic conductivity (i.e., &#8776;1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature) is demonstrated by integrating poly(ethylene oxide) with the 3D porous Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 scaffold sintered by this method. This method opens a new door toward sintering a variety of ceramic&#8208;SSE&#8208;based 3D scaffolds for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applications.

Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular slime mold, is an important model for research into the physical basis of primitive cognition. In an arena containing 3 or 1 inert glass disks, it reliably chooses to grow outward toward the 3 disks. Computational modeling shows how Physarum exploits material properties to extract information about its environment that guides its morphogenesis and behavior.








Abstract
The unicellular protist Physarum polycephalum is an important emerging model for understanding how aneural organisms process information toward adaptive behavior. Here, it is revealed that Physarum can use mechanosensation to reliably make decisions about distant objects in its environment, preferentially growing in the direction of heavier, substrate&#8208;deforming, but chemically inert masses. This long&#8208;range sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing substrate stiffness, or the addition of an inhibitor of mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Physarum does not respond to the absolute magnitude of strain. Computational modeling reveales that Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its perimeter that is distorted above a threshold substrate strain&#8212;a fundamentally novel method of mechanosensation. Using its body as both a distributed sensor array and computational substrate, this aneural organism leverages its unique morphology to make long&#8208;range decisions. Together, these data identify a surprising behavioral preference relying on biomechanical features and quantitatively characterize how the Physarum exploits physics to adaptively regulate its growth and shape.

Fex&#8722;1Sex/MXene/fungus&#8208;derived carbonaceous nanoribbon&#8208;based sodium&#8208;ion and potassium&#8208;ion batteries exhibit high specific sodium&#8208;ion and potassium&#8208;ion storage capacities of 610.9 and 449.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively, and excellent capacity retention at high charge&#8211;discharge rates.








Abstract
Owing to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high energy density, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are becoming the leading candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices replacing lithium&#8208;ion batteries. In this work, a novel Fex&#8722;1Sex heterostructure is prepared on fungus&#8208;derived carbon matrix encapsulated by 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene highly conductive layers, which exhibits high specific sodium ion (Na+) and potassium ion (K+) storage capacities of 610.9 and 449.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively, and excellent capacity retention at high charge&#8211;discharge rates. MXene acts as conductive layers to prevent the restacking and aggregation of Fex&#8722;1Sex sheets on fungus&#8208;derived carbonaceous nanoribbons, while the natural fungus functions as natural nitrogen/carbon source to provide bionic nanofiber network structural skeleton, providing additional accessible pathways for the high&#8208;rate ion transport and satisfying surface&#8208;driven contribution ratios at high sweep rates for both Na/K ions storages. In addition, in situ synchrotron diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements are performed to reveal the mechanisms of storage and de&#8208;/alloying conversion process of Na+ in the Fex&#8722;1Sex/MXene/carbonaceous nanoribbon heterostructure. As a result, the assembled Na/K full cells containing MXene&#8208;supported Fex&#8722;1Sex@carbonaceous anodes possess stable large&#8208;ion storage capabilities.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Assisted Metallization of Mammalian Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformation of mammalian cells into metallic biocomposites with good preservation of the original cellular structures and metallic properties is achieved by taking advantage of polymer chains grafted on and within the cells. The polymer&#8208;assisted cell metallization (PACM) is a versatile biotemplating strategy to fabricate functional metallic biocomposites with different cell types, architectures, and compositions of metal.








Abstract
Developing biotemplating techniques to translate microorganisms and cultured mammalian cells into metallic biocomposites is of great interest for biosensors, electronics, and energy. The metallization of viruses and microbial cells is successfully demonstrated via a genetic engineering strategy or electroless deposition. However, it is difficult to transform mammalian cells into metallic biocomposites because of the complicated genes and the delicate morphological features. Herein, &#8220;polymer&#8208;assisted cell metallization&#8221; (PACM) is reported as a general method for the transformation of mammalian cells into metallic biocomposites. PACM includes a first step of in situ polymerization of functional polymer on the surface and in the interior of the mammalian cells, and a subsequent electroless deposition of metal to convert the polymer&#8208;functionalized cells into metallic biocomposites, which retain the micro&#8208; and nanostructures of the mammalian cells. This new biotemplating method is compatible with different cell types and metals to yield a wide variety of metallic biocomposites with controlled structures and properties.

         <title>A Noninvasive Gut&#8208;to&#8208;Brain Oral Drug Delivery System for Treating Brain Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following oral administration, a prodrug transpasses the intestinal epithelial barrier via M cells, and then undergoes endocytosis by resident macrophages. The macrophage&#8208;hitchhiked prodrug is transported to the circulatory system via the lymphatic system, crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, ultimately penetrating a brain tumor. The tumor&#8208;overexpressed glutathione cleaves the disulfide bond within the prodrug, releasing the active drug, facilitating antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Most orally administered drugs fail to reach the intracerebral regions because of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which are located between the gut and the brain. Herein, an oral prodrug delivery system that can overcome both the IEB and the BBB noninvasively is developed for treating gliomas. The prodrug is prepared by conjugating an anticancer drug on &#946;&#8208;glucans using a disulfide&#8208;containing linker. Following oral administration in glioma&#8208;bearing mice, the as&#8208;prepared prodrug can specifically target intestinal M cells, transpass the IEB, and be phagocytosed/hitchhiked by local macrophages (M&#981;). The M&#981;&#8208;hitchhiked prodrug is transported to the circulatory system via the lymphatic system, crossing the BBB. The tumor&#8208;overexpressed glutathione then cleaves the disulfide bond within the prodrug, releasing the active drug, improving its therapeutic efficacy. These findings reveal that the developed prodrug may serve as a gut&#8208;to&#8208;brain oral drug delivery platform for the well&#8208;targeted treatment of gliomas.

         <title>Borophene via Micromechanical Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromechanical exfoliation of borophene and transfer to arbitrary substrates are experimentally demonstrated, with molecular dynamics simulation providing further validation. While high&#8208;resolution electron imaging provides an atomistic glimpse of the crystallographic phases of borophene, Raman and XPS spectral data establish its chemical phase purity. When heterolayered with gold, borophene exhibits SERS&#8208;based molecular sensing. Borophene&#8208;based heterolayered excitonic devices are thus demonstrated.








Abstract
Borophene, the lightest among all Xenes, possesses extreme electronic mobility along with high carrier density and high Young's modulus. To accomplish device&#8208;quality borophene, novel approaches of realization of monolayers need to be urgently explored. In this work, micromechanical exfoliation is discovered to result in mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layered borophene of device quality. Borophene sheets are successfully fabricated down to monolayer thickness. Distinct crystallographic phases of borophene viz. XRD study reveals crystallographic phase transition from rhombohedral to several other eigen phases of borophene. The role of the destination substrates is held crucial in determining the final phase of the transferred sheet. The exfoliation energy is calculated by density functional theory. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to simulate the exfoliation process. Heterolayers of borophene, with black phosphorene (BP) or with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) atomic sheets, are found to result in photoexcited coupling quantum states. Gold&#8208;coated borophene bestows promising anchoring capability for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Successful demonstration of the electronic behavior of micromechanically exfoliated borophene and excitonic behavior of borophene&#8208;based heterolayers will guide future generation devices not only in electronics and excitonics, but also in thermal management, electronic packaging, hydrogen storage, hybrid energy storage, and clean energy solutions.

&lt;p&gt;Micromechanical exfoliation of borophene and transfer to arbitrary substrates are experimentally demonstrated, with molecular dynamics simulation providing further validation. While high-resolution electron imaging provides an atomistic glimpse of the crystallographic phases of borophene, Raman and XPS spectral data establish its chemical phase purity. When heterolayered with gold, borophene exhibits SERS-based molecular sensing. Borophene-based heterolayered excitonic devices are thus demonstrated.

         <title>Ohmic&#8208;Contact&#8208;Gated Carbon Nanotube Transistors for High&#8208;Performance Analog Amplifiers</title>

         <dc:description>
Increasing demand for small&#8208;signal biological sensing applications requires improved low&#8208;power, high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed analog amplifiers. To achieve this goal, a novel ohmic&#8208;contact&#8208;gated transistor is introduced and demonstrated for solution&#8208;processed semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. These devices achieve the highest reported combination of channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized drive current and channel&#8208;length&#8208;normalized signal gain, resulting in analog amplifiers that are well&#8208;suited for biological and physiological signals.








Abstract
The growing demand for ubiquitous data collection has driven the development of sensing technologies with local data processing. As a result, solution&#8208;processed semiconductors are widely employed due to their compatibility with low&#8208;cost additive manufacturing on a wide range of substrates. However, to fully realize their potential in sensing applications, high&#8208;performance scalable analog amplifiers must be realized. Here, ohmic&#8208;contact&#8208;gated transistors (OCGTs) based on solution&#8208;processed semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes are introduced to address this unmet need. This new device concept enables output current saturation in the short&#8208;channel limit without compromising output current drive. The resulting OCGTs are used in common&#8208;source amplifiers to achieve the highest width&#8208;normalized output current (&#8776;30 &#181;A &#181;m&#8211;1) and length&#8208;scaled signal gain (&#8776;230 &#181;m&#8211;1) to date for solution&#8208;processed semiconductors. The utility of these amplifiers for emerging sensing technologies is demonstrated by the amplification of complex millivolt&#8208;scale analog biological signals including the outputs of electromyography, photoplethysmogram, and accelerometer sensors. Since the OCGT design is compatible with other solution&#8208;processed semiconducting materials, this work establishes a general route to high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed analog electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Reversible Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogue, Nax(FeMnNiCuCo)[Fe(CN)6], is developed as a robust host structure for reversible sodium insertion. Battery cells using the new cathode active material show significantly improved cycling performance and stability, among others due to its nearly zero&#8208;strain operation.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are reported to be efficient sodium storage materials because of the unique advantages of their metal&#8211;organic framework structure. However, the issues of low specific capacity and poor reversibility, caused by phase transitions during charge/discharge cycling, have thus far limited the applicability of these materials. Herein, a new approach is presented to substantially improve the electrochemical properties of PBAs by introducing high entropy into the crystal structure. To achieve this, five different metal species are introduced, sharing the same nitrogen&#8208;coordinated site, thereby increasing the configurational entropy of the system beyond 1.5R. By careful selection of the elements, high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;PBA) presents a quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism, resulting in increased cycling stability and rate capability. The key to such improvement lies in the high entropy and associated effects as well as the presence of several active redox centers. The gassing behavior of PBAs is also reported. Evolution of dimeric cyanogen due to oxidation of the cyanide ligands is detected, which can be attributed to the structural degradation of HE&#8208;PBA during battery operation. By optimizing the electrochemical window, a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is retained after cycling for more than 3000 cycles.

         <title>Autonomous Off&#8208;Equilibrium Morphing Pathways of a Supramolecular Shape&#8208;Memory Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly designable autonomous morphing behaviors are achieved in a supramolecular shape&#8208;memory polymer with strong time&#8211;temperature dependency. To prove the advantages of the molecular design, the benefits of the spatio&#8208;temporal programming are demonstrated by off&#8208;equilibrium multi&#8208;shape&#8208;transformation, self&#8208;evolving sequence&#8208;programmable 4D printing, an &#8220;invisible&#8221;&#8208;color&#8208;based clock, and a time&#8211;temperature indicator.








Abstract
The diverse morphing behaviors of living creatures arise from their unlimited pathways. In contrast, the equilibrium&#8208;driven morphing pathways of common synthetic shape&#8208;shifting materials are very limited. For a shape&#8208;memory polymer (SMP), its recovery from the temporary shape(s) to the permanent shape typically requires external stimulation and follows a single fixed route. Herein, a covalently crosslinked SMP is designed with ample ureidopyrimidinone (UPy) supramolecular moieties in the network. The UPy units endow the SMP with strong time&#8211;temperature dependency, which is explored as a mechanism for spatio&#8208;temporal programming of autonomous shape&#8208;shifting pathways. In particular, the use of digitally controlled photothermal heating provides versatility in control via an off&#8208;equilibrium mechanism. In addition, cooling/heating across its glass transition introduces a locking/unlocking mechanism for its temporal morphing. The benefits of these unique features are demonstrated by multi&#8208;shape&#8208;transformation, an &#8220;invisible&#8221;&#8208;color&#8208;based clock, a time&#8211;temperature indicator, and sequence&#8208;programmable 4D printing.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Light Remote&#8208;Controlled Activation of Cancer Immunotherapy Using Photothermal Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light remote&#8208;controlled activation of cancer immunotherapy is developed using photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs). The CPNs serve as a photo&#8211;heat nanotransducer to trigger the gene transcription of the IFN&#8208;&#947; cytokine. The secreted IFN&#8208;&#947; can sufficiently elicit surrounding tumor&#8208;associated macrophages activation followed by cancer cell killing by immunotherapy.








Abstract
Remote control of the therapeutic process is an ideal strategy for maximizing efficacy and avoiding side effects, especially for cancer immunotherapy. Herein, a conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs)&#8208;mediated optogenetic system for in situ activation of immunotherapy under near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation is reported. This system is composed of photothermal CPNs and interferon&#8208;gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;) plasmid driven by heat shock promoter HSP70. The photothermally responsive CPNs serve as a photo&#8211;heat nanotransducer to trigger the gene transcription of IFN&#8208;&#947; cytokine. The secreted IFN&#8208;&#947; from cancer cells can sufficiently elicit surrounding tumor&#8208;associated macrophages activation through IFN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;JAK&#8208;STAT1 transcription&#8208;factor signaling pathway and finally induce cancer cell killing by immunotherapy. Therefore, this synergetic optogenetic system provides a promising approach to remotely control the process of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Iron Single Atom Catalyzed Quinoline Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron single&#8208;atom catalysts are developed for three&#8208;component oxidative cyclization, affording a wide assortment of multifunctional quinolines and their deuterated derivatives (23 examples including Cavosonstat derivatives) from feedstock anilines and acetophenones.








Abstract
The production of high&#8208;value chemicals by single&#8208;atom catalysis is an attractive proposition for industry owing to its remarkable selectivity. Successful demonstrations to date are mostly based on gas&#8208;phase reactions, and reports on liquid&#8208;phase catalysis are relatively sparse owing to the insufficient activation of reactants by single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), as well as, their instability in solution. Here, mechanically strong, hierarchically porous carbon plates are developed for the immobilization of SACs to enhance catalytic activity and stability. The carbon&#8208;based SACs exhibit excellent activity and selectivity (&#8776;68%) for the synthesis of substituted quinolines by a three&#8208;component oxidative cyclization, affording a wide assortment of quinolines (23 examples) from anilines and acetophenones feedstock in an efficient, atom&#8208;economical manner. Particularly, a Cavosonstat derivative can be synthesized through a one&#8208;step, Fe1&#8208;catalyzed cyclization instead of traditional Suzuki coupling. The strategy is also applicable to the deuteration of quinolines at the fourth position, which is challenging by conventional methods. The synthetic utility of the carbon&#8208;based SAC, together with its reusability and scalability, renders it promising for industrial scale catalysis.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Biomimicry of Antioxidative Melanin Formation and Its Application for Acute Liver Injury Therapy and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to mimic in situ melanin formation for antioxidative applications by synthesizing a PEGylated, phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;protected L&#8208;DOPA (PAD) that can form well&#8208;defined nanoparticles (PADN) is reported. Upon triggering by elevated oxidative species, PADN transform to PEG&#8208;L&#8208;DOPA, which, similar to the biosynthetic pathway of melanin, undergoes oxidization and polymerization to form a melanin analog with effective antioxidative effect and bioimaging feature.








Abstract
Biocompatible nano&#8208;antioxidants composed of natural molecules/materials, such as dopamine and melanin, are of great interest for diverse biomedical applications. However, the lack of understanding of the precise structure of these biomaterials and thus the actual dose of effective components impedes their advancement to translation. Herein, a strategy to mimic in situ melanin formation and explore its antioxidative applications is reported, by developing a PEGylated, phenylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;protected L&#8208;DOPA precursor (PAD) that can self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined nanoparticles (PADN). Exposure to oxidative species leads to deprotection of phenylboronic acids, transforming PADN to PEG&#8208;L&#8208;DOPA, which, similar to the biosynthetic pathway of melanin, can be oxidized and polymerized into an antioxidative melanin&#8208;like structure. With ultrahigh stability and superior antioxidative activity, the PADN shows remarkable efficacy in prevention and treatment of acute liver injury/failure. Moreover, the in situ structure transformation enables PADN to visualize damaged tissue noninvasively by photoacoustic imaging. Overall, a bioinspired antioxidant with precise structure and site&#8208;specific biological activity for theranostics of oxidative stress&#8208;related diseases is described.

         <title>Secreted Expression of mRNA&#8208;Encoded Truncated ACE2 Variants for SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 via Lipid&#8208;Like Nanoassemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lipid&#8208;like compound identified from a combinatorial library enables exogenous mRNA encoding high&#8208;affinity ACE2 decoys to formulate into lipid&#8208;like nanoassemblies. Core&#8211;shell nanostructures render mRNA with durable resistance toward nuclease degradation, enhanced cellular internalization and endosomal escape, along with targeted expression in the spleen. Lipid&#8208;like nanocarriers&#8208;mediated intracellular delivery of synthetic mRNA achieves augmented expression and secretion of decoys for blocking SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.








Abstract
The transfer of foreign synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) into cells is essential for mRNA&#8208;based protein&#8208;replacement therapies. Prophylactic mRNA COVID&#8208;19 vaccines commonly utilize nanotechnology to deliver mRNA encoding SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 vaccine antigens, thereby triggering the body's immune response and preventing infections. In this study, a new combinatorial library of symmetric lipid&#8208;like compounds is constructed, and among which a lead compound is selected to prepare lipid&#8208;like nanoassemblies (LLNs) for intracellular delivery of mRNA. After multiround optimization, the mRNA formulated into core&#8211;shell&#8208;structured LLNs exhibits more than three orders of magnitude higher resistance to serum than the unprotected mRNA, and leads to sustained and high&#8208;level protein expression in mammalian cells. A single intravenous injection of LLNs into mice achieves over 95% mRNA translation in the spleen, without causing significant hematological and histological changes. Delivery of in&#8208;vitro&#8208;transcribed mRNA that encodes high&#8208;affinity truncated ACE2 variants (tACE2v mRNA) through LLNs induces elevated expression and secretion of tACE2v decoys, which is able to effectively block the binding of the receptor&#8208;binding domain of the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 to the human ACE2 receptor. The robust neutralization activity in vitro suggests that intracellular delivery of mRNA encoding ACE2 receptor mimics via LLNs may represent a potential intervention strategy for COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoconductivity and Terahertz Vibrational Dynamics in Double&#8208;Helix SnIP Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast optoelectronic properties of double&#8208;helix tin iodide phosphide (SnIP) nanowires are explored using time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy and quantum&#8208;chemical calculations, providing deep insight into their photophysics, carrier dynamics, and anisotropic electronic structure. The carrier mobility is shown to be remarkably high for such a flexible and ultrasoft material, revealing the potential for future applications of SnIP in flexible electronics.








Abstract
Tin iodide phosphide (SnIP), an inorganic double&#8208;helix material, is a quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals semiconductor that shows promise in photocatalysis and flexible electronics. However, the understanding of the fundamental photophysics and charge transport dynamics of this new material is limited. Here, time&#8208;resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is used to probe the transient photoconductivity of SnIP nanowire films and measure the carrier mobility. With insight into the highly anisotropic electronic structure from quantum chemical calculations, an electron mobility as high as 280&#160;cm2&#8201; V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the double&#8208;helix axis and a hole mobility of 238 cm2&#8201; V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 perpendicular to the double&#8208;helix axis are detected. Additionally, infrared&#8208;active (IR&#8208;active) THz vibrational modes are measured, which shows excellent agreement with first&#8208;principles calculations, and an ultrafast photoexcitation&#8208;induced charge redistribution is observed that reduces the amplitude of a twisting mode of the outer SnI helix on picosecond timescales. Finally, it is shown that the carrier lifetime and mobility are limited by a trap density greater than 1018&#8201;cm&#8722;3. The results provide insight into the optical excitation and relaxation pathways of SnIP and demonstrate a remarkably high carrier mobility for such a soft and flexible material, suggesting that it could be ideally suited for flexible electronics&#160;applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembling Films of Covalent Organic Frameworks Enable Long&#8208;Term, Efficient Cycling of Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and scalable dip&#8208;coating technique allows for the self&#8208;assembly of ultrathin, flexible, and robust films of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) on Zn electrodes. These COFs prevent inherent electrode corrosion and guide compact Zn deposition, in effect delivering excellent capacity retention and stable polarization voltage (&gt;420 h of cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2) in Zn&#8208;ion batteries, including foldable wire&#8208;type batteries. 








Abstract
Despite their safety, nontoxicity, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, zinc aqueous batteries still suffer from limited rechargeability and poor cycle life, largely due to spontaneous surface corrosion and formation of large Zn dendrites by irregular and uneven plating and stripping. In this work, these untoward effects are minimized by covering Zn electrodes with ultrathin layers of covalent organic frameworks, COFs. These nanoporous and mechanically flexible films form by self&#8208;assembly&#8212;via the straightforward and scalable dip&#8208;coating technique&#8212;and permit efficient mass and charge transport while suppressing surface corrosion and growth of large Zn dendrites. The batteries demonstrated have excellent capacity retention and stable polarization voltage for over 420 h of cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2. The COF films essential for these improvements can be readily deposited over large areas and curvilinear supports, enabling, for example, foldable wire&#8208;type batteries.

         <title>Polymeric Aggregate&#8208;Embodied Hybrid Nitric&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Scavenging and Sequential Drug&#8208;Releasing Hydrogel for Combinatorial Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>

         <dc:description>
A polymeric aggregate&#8208;embodied hybrid hydrogel is presented, which rapidly gelates in situ via a &#8220;click&#8221; cycloaddition reaction and shows promising properties for the combinatorial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, including nitric oxide scavenging, on&#8208;demand dual&#8208;stage drug releasing, and self&#8208;healing capabilities.








Abstract
Selective depletion of overproduced nitric oxide (NO) with nanoscavengers is a promising approach for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), preventing both oxidative/nitrosative stress and the upregulation of immune cells. However, its practical applications are limited owing to the minimum time interval between intra&#8208;articular injections and unwanted off&#8208;target NO depletion. Herein, the rational design of an injectable in situ polymeric aggregate&#8208;embodied hybrid NO&#8208;scavenging and sequential drug&#8208;releasing (M&#8208;NO) gel platform for the combinatorial treatment of RA by incorporating a &#8220;clickable&#8221; NO&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker (DA&#8208;NOCCL) is reported. This network is held together with polymeric aggregates to achieve a self&#8208;healing capability for visco&#8208;supplementation and on&#8208;demand dual drug (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic)&#8208;releasing properties, depending on the NO concentration. Moreover, consecutive NO&#8208;scavenging action reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels in lipopolysaccharides&#8208;stimulated macrophage cell lines in vitro. Finally, the intra&#8208;articularly injected M&#8208;NO gel with anti&#8208;inflammatory dexamethasone significantly alleviates the symptoms of RA, with negligible toxicity, in animal models. It is believed that this novel M&#8208;NO gel platform will provide a guideline for the combinatorial treatment of RA and various NO&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Mapping of Moir&#233; Superlattices by Hyperspectral Raman Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; superlattices produced through artificial stacking are often quite inhomogeneous and are challenging to characterize noninvasively. In this work, interlayer&#8208;breathing mode and moir&#233; phonons are proven to be highly susceptible to the moir&#233; period, and enable large&#8208;scale mapping of moir&#233; superlattices by hyperspectral Raman imaging.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices can induce correlated&#8208;electronic phases in twisted van der Waals materials: strongly correlated quantum phenomena emerge, such as superconductivity and the Mott&#8208;insulating state. However, moir&#233; superlattices produced through artificial stacking can be quite inhomogeneous, which hampers the development of a clear correlation between the moir&#233; period and the emerging electrical and optical properties. Here, it is demonstrated in twisted&#8208;bilayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides that low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering can be utilized not only to detect atomic reconstruction, but also to map out the inhomogeneity of the moir&#233; lattice over large areas. The method is established based on the finding that both the interlayer&#8208;breathing mode and moir&#233; phonons are highly susceptible to the moir&#233; period and provide characteristic fingerprints. Hyperspectral Raman imaging visualizes microscopic domains of a 5&#176; twisted&#8208;bilayer sample with an effective twist&#8208;angle resolution of about 0.1&#176;. This ambient methodology can be conveniently implemented to characterize and preselect high&#8208;quality areas of samples for subsequent device fabrication, and for transport and optical experiments.

         <title>Spontaneous Formation of Upper Gradient 2D Structure for Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic ammonium salt, 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) benzylamine, is introduced to form a quasi&#8208;2D hybrid perovskite by a one&#8208;step spin&#8208;coating method. Due to the relatively low surface energy of fluorinated molecules, an upper gradient low&#8208;dimensional structure is formed spontaneously from top to bottom, and more stable devices are obtained with a power conversion efficiency of 17.07%.








Abstract
Highly efficient and stable quasi&#8208;2D hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using hydrophobic 4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl) benzylamine (4TFBZA) as the spacer cation are successfully demonstrated. It is found that the incorporation of hydrophobic 4TFBZA into MAPbI3 can effectively induce a spontaneous upper gradient 2D (SUG&#8208;2D) structure, passivate the trap states, and restrain the ion motion. Meanwhile, the strong hydrogen bonding of F&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#63743;N between 4TFBZA ions and methylamine ions can effectively suppress the decomposition of perovskite, which gives the device a better thermal stability. Besides, due to the SUG&#8208;2D structure with hydrophobic 4TFBZA, the device also exhibits a better moisture stability. The SUG&#8208;2D&#8208;structure&#8208;based device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 17.07% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.10&#160;V and a notable fill factor of 71%. This work provides a new strategy for constructing efficient and stable quasi&#8208;2D PSCs, and it is an inspiration for the packaging strategy of perovskites.

         <title>A Stretchable and Transparent Electrode Based on PEGylated Silk Fibroin for In Vivo Dual&#8208;Modal Neural&#8208;Vascular Activity Probing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent, stretchable neural electrodes based on silk hydrogel are demonstrated. PEGylation improves the stretchability and water stability of the silk hydrogel, and contributes to a robust interface with poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate. The hydrogel electrode allows a highly stretchable electrical coupling with tissues, which facilitates simultaneous electrical and optical interrogation of neural circuits. This work offers an efficient hydrogel tool for neuroscience and clinical applications.








Abstract
Transparent electrodes that form seamless contact and enable optical interrogation at the electrode&#8211;brain interface are potentially of high significance for neuroscience studies. Silk hydrogels can offer an ideal platform for transparent neural interfaces owing to their superior biocompatibility. However, conventional silk hydrogels are too weak and have difficulties integrating with highly conductive and stretchable electronics. Here, a transparent and stretchable hydrogel electrode based on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and PEGylated silk protein is reported. PEGylated silk protein with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) improves the Young's modulus to 1.51&#8211;10.73 MPa and the stretchability to &#8776;400% from conventional silk hydrogels (&lt;10 kPa). The PEGylated silk also helps form a&#160;robust interface with PEDOT:PSS thin film, making the hydrogel electrode synergistically incorporate superior stretchability (&#8776;260%), stable electrical performance (&#8776;4 months), and a low sheet resistance (&#8776;160 &#177; 56 &#937; sq&#8722;1). Finally, the electrode facilitates efficient electrical recording, and stimulation with unobstructed optical interrogation and rat&#8208;brain imaging are demonstrated. The highly transparent and stretchable hydrogel electrode offers a practical tool for neuroscience and paves the way for a harmonized tissue&#8211;electrode interface.

PEGylation improves the stretchability and water stability of the silk hydrogel, and contributes to a robust interface with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate. The hydrogel electrode allows a highly stretchable electrical coupling with tissues, which facilitates simultaneous electrical and optical interrogation of neural circuits. This work offers an efficient hydrogel tool for neuroscience and clinical applications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent electrodes that form seamless contact and enable optical interrogation at the electrode&#8211;brain interface are potentially of high significance for neuroscience studies. Silk hydrogels can offer an ideal platform for transparent neural interfaces owing to their superior biocompatibility. However, conventional silk hydrogels are too weak and have difficulties integrating with highly conductive and stretchable electronics. Here, a transparent and stretchable hydrogel electrode based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and PEGylated silk protein is reported. PEGylated silk protein with poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEGDE) improves the Young's modulus to 1.51&#8211;10.73 MPa and the stretchability to &#8776;400% from conventional silk hydrogels (&amp;lt;10 kPa). The PEGylated silk also helps form a&#160;robust interface with PEDOT:PSS thin film, making the hydrogel electrode synergistically incorporate superior stretchability (&#8776;260%), stable electrical performance (&#8776;4 months), and a low sheet resistance (&#8776;160 &#177; 56 &#937; sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Finally, the electrode facilitates efficient electrical recording, and stimulation with unobstructed optical interrogation and rat-brain imaging are demonstrated. The highly transparent and stretchable hydrogel electrode offers a practical tool for neuroscience and paves the way for a harmonized tissue&#8211;electrode interface.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Mobile and Self&#8208;Powered Micro&#8208;Flow Pump Based on Triboelectricity Driven Electroosmosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the unique output characteristics of the triboelectric nanogenerator, a mobile and motion&#8208;controlled triboelectric electroosmotic pump (TEOP) is proposed with much higher micro&#8208;flow generation efficiency compared to commercial high&#8208;voltage sources. This TEOP can produce a controllable micro&#8208;flow by mechanical movements and may contribute a more conducive option to achieve wider applications in motion&#8208;activated micro/nanofluidic transportation and manipulation.








Abstract
Electroosmotic pumps have been widely used in microfluidic systems. However, traditional high&#8208;voltage (HV)&#8208;sources are bulky in size and induce numerous accessional reactions, which largely reduce the system's portability and efficiency. Herein, a motion&#8208;controlled, highly efficient micro&#8208;flow pump based on triboelectricity driven electroosmosis is reported. Utilizing the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a strong electric field can be formed between two electrodes in the microfluidic channel with an electric double layer, thus driving the controllable electroosmotic flow by biomechanical movements. The performance and operation mechanism of this triboelectric electroosmotic pump (TEOP) is systematically studied and analyzed using a basic free&#8208;standing mode TENG. The TEOP produces &#8776;600 nL min&#8722;1 micro&#8208;flow with a Joule heat down to 1.76 J cm&#8722;3 nL&#8722;1 compared with &#8776;50 nL min&#8722;1 and 8.12 J cm&#8722;3 nL&#8722;1 for an HV&#8208;source. The advantages of economy, efficiency, portability, and safety render the TEOP a more conducive option to achieve wider applications in motion&#8208;activated micro/nanofluidic transportation and manipulation.

         <title>3D Printing a Biomimetic Bridge&#8208;Arch Solar Evaporator for Eliminating Salt Accumulation with Desalination and Agricultural Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel biomimetic 3D solar evaporator for efficient interfacial water evaporation is constructed, inspired by the superfast liquid transportation property of the peristome surface of Nepenthes alata and an arch bridge design. With peristome&#8208;mimetic microstructures as water transportation channels, a double&#8208;layer water film is formed to eliminate salt accumulation, ensure long&#8208;term evaporation, and develop self&#8208;sustainable agricultural cultivation.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation has been considered a sustainable method to obtain clean water through desalination. However, its further application is limited by the complicated preparation strategy, poor salt rejection, and durability. Herein, inspired by superfast water transportation of the Nepenthes alata peristome surface and continuous bridge&#8208;arch design in architecture, a biomimetic 3D bridge&#8208;arch solar evaporator is proposed to induce Marangoni flow for long&#8208;term salt rejection. The formed double&#8208;layer 3D liquid film on the evaporator is composed of a confined water film for water supplementation and a free&#8208;flowing water film with ultrafast directional Marangoni convection for salt rejection, which functions cooperatively to endow the 3D evaporator with all&#8208;in&#8208;one function including superior solar&#8208;driven water evaporation (1.64 kg m&#8208;2 h&#8208;1, 91% efficiency for pure water), efficient solar desalination, and long&#8208;term salt&#8208;rejecting property (continuous 200 h in 10 wt% saline water) without any post&#8208;cleaning treatment. The design principle of the 3D structures is provided for extending the application of Marangoni&#8208;driven salt rejection and the investigation of structure&#8208;design&#8208;induced liquid film control in the solar desalination field. Furthermore, excellent mechanical and chemical stability is proved, where a self&#8208;sustainable and solar&#8208;powered desalination&#8211;cultivation platform is developed, indicating promising application for agricultural cultivation.

         <title>Plasmon&#8208;Driven Catalytic Chemotherapy Augments Cancer Immunotherapy through Induction of Immunogenic Cell Death and Blockage of IDO Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent hybrid nanomedicine is developed with the ability to co&#8208;deliver an indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor and chemotherapeutic prodrug. Precise drug release and activation can be achieved based on the phosphate&#8208;responsiveness and plasmon&#8208;driven catalysis to realize chemo&#8208;immunotherapy, which greatly suppresses tumor growth by promoting intratumoral accumulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes concomitant with the downregulation of regulatory T cells.








Abstract
Clinical trials confirm the combination of indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) blockade and immunogenic chemotherapy represents a brilliant future in cancer therapy. However, it remains challenging to precisely activate chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in situ to avoid side effects from the systemic administrations and reverse the poor immunogenicity and immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumor sites. Herein, a hybrid nanomedicine (&#8220;RPMANB NPs&#8221;) to co&#8208;deliver an IDO inhibitor (NLG919) and a chemotherapeutic prodrug to amplify the therapeutic benefits are designed. Attributed to the delicate surface engineering, the RPMANB NPs possess excellent pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation. The loaded NLG919 are released inside cancer tissues/cells due to the collapse of the metal&#8211;organic framework platform triggered by the highly concentrated phosphate, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by suppressing IDO activity. The potent chemotherapeutic drug is precisely activated through a highly efficient plasmon&#8208;driven catalysis in the presence of near&#8208;infrared light, eliciting antitumor immunity by triggering immunogenic cell death and avoiding side effects through in situ activation of chemotherapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that the chemo&#8208;immunotherapy greatly suppresses the tumor growth by promoting intratumoral accumulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and downregulating regulatory T cells. This work establishes a robust delivery platform to overcome the current obstacles of tumor treatments by combining precisely activatable chemotherapy with immunotherapy.

         <title>Reviving the &#8220;Schottky&#8221; Barrier for Flexible Polymer Dielectrics with a Superior 2D Nanoassembly Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile nanocoating comprising hundreds of highly oriented organic/inorganic alternating nanolayers is self&#8208;coassembled on the surface of polymer films to revive the Schottky charge&#8208;injection barrier. This new interface engineering strategy allows a significant elevation of the operating field for organic insulators by 45% and a 7&#215; improvement in discharge efficiency for Kapton at 150&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The organic insulator&#8211;metal interface is the most important junction in flexible electronics. The strong band offset of organic insulators over the Fermi level of electrodes should theoretically impart a sufficient impediment for charge injection known as the Schottky barrier. However, defect formation through Anderson localization due to topological disorder in polymers leads to reduced barriers and hence cumbersome devices. A facile nanocoating comprising hundreds of highly oriented organic/inorganic alternating nanolayers is self&#8208;coassembled on the surface of polymer films to revive the Schottky barrier. Carrier injection over the enhanced barrier is further shunted by anisotropic 2D conduction. This new interface engineering strategy allows a significant elevation of the operating field for organic insulators by 45% and a 7&#215; improvement in discharge efficiency for Kapton at 150&#160;&#176;C. This superior 2D nanocoating thus provides a defect&#8208;tolerant approach for effective reviving of the Schottky barrier, one century after its discovery, broadly applicable for flexible electronics.

Biomechanical Signaling
Physarum polycephalum, a slime mold with one cell and no brain, is a remarkable new model for understanding basal cognition. Its living material deforms its own structure to interact with the objects around it. In article number 2008161, Michael Levin and co&#8208;workers show that Physarum senses strain in its substrate, using biomechanical signaling to assess the environment and express its preferences as directional growth decisions.

Nanocoatings
In article number 2101374, Yang Cao, Luyi Sun, and co&#8208;workers present a layered nanocoating comprising hundreds of highly oriented organic/inorganic alternating nanolayers on the polymer surface to revive the Schottky barrier for effective charge&#8208;injection blocking. The superior 2D assembly leads to a flexible material architecture at the electrode&#8211;dielectric interface, thus providing a novel design strategy for high&#8208;performance dielectrics for integrated flexible electronics.

Moir&#233; Superlattices
Moir&#233; superlattices produced through artificial stacking are often quite challenging to characterize noninvasively. In article number 2008333, Kai&#8208;Qiang Lin, Christian Sch&#252;ller, and co&#8208;workers present a hyperspectral Raman imaging method to achieve large&#8208;scale mapping of moir&#233; superlattices. The method is based on the finding that both interlayer&#8208;breathing mode and moir&#233; phonons are highly susceptible to the moir&#233; period.

Hydrogels
In article number 2008793, Won Jong Kim and co&#8208;workers introduce an injectable in situ polymeric aggregate&#8208;embodied hybrid hydrogel (M&#8208;NO gel) to achieve nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;scavenging and sequential drug&#8208;release for the combinatorial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. This novel M&#8208;NO gel platform incorporated with a &#8220;clickable&#8221; NO&#8208;cleavable crosslinker is expected to prove a guideline for the combinatorial treatment of various NO&#8208;related diseases.

Cathode Materials
In article number 2101342, Yuan Ma, Ben Breitung, Torsten Brezesinski and co&#8208;workers report the introduction of high (configurational) entropy into Prussian blue analogues to achieve a stable cathode host material for reversible sodium storage. Especially, Nax(FeMnNiCuCo)[Fe(CN)6] is shown to exhibit much improved cycling performance, among others, due to its nearly zero&#8208;strain operation upon electrochemical reaction with sodium.

Especially, Na&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;(FeMnNiCuCo)[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] is shown to exhibit much improved cycling performance, among others, due to its nearly zero-strain operation upon electrochemical reaction with sodium.

         <title>General Design Concept for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development and exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is of enormous significance for achieving industrialization. The advanced progress of precise synthesis and practical application of SACs is summarized. Thereafter, the main challenges and future opportunities of large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs are discussed.








Abstract
As a new and popular material, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for numerous important reactions, and show great potential in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high atom utilization efficiency and the controllable characteristics of the active sites. The composition and coordination would determine the geometric and electronic structures of SACs, and thus greatly influence the catalytic performance. Based on atom economy, rational design and controllable synthesis of SACs have become central tasks in the fields of low&#8208;cost and green catalysis. Herein, an introduction to the recent progress in the precise synthesis of SACs including the regulation of the coordination structure and the choice of different systems is presented. Thereafter, the potentials of SACs in different applications are comprehensively summarized and discussed. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the recent developments regarding the large&#8208;scale preparation of SACs is provided, including the major issues and prospects for industrialization. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities of rapid large&#8208;scale industrialization of SACs are briefly discussed.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Capacitive Sensors with Different Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications of several popular microstructures that are widely employed in capacitive sensors are summarized. A microstructured dielectric layer or electrode can improve sensor sensitivity, reduce hysteresis, and endow the rigid electronic device with excellent elastic stretchability, which is an essential part of next&#8208;generation wearable devices and soft robots.








Abstract
Recently, sensors that can imitate human skin have received extensive attention. Capacitive sensors have a simple structure, low loss, no temperature drift, and other excellent properties, and can be applied in the fields of robotics, human&#8211;machine interactions, medical care, and health monitoring. Polymer matrices are commonly employed in flexible capacitive sensors because of their high flexibility. However, their volume is almost unchanged when pressure is applied, and they are inherently viscoelastic. These shortcomings severely lead to high hysteresis and limit the improvement in sensitivity. Therefore, considerable efforts have been applied to improve the sensing performance by designing different microstructures of materials. Herein, two types of sensors based on the applied forces are discussed, including pressure sensors and strain sensors. Currently, five types of microstructures are commonly used in pressure sensors, while four are used in strain sensors. The advantages, disadvantages, and practical values of the different structures are systematically elaborated. Finally, future perspectives of microstructures for capacitive sensors are discussed, with the aim of providing a guide for designing advanced flexible and stretchable capacitive sensors via ingenious human&#8208;made microstructures.

         <title>Ice Templating Soft Matter: Fundamental Principles and Fabrication Approaches to Tailor Pore Structure and Morphology and Their Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ice templating is a simple, accessible, and scalable technique for the fabrication of porous materials. It allows control over the pore morphology by controlling ice formation in a material solution, suspension, or slurry. The fundamental principles, fabrication and characterization approaches, and biomedical applications of ice templating in polymer&#8208;based biomaterials are reviewed.








Abstract
Porous scaffolds are widely used in biomedical applications where pore size and morphology influence a range of biological processes, including mass transfer of solutes, cellular interactions and organization, immune responses, and tissue vascularization, as well as drug delivery from biomaterials. Ice templating, one of the most widely utilized techniques for the fabrication of porous materials, allows control over pore morphology by controlling ice formation in a suspension of solutes. By fine&#8208;tuning freezing and solute parameters, ice templating can be used to incorporate pores with tunable morphological features into a wide range of materials using a simple, accessible, and scalable process. While soft matter is widely ice templated for biomedical applications and includes commercial and clinical products, the principles underpinning its ice templating are not reviewed as well as their inorganic counterparts. This review describes and critically evaluates fundamental principles, fabrication and characterization approaches, and biomedical applications of ice templating in polymer&#8208;based biomaterials. It describes the utility of porous scaffolds in biomedical applications, highlighting biological mechanisms impacted by pore features, outlines the physical and thermodynamic mechanisms underpinning ice templating, describes common fabrication setups, critically evaluates complexities of ice templating specific to polymers, and discusses future directions in this field.

         <title>Weaving Enzymes with Polymeric Shells for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in enzymes wrapped with protective polymer shells for biomedical applications are summarized. Particular emphasis is given to physical adsorption and chemical conjugation with specific examples of these conjugates/hybrid applications for cancer therapy, detection, and imaging. Finally, a conclusion is drawn and key points are also highlighted in detail.








Abstract
Enzyme therapeutics have received increasing attention due to their high biological specificity, outstanding catalytic efficiency, and impressive therapeutic outcomes. Protecting and delivering enzymes into target cells while retaining enzyme catalytic efficiency is a big challenge. Wrapping of enzymes with rational designed polymer shells, rather than trapping them into large nanoparticles such as liposomes, have been widely explored because they can protect the folded state of the enzyme and make post&#8208;functionalization easier. In this review, the methods for wrapping up enzymes with protective polymer shells are mainly focused on. It is aimed to provide a toolbox for the rational design of polymeric enzymes by introducing methods for the preparation of polymeric enzymes including physical adsorption and chemical conjugation with specific examples of these conjugates/hybrid applications. Finally, a conclusion is drawn and key points are emphasized.

         <title>Rational Design of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts: From Theoretical Understandings to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle and theoretical understanding of single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), followed by representative synthesis strategies and their electrocatalytic applications in the oxygen reduction reaction, water dissociation, oxidation of small organic molecules, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction, are systematically reviewed.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted increasing attention due to their nearly 100% atomic utilization and excellent catalytic performance. However, current fundamental comprehension and summaries to reveal the underlying relationship between single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) and corresponding catalytic application are rarely reported. Herein, the fundamental understandings and intrinsic mechanisms underlying SACs and corresponding electrocatalytic applications are systemically summarized. Different preparation strategies are presented to reveal the synthetic strategies with engineering the well&#8208;defined SACs on the basis of theoretical principle (size effect, metal&#8211;support interactions, electronic structure effect, and coordination environment effect). Then, an overview of the electrocatalytic applications is presented, including oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxidation of small organic molecules, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. The underlying structure&#8211;performance relationship between SACs and electrocatalytic reactions is also discussed in depth to expound the enhancement mechanisms. Finally, a summary is provided and a perspective supplied to demonstrate the current challenges and opportunities for rational designing, synthesizing, and modulating the advanced SACs toward electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Nitrogen&#8211;Carbon Catalysts of Specifically Coordinated Configurations toward Typical Electrochemical Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 34, August 26, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) materials with specifically coordinated configurations have attracted board interest in energy storage and conversion technologies. A detailed summary of the M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts, including synthetic strategies, characterization techniques, and the typical electrochemical redox reactions, is particularly important to comprehensively understand the catalytic mechanism in&#8208;depth and rationally design high active M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with specific configurations.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) material with specifically coordinated configurations is a promising alternative to costly Pt&#8208;based catalysts. In the past few years, great progress is made in the studies of M&#8211;N&#8211;C materials, including the structure modulation and local coordination environment identification via advanced synthetic strategies and characterization techniques, which boost the electrocatalytic performances and deepen the understanding of the underlying fundamentals. In this review, the most recent advances of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with specifically coordinated configurations of M&#8211;Nx (x&#160;= 1&#8211;6) are summarized as comprehensively as possible, with an emphasis on the synthetic strategy, characterization techniques, and applications in typical electrocatalytic reactions of the oxygen reduction reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, CO2 reduction reaction, etc., along with mechanistic exploration by experiments and theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the challenges and potential perspectives for the future development of M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts are discussed.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Picosecond Non&#8208;Equilibrium States in the Amorphous Phase of GeTe Phase&#8208;Change Material Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sub&#8208;picosecond response of amorphous GeTe thin film to femtosecond laser excitation is investigated using frequency&#8208;domain interferometry and ab initio molecular dynamics. The results shed a new light on the optically highly excited states in chalcogenide materials involved in both important processes: phase&#8208;change materials in memory devices and ovonic threshold switching phenomenon induced by a static field.








Abstract
The sub&#8208;picosecond response of amorphous germanium telluride thin film to a femtosecond laser excitation is investigated using frequency&#8208;domain interferometry and ab initio molecular dynamics. The time&#8208;resolved measurement of the surface dynamics reveals a shrinkage of the film with a dielectric properties&#8217; response faster than 300 fs. The systematic ab initio molecular dynamics simulations in non&#8208;equilibrium conditions allow the atomic configurations to be retrieved for ionic temperature from 300 to 1100 K and width of the electron distribution from 0.001 to 1.0 eV. Local order of the structures is characterized by in&#8208;depth analysis of the angle distribution, phonon modes, and pair distribution function, which evidence a transition toward a new amorphous electronic excited state close in bonding/structure to the liquid state. The results shed a new light on the optically highly excited states in chalcogenide materials involved in both important processes: phase&#8208;change materials in memory devices and ovonic threshold switching phenomenon induced by a static&#160;field.

         <title>Hybrid Dielectric Films of Inkjet&#8208;Printable Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of core&#8211;shell nanoparticle dielectric that is suitable for inkjet printing is presented. Gold cores are covalently grafted with polystyrene. The resulting inks are used to spin&#8208;coat and inkjet&#8208;print dielectric films. The covalently attached shell prevents percolation and ensures high dielectric constants without the risk of dielectric breakdown.








Abstract
A new type of hybrid core&#8211;shell nanoparticle dielectric that is suitable for inkjet printing is introduced. Gold cores (dcore&#160;&#8776; 4.5 nm diameter) are covalently grafted with thiol&#8208;terminated polystyrene (Mn&#160;= 11000 Da and Mn&#160;= 5000 Da) and used as inks to spin&#8208;coat and inkjet&#8208;print dielectric films. The dielectric layers have&#160;metal volume fractions of 5 to 21 vol% with either random or face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic structures depending on the polymer length and grafting density. Films with 21 vol% metal have&#160;dielectric constants of 50@1 Hz. Structural and electrical characterization using transmission electron microscopy, small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and impedance spectroscopy indicates that classical random capacitor&#8211;resistor network models partially describe this hybrid material but fail at high metal fractions, where the covalently attached shell prevents percolation and ensures high dielectric constants without the risk of dielectric breakdown. A comparison of disordered to ordered films indicates that the network structure affects dielectric properties less than the metal content. The applicability of the new dielectric material is demonstrated by formulating inkjet inks and printing devices. An inkjet&#8208;printed capacitor with an area of 0.79 mm2 and a 17 nm thick dielectric had&#160;a capacitance of 2.2&#177;0.1&#8201;nF@1&#8201;kHz.

         <title>Passivation of the Buried Interface via Preferential Crystallization of 2D Perovskite on Metal Oxide Transport Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination limits the open&#8208;circuit voltage of perovskite solar cells. A buried interface passivation strategy is developed that can be used across metal oxide transport layers. Perovskite precursors containing large organic cations with high affinity for the substrate spontaneously form a 2D passivation layer on the underlying metal oxides, which reduces interfacial recombination by 72%.








Abstract
The open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of perovskite solar cells is limited by non&#8208;radiative recombination at perovskite/carrier transport layer (CTL) interfaces. 2D perovskite post&#8208;treatments offer a means to passivate the top interface; whereas, accessing and passivating the buried interface underneath the perovskite film requires new material synthesis strategies. It is posited that perovskite ink containing species that bind strongly to substrates can spontaneously form a passivating layer with the bottom CTL. The concept using organic spacer cations with rich &#63743;NH2 groups is implemented, where readily available hydrogens have large binding affinity to under&#8208;coordinated oxygens on the metal oxide substrate surface, inducing preferential crystallization of a thin 2D layer at the buried interface. The passivation effect of this 2D layer is examined using steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy: the 2D interlayer suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination at the buried perovskite/CTL interface, leading to a 72% reduction in surface recombination velocity. This strategy enables a 65&#160;mV increase in Voc for NiOx based p&#8211;i&#8211;n devices, and a 100&#160;mV increase in Voc for SnO2&#8208;based n&#8211;i&#8211;p devices. Inverted solar cells with 20.1% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for 1.70&#160;eV and 22.9% PCE for 1.55&#160;eV bandgap perovskites are demonstrated.

Metal&#8208; and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (M&#8211;N&#8211;C) materials as a unique class of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have increasingly attracted attention as the replacement of platinum for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER); however, their employment as HER electrodes at high current densities of industrial level remains a grand challenge. Herein, an aligned porous carbon film embedded with single&#8208;atom Co&#8211;N&#8211;C sites of exceptional activity and stability at high current densities is designed. Within the film, the atomic CoNx moieties exhibit high intrinsic activity, while the multiscale porosity of the carbon frameworks with vertically aligned microchannels afford facilitated mass transfer under the conditions of high production rate and ultrathick electrodes. Moreover, the superwetting properties of the film promote electrolyte wetting and ensure the timely removal of the evolving H2 gas bubbles. The as&#8208;designed film can work as an efficient HER electrode to deliver 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acid at overpotentials of 272 and 343&#160;mV, respectively, and can operate uninterruptedly and stably at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for at least 32 h under static conditions. These findings pave the road toward the rational design of SACs with improved activity and stability at high current densities in gas&#8208;evolving electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>A Powerful One&#8208;Step Puffing Carbonization Method for Construction of Versatile Carbon Composites with High&#8208;Efficiency Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A powerful one&#8208;step puffing carbonization technology is proposed to synthesize versatile multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites (e.g. carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, etc.) with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension and tunable composition on a large scale. As a representative example, a sulfur&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (SCPC)/Li2S electrode shows extraordinary performance with superior rate capability and ultrastable cycling life.








Abstract
Carbon materials play a critical role in the advancement of electrochemical energy storage and conversion. Currently, it is still a great challenge to fabricate versatile carbon&#8208;based composites with controlled morphology, adjustable dimension, and tunable composition by a one&#8208;step synthesis process. In this work, a powerful one&#8208;step maltose&#8208;based puffing carbonization technology is reported to construct multiscale carbon&#8208;based composites on large scale. A quantity of composite examples (e.g., carbon/metal oxides, carbon/metal nitrides, carbon/metal carbides, carbon/metal sulfides, carbon/metals, metal/semiconductors, carbon/carbons) are prepared and demonstrated with required properties. These well&#8208;designed composites show advantages of large porosity, hierarchical porous structure, high conductivity, tunable components, and proportion. The formation mechanism of versatile carbon composites is attributed to the puffing&#8208;carbonization of maltose plus in situ carbothermal reaction between maltose and precursors. As a representative example, Li2S is in situ implanted into a hierarchical porous cross&#8208;linked puffed carbon (CPC) matrix to verify its application in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The designed S&#8208;doped CPC/Li2S cathode shows superior electrochemical performance with higher rate capacity (621 mAh g&#8211;1 at 2 C), smaller polarization and enhanced long&#8208;term cycles as compared to other counterparts. The research provides a general way for the construction of multifunctional component&#8208;adjustable carbon composites for advanced energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Stretchable and Highly Permeable Nanofibrous Sensors for Detecting Complex Human Body Motion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and fabrication of stretchable and highly permeable nanofibrous sensors made from polyaniline is reported. The device produces an intimate connection with solid or living objects and has a very precise performance in discriminating between bending and twisting stimuli at different angles and speeds, as well as in the detection of complex human&#8208;body motions.








Abstract
Wearable strain sensors have been attracting special attention in the detection of human posture and activity, as well as for the assessment of physical rehabilitation and kinematics. However, it is a challenge to fabricate stretchable and comfortable&#8208;to&#8208;wear permeable strain sensors that can provide highly accurate and continuous motion recording while exerting minimal constraints and maintaining low interference with the body. Herein, covalently grafting nanofibrous polyaniline (PANI) onto stretchable elastomer nanomeshes is reported to obtain a freestanding ultrathin (varying from 300 to 10 000&#160;nm) strain sensor that has high gas permeability (10&#8211;33&#160;mg h&#8211;1). The sensor demonstrates a low weight and can be directly laminated onto the dynamic human skin for long periods of time. The sensor, which produces an intimate connection with solid or living objects, has a stable performance with excellent sustainability, linearity, durability, and low hysteresis. It exibits excellent performance for continuous interrogation of complex movements, mimicking muscle activities, and resembling brain activity. This includes a very precise discrimination of bending and twisting stimuli at different angles (1&#8211;180&#176;) and speeds (3&#8211;18&#160;rpm) and very low exertion of counter&#8208;interference. These results imply the utility of this appraoch for advanced developments of robotic e&#8208;skins or e&#8208;muscles.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Piezo&#8208;Bioelectric Device Regulates Tendon Repair&#8208;Associated Signaling Pathways through Modulation of Mechanosensitive Ion Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under physiological conditions, ion&#8208;channels activity limit membrane depolarization and regulate ion concentration&#8208;dependent signaling cascades. In response to injury or mechanical loading, the activity and expression of ion&#8208;channels increases, and unspecific tissue&#8208;repair signaling pathways activate, resulting in ectopic calcifications. By modulating mechanosensitive ion&#8208;channels&#8217; expression, electromechanical stimulation regulates specific signaling pathways activation to promote tendon over bone formation processes.








Abstract
Tendon disease constitutes an unmet clinical need and remains a critical challenge in the field of orthopaedic surgery. Innovative solutions are required to overcome the limitations of current tendon grafting approaches, and bioelectronic therapies show promise in treating musculoskeletal diseases, accelerating functional recovery through the activation of tissue regeneration&#8208;specific signaling pathways. Self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, particularly piezoelectric materials, represent a paradigm shift in biomedicine, negating the need for battery or external powering and complementing existing mechanotherapy to accelerate the repair processes. Here, the dynamic response of tendon cells to a piezoelectric collagen&#8208;analogue scaffold comprised of aligned nanoscale fibers made of the ferroelectric material poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) is shown. It is demonstrated that motion&#8208;powered electromechanical stimulation of tendon tissue through piezo&#8208;bioelectric device results in ion channel modulation in vitro and regulates specific tissue regeneration signaling pathways. Finally, the potential of the piezo&#8208;bioelectronic device in modulating the progression of tendinopathy&#8208;associated processes in vivo, using a rat Achilles acute injury model is shown. This study indicates that electromechanical stimulation regulates mechanosensitive ion channel sensitivity and promotes tendon&#8208;specific over non&#8208;tenogenic tissue repair processes.

         <title>An Optogenetics&#8208;Inspired Flexible van der Waals Optoelectronic Synapse and its Application to a Convolutional Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide, which features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity effect, is proposed. Following in&#8208;depth analysis including density functional theory calculations on rhenium disulfide, its feasibility for hardware neural networks with learning ability is demonstrated using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapses.








Abstract
Optogenetics refers to a technique that uses light to modulate neuronal activity with a high spatiotemporal resolution, which enables the manipulation of learning and memory functions in the human brain. This strategy of controlling neuronal activity using light can be applied for the development of intelligent systems, including neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing systems. Herein, a flexible van der Waals (vdW) optoelectronic synapse is reported, which is a core component of optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems. This synapse is fabricated on 2D vdW layered rhenium disulfide (ReS2) that features an inherent photosensitive memory nature derived from the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect, successfully mimicking the dynamics of biological synapses. Based on first&#8208;principles calculations, the PPC effect is identified to originate from sulfur vacancies in ReS2 that have an inherent tendency to form shallow defect states near the conduction band edges and under optical excitation lead to large lattice relaxation. Finally, the feasibility of applying the synapses in optogenetics&#8208;inspired intelligent systems is demonstrated via training and inference tasks for the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset using a convolutional neural network composed of vdW optoelectronic synapse devices.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Monolayer YOx/MoOx on Ultrathin Pt Nanowires Boosts Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of sub&#8208;monolayer YOx/MoOx&#8208;surface&#8208;co&#8208;decorated ultrathin platinum (Pt) nanowires is demonstrated to effectively boost alcohol oxidation electrocatalysis. The surface Y and Mo atoms make the free energies of CO* and COOH* be decoupled on the nanowire surfaces, lowering the energy barriers for the oxidation CO* into COOH*.








Abstract
A crucial issue restricting the application of direct alcohol fuel cells (DAFCs) is the low activity of Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alcohol oxidation reaction caused by the reaction intermediate (CO*) poisoning. Herein, a new strategy is demonstrated for making a class of sub&#8208;monolayer YOx/MoOx&#8208;surface co&#8208;decorated ultrathin platinum nanowires (YOx/MoOx&#8211;Pt NWs) to effectively eliminate the CO poisoning for enhancing methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. By adjusting the amounts of YOx and MoOx decorated on the surface of ultrathin Pt NWs, the optimized 22% YOx/MoOx&#8211;Pt NWs achieve a high specific activity of 3.35&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a mass activity of 2.10 A mgPt&#8722;1, as well as the enhanced stability. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and CO stripping studies confirm the contribution of YOx and MoOx to anti&#8208;CO poisoning ability of the NWs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that the surface Y and Mo atoms with oxidation states allow COOH* to bind the surface through both the carbon and oxygen atoms, which can lower the free energy barriers for the oxidation of CO* into COOH*. The optimal NWs also show the superior activities toward the electro&#8208;oxidation of ethanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Jump Photodynamic Theranostics: MnO2 Combined Upconversion Nanoplatforms Involving a Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Characteristics for Potent Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;jump photodynamic theranostics protocol is explored for high&#8208;efficacy cancer treatment, by establishing an intelligent glutathione&#8208;depleting and NIR&#8208;regulated theranostic nanoplatform comprising a MnO2 nanoshell, upconversion nanoparticles, and aggregation&#8208;induced emission&#8208;active Type&#8208;I photosensitizers.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional nanoplatforms has been recognized as a promising strategy for potent photodynamic theranostics. Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers undergoing Type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation pathway appear as potential candidates due to their capability of hypoxia&#8208;tolerance, efficient ROS production, and fluorescence imaging navigation. To further improve their performance, a facile and universal method of constructing a type of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;depleting and near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;regulated nanoplatform for dual&#8208;modal imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is presented. The nanoplatforms are obtained through the coprecipitation process involving upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers, followed by in situ generation of MnO2 as the outer shell. The introduction of UCNPs actualizes the NIR&#8208;activation of AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers to produce &#183;OH as a Type&#8208;I ROS. Intracellular upregulated GSH&#8208;responsive decomposition of the MnO2 shell to Mn2+ realizes GSH&#8208;depletion, which is a distinctive approach for elevating intracellular &#183;OH. Meanwhile, the generated Mn2+ can implement T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in specific tumor sites, and mediate the conversion of intracellular H2O2 to &#183;OH. These outputs reveal a triple&#8208;jump &#183;OH production, and this approach brings about distinguished performance in FLI&#8208;MRI&#8208;guided PDT with high&#8208;efficacy, which presents great potential for future clinical translations.

         <title>Antibacterial Gel Coatings Inspired by the Cryptic Function of a Mussel Byssal Peptide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to its role in wet adhesion, it is discovered that a peptide (Mfp&#8208;529&#8208;47) derived from the foot pad of mussels exhibits cryptic antibacterial activity. This discovery inspires the design of antibacterial adhesive hydrogels that kill bacteria by two mechanisms: surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing. The lead material, MIKA2, inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium implants in mice.








Abstract
Although the adhesive and cohesive nature of mussel byssal proteins have long served to inspire the design of materials embodying these properties, their characteristic amino acid compositions suggest that they might also serve to inspire an unrelated material function not yet associated with this class of protein. Herein, it is demonstrated that a peptide derived from mussel foot protein&#8208;5, a key protein in mussel adhesion, displays antibacterial properties, a yet unreported activity. This cryptic function serves as inspiration for the design of a new class of peptide&#8208;based antibacterial adhesive hydrogels prepared via self&#8208;assembly, which are active against drug&#8208;resistant Gram&#8208;positive bacteria. The gels exert two mechanisms of action, surface&#8208;contact membrane disruption and oxidative killing affected by material&#8208;produced H2O2. Detailed studies relating amino acid composition and sequence to material mechanical adhesion/cohesion and antibacterial activity affords the MIKA2 adhesive gel, a material with a superior activity that is shown to inhibit colonization of titanium implants in mice.

         <title>Haptically Quantifying Young's Modulus of Soft Materials Using a Self&#8208;Locked Stretchable Strain Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology (termed LOCK) for simply and rapidly quantifying Young's modulus of soft materials is developed. The LOCK demonstrates a miniaturized and fully mobile fingertip modulus sensor, enabling Young's modulus measurements through a simple touch, independent of touch forces. The method is universal and adaptable to a broad range of fields for opening up new applications.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A new methodology (termed LOCK) for simply and rapidly quantifying Young's modulus of soft materials is developed. The LOCK demonstrates a miniaturized and fully mobile fingertip modulus sensor, enabling Young's modulus measurements through a simple touch, independent of touch forces. The method is universal and adaptable to a broad range of fields for opening up new applications.

         <title>Sweet Electronics: Honey&#8208;Gated Complementary Organic Transistors and Circuits Operating in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of edible electronics devices requires unconventional solutions, in particular, the use of functional food&#8208;based materials in the design. An inherently safe and nutritive compound, honey, is hereby proposed as an effective gating medium for the realization of air&#8208;stable complementary organic transistors and circuits operating at low voltage (&lt;1&#160;V) and featuring other distinctive electronic functionalities.








Abstract
Sustainable harnessing of natural resources is key moving toward a new&#8208;generation electronics, which features a unique combination of electronic functionality, low cost, and absence of environmental and health hazards. Within this framework, edible electronics, of which transistors and circuits are a fundamental component, is an emerging field, exploiting edible materials that can be safely ingested, and subsequently digested after performing their function. Dielectrics are a critical functional element of transistors, often constituting their major volume. Yet, to date, there are only scarce examples of electrolytic food&#8208;based materials able to provide low&#8208;voltage operation of transistors at ambient conditions. In this context, a cost&#8208;effective and edible substance, honey, is proposed to be used as an electrolytic gate viscous dielectric in electrolyte&#8208;gated organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). Both n&#8208; and p&#8208;type honey&#8208;gated OFETs (HGOFETs) are demonstrated, with distinctive features such as low voltage (&lt;1 V)&#160;operation, long&#8208;term shelf life and operation stability in air, and compatibility with large&#8208;area fabrication processes, such as inkjet printing on edible tattoo&#8208;paper. Such complementary devices enable robust honey&#8208;based integrated logic circuits, here exemplified by inverting logic gates and ring oscillators. A marked device responsivity to humidity provides promising opportunities for sensing applications, specifically, for moisture control of dried or dehydrated food.

         <title>A Supramolecular Antidote to Macromolecular Toxins Prepared through Coassembly of Macrocyclic Amphiphiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular detoxification is an emerging strategy for treating poisoning; however, developing supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins is challenging. To overcome this challenge, we&#160;develop a heteromultivalent coassembling material (CCA&#8208;CD) comprising macrocyclic amphiphiles. The CCA&#8208;CD binds with melittin strongly and selectively, and significantly alleviates its toxicity, serving as a novel supramolecular antidote used for melittin poisoning treatment.








Abstract
Poisoning is a leading cause of admission to medical emergency departments and intensive care units. Supramolecular detoxification, which involves injecting supramolecular receptors that bind with toxins to suppress their biological activity, is an emerging strategy for poisoning treatment; it has few requirements and a broad application scope. However, it is still a formidable challenge to design supramolecular therapeutic materials as an antidote to macromolecular toxins, because the large size, flexible conformation, and presence of multiple and diverse binding sites of biomacromolecules hinder their recognition. Herein, a supramolecular antidote to macromolecular toxins is developed through the coassembly of macrocyclic amphiphiles, relying on heteromultivalent recognition between the coassembled components and toxic macromolecules. The coassembly of amphiphilic cyclodextrin and calixarene strongly and selectively captures melittin, a toxin studied herein; this imparts various therapeutic effects such as inhibiting the interactions of melittin with cell membranes, alleviating melittin cytotoxicity and hemolytic toxicity, reducing the mortality rate of melittin&#8208;poisoned mice, and mitigating damage to major organs. The use of the proposed antidote overcomes the limitation of supramolecular detoxification applicability to only small&#8208;molecular toxins. The antidote can also detoxify other macromolecular toxins as long as selective and strong binding is achieved because of the coassembling tunability.

         <title>Reversible Dendritic&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Reinforced Polymer Gel for Bioinspired Adaptable Adhesive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystal&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced polymer gel adhesive is prepared by introducing room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network, realizing ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability. The adhesive ensures the high adhesion strength to the hard interface and excellent peeling toughness to soft biological tissues and can be adjusted via external stimuli, which achieves superior detachability and recycling performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength and reversible adhesion technology, which is a universal phenomenon in nature but remains challenging for artificial synthesis, is essential for the development of modern science. Existing adhesive designs without interface versatility hinder their application to arbitrary surfaces. Bioinspired by creeper suckers, a crystal&#8208;fiber reinforced polymer gel adhesive with ultrastrong adhesion strength and universal interface adaptability is creatively prepared via introducing a room&#8208;temperature crystallizable solvent into the polymer network. The gel adhesive formed by hydrogen bonding interaction between crystal fibers and polymer network can successfully realize over 9.82&#160;MPa reversible adhesion strength for rough interface and 406.87 J m&#8722;2 peeling toughness for skin tissue. In situ anchoring is achieved for adapting to different geometrical surfaces. The adhesion performance can be significantly improved with the further increase of the interfacial roughness and hydrophilicity, whose dissipation mechanism is simulated by finite element analysis. The melting&#8211;crystallization equilibrium of the crystal fibers is proved by synchrotron radiation scattering. Accordingly, reversible phase&#8208;transition triggered by light and heat can realize the controlled adhere&#8211;detach recycle. Later adjustments to the monomers or crystals are expected to broaden its applications to various fields such as bioelectronics, electronic processing, and machine handling.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely efficient ion&#8208;exchange doping process for conjugated polymers which enables conductivities exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated. Factors which affect ion exchange, such as electrolyte concentration, doping solvent, and film crystallinity are discussed. When exchange is efficient there is a direct correspondence between ion exchange electrochemical doping, which is used to reveal the detrimental impact of off&#8208;target oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Molecular doping&#8212;the use of redox&#8208;active small molecules as dopants for organic semiconductors&#8212;has seen a surge in research interest driven by emerging applications in sensing, bioelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox&#8208;active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was&#160;a doping technique based on ion&#8208;exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno(3,2&#8208;b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&#8722;1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.

An electrochemistry strategy to enable functional improvements of hydrogels is reported. In comparison with an untreated one, the mechanical strength can be improved by 7.37 times, the interfacial adhesion energy to 1400 J m&#8722;2, and the healing efficiency to 100%, showing a general feature for the rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have demonstrated great potential in biomedical and engineering areas. To improve the physical performance, development of efficient physical/chemical protocols is essential. Herein, an electrochemistry functionalization strategy that is capable of enabling the functional improvements of hydrogel is reported. The electrochemistry functionalization is demonstrated on a hydrogel model of polyacrylamide (PAAm)@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan. The electrochemistry reaction generates metal ions (Fe3+) that migrate and coordinate with the sulfate groups of &#954;&#8208;carrageenan resulting in the prominent function improvements. In comparison with untreated PAAm@&#954;&#8208;carrageenan hydrogel, it can improve the mechanical strength by 7.37 times, and can increase the interfacial adhesion energy of the hydrogel on a glass surface from 0 to 1400 J m&#8722;2, stronger than the bonding strength of tendons (adhesion energy: &#8776;800 J m&#8722;2). Two pieces of hydrogel strips integrate into an intact structure by the electrochemistry functionalization, where the healing efficiency reaches 100% in comparison to the untreated hydrogel. The most significant development is that it enables functional patterning on the hydrogel by the electrode assembly, which provides the hydrogel with modular sensitivity to external pressure. Therefore, it can be a general protocol for rapid generation of multifunctional hydrogels for biomedical and engineering developments.

         <title>Time&#8211;Temperature Integrating Optical Sensors Based on Gradient Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A colloidal stopband&#8208;based time&#8211;temperature integrator is introduced, which can monitor the thermal history of a specific system over an adjustable time and temperature range. The fabrication of a binary colloidal crystal gradient comprising same&#8208;sized, monodisperse particles with distinct glass transition temperatures are the key components for this type of integrating sensor.








Abstract
Manipulation&#8208;free and autonomous recording of temperature states for extended periods of time is of increasing importance for food spoilage and battery safety assessment. An optical readout is preferred for low&#8208;tech visual inspection. Here, a concept for time&#8211;temperature integrators based on colloidal crystals is introduced. Two unique features in this class of advanced materials are combined: 1) the film&#8208;formation kinetics can be controlled by orders of magnitude based on mixtures of particles with distinct glass transition temperatures. 2) A gradual variation of the particle mixture along a linear gradient of the colloidal crystal enables local readout. Tailor&#8208;made latex particles of identical size but different glass transition temperatures provide a homogenous photonic stopband. The disappearance of this opalescence is directly related to the local particle ratio and the exposure to a time and temperature combination. This sensing material can be adjusted to report extended intermediate and short excessive temperature events, which makes it specifically suitable for long&#8208;term tracing and threshold applications.

         <title>Reproducible X&#8208;ray Imaging with a Perovskite Nanocrystal Scintillator Embedded in a Transparent Amorphous Network Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, which features X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1). More importantly, the blurred X&#8208;ray images of the damaged perovskite NCs, due to irradiation at high dose rate, are well refreshed by a thermal treatment. This discovery broadens the research and application of the scintillators and opens a new chapter.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are emerging scintillator materials in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. However, the vulnerable structure of perovskites triggers unreliable performance when they are utilized in X&#8208;ray detectors under cumulative dose irradiation. Herein, a self&#8208;limited growth strategy is proposed to construct CsPbBr3 nanocrystals that are embedded in a transparent amorphous network structure, featuring X&#8208;imaging with excellent resolution (&#8776;16.8&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1), and fast decay time (&#964;&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ns). Interestingly, it is found that the performance degradation of the scintillator, caused by the damage from high&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray irradiation, can be fully recovered after a facile thermal treatment process. This indicates a superior recycling behavior of the explored perovskites scintillator for practical applications. The recoverability of the as&#8208;explored scintillator is attributed to the low atom&#8208;migration rate in the amorphous network with high&#8208;viscosity (1&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cP). This result highlights the practical settlement of the promising perovskites for long&#8208;term, cost&#8208;effective scintillator devices.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum from Self&#8208;Assembled Concentric Nanoparticle Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concentric rings of plasmonic nanoparticles are fabricated by self&#8208;assembling supramolecular nanocomposites on lithographically patterned surfaces. After assembly, the arrays of concentric rings generate high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Due to their unique ability to self&#8208;regulate the distribution of each building block, supramolecular nanocomposites are a robust assembly platform. In this work, they accommodate variations in pattern dimension, nanoparticle loading, and nanoparticle ring size.








Abstract
Ring&#8208;shaped nanostructures can focus, filter, and manipulate electromagnetic waves, but are challenging to incorporate into devices using standard nanofabrication techniques. Directed self&#8208;assembly (DSA) of block copolymers (BCPs) on lithographically patterned templates has successfully been used to fabricate concentric rings and spirals as etching masks. However, this method is limited by BCP phase behavior and material selection. Here, a straightforward approach to generate ring&#8208;shaped nanoparticle assemblies in thin films of supramolecular nanocomposites is demonstrated. DSA is used to guide the formation of concentric rings with radii spanning 150&#8211;1150&#160;nm and ring widths spanning 30&#8211;60&#160;nm. When plasmonic nanoparticles are used, ring nanodevice arrays can be fabricated in one step, and the completed devices produce high&#8208;quality orbital angular momentum (OAM). Nanocomposite DSA simplifies and streamlines nanofabrication by producing metal structures without etching or deposition steps; it also introduces interparticle coupling as a new design axis. Detailed analysis of the nanoparticle ring assemblies confirms that the supramolecular system self&#8208;regulates the spatial distribution of its components, and thus exhibits a degree of flexibility absent in DSA of BCPs alone, where structures are determined by polymer&#8208;pattern incommensurability. The present studies also provide guidelines for developing self&#8208;regulating DSA as an alternative to incommensurability&#8208;driven methods.

         <title>Manipulating the Local Coordination and Electronic Structures for Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived (oxy)hydroxide nanocage electrocatalysts are in situ generated by inheriting the structure of the pre&#8208;catalyst. The successful manipulation of the local coordination and electronic structures of the electrocatalyst enables superior electrocatalytic activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based nanomaterials can exhibit extraordinary electrocatalytic performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by harnessing the structural evolution during catalysis and the synergistic effect between elements. However, the structure of active centers in bimetallic/multimetallic catalysts is under long&#8208;time debate in the catalysis community. Here, an efficient bimetallic Ni&#8211;Fe selenide&#8208;derived OER electrocatalyst is reported and the structure&#8211;activity correlation during the OER evolution studied. By combining experiments and theoretical calculations,&#160;a conceptual advance is provided, in that the local coordination structure distortion and disordering of active sites inherited from the pre&#8208;catalyst and post&#8208;formed by a further reconstruction are responsible for boosting the OER performance. The active center is identified on Ni sites showing moderate bindings with oxygenous intermediates rather than Fe sites with strong and poisonous adsorptions. These findings provide crucial understanding in manipulating the local coordination and electronic structures toward rational design and fabrication of efficient OER electrocatalysts.

4,4&#8242;&#8208;Thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT) and its oligomers formed in situ in charging have large size, and therefore can be blocked by the nanosized ion&#8208;conducting clusters in sodiated Nafion membranes, leading to enhanced performance of sodium batteries. The Na|TBBT cell retains 77% of the theoretical capacity of TBBT after 300 cycles (2420 h). In addition, the Na|TBBT flow cell also shows promising rechargeability.








Abstract
Organosulfurs are promising cathode materials for rechargeable metal batteries due to their high capacities, diverse structures, and electrochemical properties. Herein, the electrochemical behavior of three organosulfur compounds, i.e., 4,4&#8242;&#8208;thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT), 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT), and diphenyl disulfide (DPDS), is revealed in room&#8208;temperature rechargeable sodium (Na) batteries, which show significantly improved performances when sodiated Nafion membranes are used. Large oligomers of organosulfur can be formed during charging, and they are readily blocked by the nanosized ion&#8208;conducting clusters in the Nafion membrane. In addition, large organosulfur monomers can also be blocked. Only 5.4% of TBBT diffuses through the Nafion membrane after 800 h. The Na|TBBT cell sustains 77% of the theoretical capacity after 300 cycles (2420 h). Moreover, the Na|TBBT redox flow cell shows promising rechargeability. Due to the medium molecular size, the organosulfur oligomers are expected to provide a new avenue to develop high&#8208;capacity chalcogen cathodes, besides inorganic S and S&#8208;containing polymers.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction and Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Switchable Topological Spin Texture in SrRuO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a chemical junction between oxygen&#8208;deficient and stoichiometric SrRuO3, a particularly strong interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction is induced, which stabilizes skyrmionic magnetic bubbles at the nanoscale and thus leads to a topological Hall effect. Moreover, such topological spin textures can be reversibly controlled through an electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable migration of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the topological Hall signal can be deterministically switched ON and OFF.








Abstract
In situ electrical control of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) is one of the central but challenging goals toward skyrmion&#8208;based device applications. An atomic design of defective interfaces in spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled transition&#8208;metal oxides can be an appealing strategy to achieve this goal. In this work, by utilizing the distinct formation energies and diffusion barriers of oxygen vacancies at SrRuO3/SrTiO3(001), a sharp interface is constructed between oxygen&#8208;deficient and stoichiometric SrRuO3. This interfacial inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking leads to a sizable DMI, which can induce skyrmionic magnetic bubbles and the topological Hall effect in a more than 10 unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick SrRuO3. This topological spin texture can be reversibly manipulated through the migration of oxygen vacancies under electric gating. In particular, the topological Hall signal can be deterministically switched ON and OFF. This result implies that the defect&#8208;engineered topological spin textures may offer an alternate perspective for future skyrmion&#8208;based memristor and synaptic devices.

         <title>3D Atomic&#8208;Scale Dynamics of Laser&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Restructuring of Nanoparticles Unraveled by Electron Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution electron tomography reveals atomic rearrangements in metal nanoparticles upon femtosecond laser excitation. Based on the measured 3D atomic structure, molecular dynamics simulations unravel the dynamics of the underlying process and give insight on how strain, crystal facet distribution, and surface diffusion govern these rearrangements.








Abstract
Understanding light&#8211;matter interactions in nanomaterials is crucial for optoelectronic, photonic, and plasmonic applications. Specifically, metal nanoparticles (NPs) strongly interact with light and can undergo shape transformations, fragmentation and ablation upon (pulsed) laser excitation. Despite being vital for technological applications, experimental insight into the underlying atomistic processes is still lacking due to the complexity of such measurements. Herein, atomic resolution electron tomography is performed on the same mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;coated gold nanorod, before and after femtosecond laser irradiation, to assess the missing information. Combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the experimentally determined 3D atomic&#8208;scale morphology, the complex atomistic rearrangements, causing shape deformations and defect generation, are unraveled. These rearrangements are simultaneously driven by surface diffusion, facet restructuring, and strain formation, and are influenced by subtleties in the atomic distribution at the&#160;surface.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Molecular&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Judicious Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetradentate Pd(II) complex, i.e., Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, exhibiting efficient aggregate emission is developed through judicious ligand design. The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode device using Pd3O8&#8208;Py5 aggregates exhibits a peak EQEair of 37.3% and a peak EQEair+sub of 67.4% with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a long measured LT95 lifetime (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of over 500 h with an initial brightness of 17&#160;304 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Phosphorescent molecular aggregates show promise in realizing efficient and stable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) operating at high brightness level, which is highly desired for future lighting and display applications. Herein, four tetradentate Pd(II) complexes are prepared with judicious ligand design, and their electrochemical and photophysical properties are thoroughly examined. The studies indicate that slight structural changes of ligands can modify the hole and electron transporting capabilities, and alter the horizontal emitting dipole ratios of aggregates in amorphous film, the latter of which are sensitive to the thin&#8208;film deposition conditions including the deposition rate and the choice of the templating layer. An optimized OLED device using Pd3O8&#8208;Py5 aggregates exhibits a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3% and a reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off with high EQEs of 36.0% and 32.5% at 1000 and 10&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, such an efficient device demonstrates a long measured LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) lifetime of over 500 h with an initial brightness of 17&#160;304&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 corresponding to an estimated LT95 lifetime of 48&#160;246 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Hydroxyapatite Nanorods Function as Safe and Effective Growth Factors Regulating Neural Differentiation and Neuron Development</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating the neural differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into mature neurons is attractive for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases using an NSC approach. With their slow&#8208;release and long&#8208;acting properties, hydroxyapatite nanorods promote the differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well&#8208;defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. It is superior to natural differentiation that requires 2 weeks.








Abstract
Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the slow spontaneous differentiation of NSCs often hampers their application in neural repair. Although some biological growth factors accelerate the differentiation of NSCs, their high cost, short half&#8208;life, and unpredictable behavior in vivo, as well as the complexity of the operation, hinder their clinical use. In this study, it is demonstrated that hydroxyapatite (HAp), the main component of bone, in the form of nanorods, can regulate the neural differentiation of NSCs and maturation of the newly differentiated cells. Culturing NSCs with HAp nanorods leads to the differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well&#8208;defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. The state of these neurons is much better than when culturing the cells without HAp nanorods, which undergo a 2&#8208;week differentiation process. Furthermore, RNA&#8208;sequencing data reveal that the neuroactive ligand&#8211;receptor interaction pathway is dominant in the enriched differentiated neuronal population. Hence, inorganic growth factors like HAp act as a feasible, effective, safe, and practical tool for regulating the differentiation of NSCs and can potentially be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

     alt="Hydroxyapatite Nanorods Function as Safe and Effective Growth Factors Regulating Neural Differentiation and Neuron Development"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerating the neural differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into mature neurons is attractive for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases using an NSC approach. With their slow-release and long-acting properties, hydroxyapatite nanorods promote the differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well-defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. It is superior to natural differentiation that requires 2 weeks.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the slow spontaneous differentiation of NSCs often hampers their application in neural repair. Although some biological growth factors accelerate the differentiation of NSCs, their high cost, short half-life, and unpredictable behavior in vivo, as well as the complexity of the operation, hinder their clinical use. In this study, it is demonstrated that hydroxyapatite (HAp), the main component of bone, in the form of nanorods, can regulate the neural differentiation of NSCs and maturation of the newly differentiated cells. Culturing NSCs with HAp nanorods leads to the differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well-defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. The state of these neurons is much better than when culturing the cells without HAp nanorods, which undergo a 2-week differentiation process. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing data reveal that the neuroactive ligand&#8211;receptor interaction pathway is dominant in the enriched differentiated neuronal population. Hence, inorganic growth factors like HAp act as a feasible, effective, safe, and practical tool for regulating the differentiation of NSCs and can potentially be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunable Structural Color Images by UV&#8208;Patterned Conducting Polymer Nanofilms on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV&#8208;light patterning method turns monochromic conducting polymers into multicolor images, using the UV dose to control structural coloration via both the film thickness and polymer permittivity. Electrochemical modulation of the conducting polymer redox states further enables dynamic tuning of the structurally colored images.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of light&#8211;matter interactions has enabled a wide variety of approaches to create bright and vivid structural colors. Techniques utilizing photonic crystals, Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities, plasmonics, or high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces have been studied for applications ranging from optical coatings to reflective displays. However, complicated fabrication procedures for sub&#8208;wavelength nanostructures, limited active areas, and inherent absence of tunability of these approaches impede their further development toward flexible, large&#8208;scale, and switchable devices compatible with facile and cost&#8208;effective production. Here, a novel method is presented to generate structural color images based on monochromic conducting polymer films prepared on metallic surfaces via vapor phase polymerization and ultraviolet (UV) light patterning. Varying the UV dose enables synergistic control of both nanoscale film thickness and polymer permittivity, which generates controllable structural colors from violet to red. Together with grayscale photomasks this enables facile fabrication of high&#8208;resolution structural color images. Dynamic tuning of colored surfaces and images via electrochemical modulation of the polymer redox state is further demonstrated. The simple structure, facile fabrication, wide color gamut, and dynamic color tuning make this concept competitive for applications like multifunctional displays.

         <title>Ultrathin Surface Coating of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Enables Stable Zinc Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett approach is used to construct an ultrathin and parallel nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene protective layer on zinc (Zn) foil. The artificial interfacial film regulates the directional deposition of metallic Zn and inhibits the side reactions, thus achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Owing to the high volumetric capacity and low redox potential, zinc (Zn) metal is considered to be a remarkably prospective anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, dendrite growth severely destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and accelerates the generation of side reactions, which eventually degrade the electrochemical performance. Here, an artificial interface film of nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped graphene oxide (NGO) is one&#8208;step synthesized by a Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett method to achieve a parallel and ultrathin interface modification layer (&#8776;120&#160;nm) on Zn foil. The directional deposition of Zn crystal in the (002) planes is revealed because of the parallel graphene layer and beneficial zincophilic&#8208;traits of the N&#8208;doped groups. Meanwhile, through the in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and in situ Raman tests, the directional plating morphology of metallic Zn at the interface effectively suppresses the hydrogen evolution reactions and passivation. Consequently, the pouch cells pairing this new anode with LiMn2O4 cathode maintain exceptional energy density (164&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 after 178 cycles) at a reasonable depth of discharge, 36%. This work provides an accessible synthesis method and in&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis to accelerate the application of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy AZIBs.

         <title>A Partial Sulfuration Strategy Derived Multi&#8208;Yolk&#8211;Shell Structure for Ultra&#8208;Stable K/Na/Li&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial sulfuration strategy is developed to fabricate a multi&#8208;yolk&#8211;shell structure for overcoming the barriers of high&#8208;capacity anodes. Integrating both the merits of the yolk&#8211;shell structure for good structural stability and the multiple connection points for fast ion/electron transportation, the as&#8208;designed composite delivers superior rate capability and long&#8208;term cyclability for K/Na/Li&#8208;ion storage, outperforming most reported yolk&#8211;shell structures and metal&#8208;sulfide&#8208;based anodes.








Abstract
Metal sulfides are attractive anodes for alkali metal ion batteries due to the high theoretical capacity, while their practical implementation is hampered by the inherent poor conductivity and vast volume variation during cycles. Approaching rational designed microstructures with good stability and fast charge transfer is of great importance in response to these issues. Herein, a partial sulfuration strategy for the rational construction of multi&#8208;yolk&#8211;shell (m&#8208;Y&#8211;S) structures, from which multiple Fe1&#8722;xS nanoparticles are confined within hollow carbon nanosheet with tunable interior void space is reported. As anode materials, the m&#8208;Y&#8211;S Fe1&#8722;xS@C composite can display high capacity and excellent rate capability (134, 365, and 447&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 for K+, Na+, and Li+ storage at 20 A g&#8722;1). Remarkably, it exhibits ultra&#8208;stable potassium storage up to 1200, 6000, and 20&#160;000 cycles under current densities of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 A g&#8722;1, which is much superior to previous yolk&#8211;shell structures and metal&#8208;sulfide anodes. Based on comprehensive experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, the exceptional performance of m&#8208;Y&#8211;S structure can be ascribed to the optimized interior void space for good structure stability, as well as the multiple connection points and conductive carbon layer for superior electron/ion transportation.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Doping and Synergism toward High&#8208;Performance Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh activity and selectivity seawater electrolyzer with robust stability is developed via a dual&#8208;doping and synergism optimization of Fe,P&#8208;NiSe2 nanoporous films. The Fe cation increases the selectivity and Faraday efficiency, while the P anion improves the electronic conductivity and prevents the dissolution of selenide.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) production from direct seawater electrolysis is an economically appealing yet fundamentally and technically challenging approach to harvest clean energy. The current seawater electrolysis technology is significantly hindered by the poor stability and low selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the competition with chlorine evolution reaction in practical application. Herein, iron and phosphor dual&#8208;doped nickel selenide nanoporous films (Fe,P&#8208;NiSe2 NFs) are rationally designed as bifunctional catalysts for high&#8208;efficiency direct seawater electrolysis. The doping of Fe cation increases the selectivity and Faraday efficiency (FE) of the OER. While the doping of P anions improves the electronic conductivity and prevents the dissolution of selenide by forming a passivation layer containing P&#8211;O species. The Fe&#8208;dopant is identified as the primary active site for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and meanwhile, stimulates the adjacent Ni atoms as active centers for the OER. The experimental analyses and theoretical calculations provide an insightful understanding of the roles of dual&#8208;dopants in boosting seawater electrolysis. As a result, a current density of 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is archived at 1.8 V with high OER selectivity and long&#8208;term stability for over 200 h, which surpasses the benchmarking platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals&#8208;free electrolyzers.

While the doping of P anions improves the electronic conductivity and prevents the dissolution of selenide by forming a passivation layer containing P&#8211;O species. The Fe-dopant is identified as the primary active site for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and meanwhile, stimulates the adjacent Ni atoms as active centers for the OER. The experimental analyses and theoretical calculations provide an insightful understanding of the roles of dual-dopants in boosting seawater electrolysis. As a result, a current density of 0.8 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is archived at 1.8 V with high OER selectivity and long-term stability for over 200 h, which surpasses the benchmarking platinum-group-metals-free electrolyzers.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Integrating Single Atoms with Different Microenvironments into One Porous Organic Polymer for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal sites with &#8211;N4 and &#8211;N2O2 coordination mode simultaneously incorporated into one porous organic backbone are reported. With the assistance of experimental results and theoretical calculations, the &#8211;N2O2 coordinated single metal sites are identified with higher catalytic activity toward CO2 photoreduction compared to that of traditional &#8211;N4 coordinated one.








Abstract
The precise identification of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) activity and boosting their efficiency toward CO2 conversion is imperative yet quite challenging. Herein, for the first time a series of porous organic polymers is designed and prepared simultaneously, containing well&#8208;defined M&#8211;N4 and M&#8211;N2O2 single&#8208;atom sites. Such a strategy not only offers multiactive sites to promote the catalytic efficiency but also provides a more direct chance to identify the metal center activity. The CO2 photoreduction results indicate that the introduction of salphen unit with Ni&#8211;N2O2 catalytic centers into pristine phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni&#8211;N4 framework achieves remarkable CO generation ability (7.77&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8211;1) with a high selectivity of 96% over H2. In combination with control experiments, as well as theoretical studies, the Ni&#8211;N2O2 moiety is evidenced as a more active site for CO2RR compared with the traditional Ni&#8211;N4 moiety, which can be ascribed to the M&#8211;N2O2 active sites effectively reducing the energy barrier, facilitating the adsorption of reaction radicals *COOH, and improving the charge transportation. This work might shed some light on designing more efficient SACs toward CO2 reduction through modification of their coordination environments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Picosecond Nanodiodes for Low&#8208;Power Ultrafast Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast electrical response down to record sub&#8208;picosecond with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.7&#160;V is demonstrated by developing a novel fabricated coplanar full&#8208;metal tip&#8208;to&#8208;edge nanostructure with an asymmetrical sub&#8208;10&#160;nm air channel, providing important implications to address a series of longstanding bottlenecks in continuously improved modern electronics.








Abstract
The tradeoff between ultrahigh speed and low power is a dominant challenge in continuously improving modern electronics. Fundamental electronic devices with ultrafast response are highly desired in low&#8208;power electronics. However, conventional semiconductor electronic devices now near the speed limit from the physical roadblocks including short&#8208;channel effect, restricted carrier velocity, and heat death. Currently emerging electronic devices also face formidable difficulties to achieve high&#8208;speed performance at low operating voltage without heat disturbance. Here, a novel fabricated coplanar tip&#8208;to&#8208;edge semiconductor&#8208;free nanostructure with asymmetric sub&#8208;10&#160;nm air channel is reported, stimulating electric&#8208;field accelerated scattering&#8208;free transport of electrons and resulting in ultrafast response of record sub&#8208;picoseconds at a low turn&#8208;on voltage around 0.7&#160;V. Simulation results show a typical electrical response down to 64 fs, which is &#8776;103 times faster than that of conventional semiconductor electronic devices. The coplanar asymmetric nanostructure allows a high rectifying ratio up to 106 which is superior to that of the most promising 2D semiconducting nanodiodes. In addition, heat death is overcome due to the inherent advantages from the novel nanostructure and underlying working mechanism. The intriguing nanodiodes will attract broadly interests in electronics due to their potential as rudimentary building blocks in ultrafast electronic integrated circuits.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 0D&#8211;2D Heterostructure Electrocatalyst from MOF and MXene for Boosted Lithium Polysulfide Conversion Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 0D&#8211;2D heterostructure electrocatalyst from a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) and MXene is proposed as a catalytic cathode for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The 0D CoZn&#8211;Se and 2D N&#8208;MXene co&#8208;catalysts form double lithiophilic&#8211;sulfiphilic binding sites, promote Li&#8208;ion diffusion, and reduce the energy barrier of Li2S deposition/dissolution. The catalytic cathode exhibits an ultralong cycle life and high area capacity under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.








Abstract
The design of nanostructured electrocatalysts with high activity and long&#8208;term durability for the sluggish lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion reaction is essential for the development of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of bimetallic selenides on nitrogen&#8208;doped MXene (CoZn&#8208;Se@N&#8208;MX) based on the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8211;organic framework and MXene is reported. A combination of 0D CoZn&#8208;Se nanoparticles and 2D N&#8208;MX nanosheet co&#8208;catalysts forms double lithiophilic&#8208;sulfifilic binding sites that effectively immobilize and catalytically convert LiPS intermediates. This 0D&#8211;2D heterostructure catalyst has a hierarchical porous architecture with a large active area and enables rapid Li ion diffusion, reduces the activation energy of Li2S deposition, and lowers the energy barrier of Li2S dissolution. In addition, an assembled CoZn&#8208;Se@N&#8208;MX hybrid synergistically prevents the aggregation of the CoZn&#8208;Se nanoparticles and restacking of the active areas of N&#8208;MX nanosheets during assembly and the LiPS conversion process. The Li&#8211;S battery with this 0D&#8211;2D catalyst delivers excellent rate capability, ultralong cycling life (over 2000 cycles), and a high areal capacity of 6.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering Microdomains of Oxides in High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Electrodes toward Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of bulk electrodes is designed by incorporating oxide microdomains into the so&#8208;called high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). From these, unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is&#160;achieved, with an ultralow overpotential of 196&#160;mV and a Tafel slope of 29&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and with stability longer than 120&#160;h in 1&#160;m KOH solution at current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
One important goal of the current electrocatalysis is to develop integrated electrodes from the atomic level design to multilevel structural engineering in simple ways and low prices. Here, a series of oxygen micro&#8208;alloyed high&#8208;entropy alloys (O&#8208;HEAs) is developed via a metallurgy approach. A (CrFeCoNi)97O3 bulk O&#8208;HEA shows exceptional electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching an overpotential as low as 196&#160;mV and a Tafel slope of 29&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and with stability longer than 120&#160;h in 1&#160;m KOH solution at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. It is shown that the enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the formation of island&#8208;like Cr2O3 microdomains, the leaching of Cr3+ ions, and structural amorphization at the interfaces of the domains. These findings offer a technological&#8208;orientated strategy to integrated electrodes.

Here, a series of oxygen micro-alloyed high-entropy alloys (O-HEAs) is developed via a metallurgy approach. A (CrFeCoNi)&lt;sub&gt;97&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bulk O-HEA shows exceptional electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching an overpotential as low as 196&#160;mV and a Tafel slope of 29&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and with stability longer than 120&#160;h in 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; KOH solution at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is shown that the enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the formation of island-like Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microdomains, the leaching of Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and structural amorphization at the interfaces of the domains. These findings offer a technological-orientated strategy to integrated electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Translation of Collagen Ultrastructure to Biomaterial Fabrication for Material&#8208;Independent but Highly Efficient Topographic Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen I fibrils are found to exhibit unprecedented topographic immunomodulatory effects on human macrophages equal in intensity to the established interleukin&#8208;4&#8208;based biochemical induction. Employing melt electrofibrillation, a printing technique that allows the fabrication of collagen&#8208;fibril&#8208;mimetic nanofibrillar microbundles, it is demonstrated that this strong immunomodulatory effect is purely topographic and can be translated to synthetic materials.








Abstract
Supplement&#8208;free induction of cellular differentiation and polarization solely through the topography of materials is an auspicious strategy but has so far significantly lagged behind the efficiency and intensity of media&#8208;supplementation&#8208;based protocols. Consistent with the idea that 3D&#160;structural motifs in the extracellular matrix possess immunomodulatory capacity as part of the natural healing process, it is found in this study that human&#8208;monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages show a strong M2a&#8208;like prohealing polarization when cultured on type I rat&#8208;tail collagen fibers but not on collagen I films. Therefore, it is hypothesized that highly aligned nanofibrils also of synthetic polymers, if packed into larger bundles in 3D topographical biomimetic similarity to native collagen I, would induce a localized macrophage polarization. For the automated fabrication of such bundles in a 3D printing manner, the strategy of &#8220;melt electrofibrillation&#8221; is pioneered by the integration of flow&#8208;directed polymer phase separation into melt electrowriting and subsequent selective dissolution of the matrix polymer postprocessing. This process yields nanofiber bundles with a remarkable structural similarity to native collagen I fibers, particularly for medical&#8208;grade poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone). These biomimetic fibrillar structures indeed induce a pronounced elongation of human&#8208;monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages and unprecedentedly trigger their M2&#8208;like polarization similar in efficacy as interleukin&#8208;4 treatment.

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase&#8208;Separated Systems from Reversible Gel&#8211;Sol Transition of Protein Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet microfluidics is facilitated to engineer liquid proteinaceous materials of controllable size and dispersity at the microscale, through all&#8208;aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The protein condensates are highlighted by their morphological evolution, fusion, and the diffusion of nano&#8208;/microspheres in the materials, which would have implications in temperature sensing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering for healthcare.








Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated biomolecular systems are increasingly recognized as key components in the intracellular milieu where they provide spatial organization to the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. The widespread use of phase&#8208;separated systems by nature has given rise to the inspiration of engineering such functional systems in the laboratory. In particular, reversible gelation of liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated systems could confer functional advantages to the generation of new soft materials. Such gelation processes of biomolecular condensates have been extensively studied due to their links with disease. However, the inverse process, the gel&#8211;sol transition, has been less explored. Here, a thermoresponsive gel&#8211;sol transition of an extracellular protein in microgel form is explored, resulting in an all&#8208;aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated system with high homogeneity. During this gel&#8211;sol transition, elongated gelatin microgels are demonstrated to be converted to a spherical geometry due to interfacial tension becoming the dominant energetic contribution as elasticity diminishes. The phase&#8208;separated system is&#160;further explored with respect to the diffusion of small particles for drug&#8208;release scenarios. Together, this all&#8208;aqueous system opens up a route toward size&#8208;tunable and monodisperse synthetic biomolecular condensates and controlled liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, offering possibilities for applications in bioengineering and biomedicine.

         <title>Highly Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Rubidium and Chlorine Alloyed Metal Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with external quantum efficiency reaching 10.1% and maximum luminance of 14&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 are realized by simultaneous incorporation of Rb+ and Cl&#8722; ions and long&#8208;chain ligands into CsPbBr3. The compositional engineering promotes the formation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with wide bandgap, and results in sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized particles on the film surface that enhance the light outcoupling.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are promising candidates for display and solid&#8208;state lighting, due to their tunable colors, high conversion efficiencies, and low cost. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs is far inferior to that of the near&#8208;infrared, red, and green counterparts. Here, the fabrication of pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with an emission peak at 475&#160;nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 10.1%, and a maximum luminance of 14&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is demonstrated by tailoring the compositions of perovskites. The pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence is achieved by simultaneous addition of rubidium and chlorine ions into CsPbBr3 and incorporation of phenylethylammonium chloride forms quasi&#8208;2D hybrid perovskites. The combination of these composition engineering results in blueshifted emissions without reducing the quantum yield. The judicious alloying is shown to be critical to result in the better morphology with suppressed current leakage and enhanced light outcoupling.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controlled Topological Magnetic Transformations in a Nanostructured Kagome Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current&#8208;controlled topological skyrmion&#8211;bubble and skyrmion&#8211;stripe transformations are achieved in a reversible and reproducible way by tuning the nanosecond pulsed current amplitude on the order of &#8776;1010 A m&#8722;2, which enables future reliable and energy&#8208;efficient manipulation of electromagnetic properties in topological spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic charge Q is a fundamental parameter that describes the magnetic domains and determines their intriguing electromagnetic properties. The ability to switch Q in a controlled way by electrical methods allows for flexible manipulation of electromagnetic behavior in future spintronic devices. Here, the room&#8208;temperature current&#8208;controlled topological magnetic transformations between Q&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 skyrmions and Q&#160;= 0 stripes or type&#8208;II bubbles in a kagome crystal Fe3Sn2 are reported. It is shown that reproducible and reversible skyrmion&#8211;bubble and skyrmion&#8211;stripe transformations can be achieved by tuning the density of nanosecond pulsed current of the order of &#8776;1010 A m&#8722;2. Further numerical simulations suggest that spin&#8208;transfer torque combined with Joule thermal heating effects determine the current&#8208;induced topological magnetic transformations.

         <title>A Biomimetic Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer with Antigen&#8208;Presenting and Hitchhiking Function for Lipid Droplet Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with antigen&#8208;presenting and hitchhiking abilities (DC@AIEdots) are presented by coating dendritic cell (DC) membranes on AIE nanoaggregates. The inner AIE molecules can selectively accumulate in tumor cells, and the outer cell membrane facilitates DC@AIEdots hitchhiking on endogenous T cells, enhancing tumor delivery efficiency and stimulating T cell proliferation and activation in vivo.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising alternative approach for effective cancer treatment that is associated with an antitumor immune response. However, immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment limits the immune response induced by PDT. Stimulation and proliferation of T cells is a critical step for generating immune responses and depends on the efficient presentation of tumor antigens and co&#8208;stimulatory molecules by antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs). Here, biomimetic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with antigen&#8208;presenting and hitchhiking abilities (DC@AIEdots) are developed by coating dendritic cell (DC) membranes on the nanoaggregates of the AIEgens. Notably, the inner AIE molecules can selectively accumulate in lipid droplets of tumor cells, and the outer cell membrane can facilitate the hitchhiking of DC@AIEdots onto the endogenous T cells and enhance the tumor delivery efficiency by about 1.6&#160;times. Furthermore, DC@AIEdots can stimulate the in vivo proliferation and activation of T cells and trigger the immune system. The potential applications of therapeutic agents targeting lipid droplets for immunotherapy are indicated and a new hitchhiking approach for drug delivery is provided. Lastly, the study presents a photoactive and artificial antigen&#8208;presenting platform for effective T cell stimulation and cancer photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Upconversion&#8208;and&#8208;Downshifting&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescent Switches in Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;regulated upconversion (UC)&#8208; and downshifting (DS)&#8208;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches are achieved by integrating chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks with luminescent diarylethenes and UC nanoparticles. UC&#8208;CPL exhibits a higher dissymmetry factor than that of DS&#8208;CPL, and a chiroptical logic circuit with 2D information output is fabricated based on this switch.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted tremendous attention for several novel applications. However, functional MOFs with light&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are not examined in detail. Therefore, a dual CPL switch exhibiting both upconversion (UC) and downshifting (DS) CPL in the solid state is constructed by loading a luminescent diarylethene derivative (DAEC) and UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) into chiral MOFs. The chiral MOF&#8835;DAEC composites exhibit both photoswitchable luminescence and DS&#8208;CPL properties under alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Additionally, a reversible UC&#8208;CPL switch is realized using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and visible light irradiation by introducing energy&#8208;level&#8208;matched UCNPs and DAEC into the chiral MOFs. The dissymmetry factor (glum) of UC&#8208;CPL is noted to be significantly amplified through energy transfer compared to that of DS&#8208;CPL, which indicates that the information on circular polarization can be manipulated by altering the incident light. A chiroptical logic circuit with a 2D information output is designed with UV, visible, and NIR light as inputs by setting a rational threshold.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Oriented Coupling Enables Fast and Sensitive Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve enhanced coupling from colloidal quantum dot (CQD) inks is introduced. By using colloidal atomic layer deposition, the surface of CQDs is reconstructed to facilitate coupling along the (100) facets and increase coupling. This increases the hole mobility by one order of magnitude and enables the fabrication of record&#8208;speed solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared photodiodes.








Abstract
Charge carrier transport in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solids is strongly influenced by coupling among CQDs. The shape of as&#8208;synthesized CQDs results in random orientational relationships among facets in CQD solids, and this limits the CQD coupling strength and the resultant performance of optoelectronic devices. Here, colloidal&#8208;phase reconstruction of CQD surfaces, which improves facet alignment in CQD solids, is reported. This strategy enables control over CQD faceting and allows demonstration of enhanced coupling in CQD solids. The approach utilizes post&#8208;synthetic resurfacing and unites surface passivation and colloidal stability with a propensity for dots to couple via (100):(100) facets, enabling increased hole mobility. Experimentally, the CQD solids exhibit a 10&#215; increase in measured hole mobility compared to control CQD solids, and enable photodiodes (PDs) exhibiting 70% external quantum efficiency (vs 45% for control devices) and specific detectivity, D*&#160;&gt;&#160;1012&#160;Jones, each at 1550&#160;nm. The photodetectors feature a 7&#160;ns response time for a 0.01&#160;mm2 area&#8212;the fastest reported for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared PDs.

         <title>T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Nanovesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles (TCNVs) are produced from activated CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapeutics. TCNVs exhibit inhibition of solid tumor growth through blocking immunosuppressive molecules in the tumor microenvironment, aiding in maintaining the cytotoxic T cells&#8217; antitumor activity. Moreover, TCNVs kill tumor cells directly. Therefore, TCNV offers an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy to overcome the solid tumor's immunosuppressive mechanisms.








Abstract
Although T&#8208;cell therapy is a remarkable breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy, the therapeutic efficacy is limited for solid tumors. A major cause of the low efficacy is T&#8208;cell exhaustion by immunosuppressive mechanisms of solid tumors, which are mainly mediated by programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and transforming growth factor&#8208;beta (TGF&#8208;&#946;). Herein, T&#8208;cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles (TCNVs) produced by the serial extrusion of cytotoxic T cells through membranes with micro&#8208;/nanosized pores that inhibit T&#8208;cell exhaustion and exhibit antitumoral activity maintained in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are presented. TCNVs, which have programmed cell death protein 1 and TGF&#8208;&#946; receptor on their surface, block PD&#8208;L1 on cancer cells and scavenge TGF&#8208;&#946; in the immunosuppressive TME, thereby preventing cytotoxic&#8208;T&#8208;cell exhaustion. In addition, TCNVs directly kill cancer cells via granzyme B delivery. TCNVs successfully suppress tumor growth in syngeneic&#8208;solid&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Taken together, TCNV offers an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy to overcome the tumor's immunosuppressive mechanisms.

Highly efficient organic solar cells are fabricated using a ternary approach, wherein a novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F is designed and incorporated into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F and BTP&#8208;eC9 are found to form a homogeneous mixed phase, which improves the molecular packing of both donor and acceptor materials, and optimizes the ternary blend morphology. A record&#8208;high efficiency of 18.66% is consequently achieved.








Abstract
The ternary strategy, introducing a third component into a binary blend, opens a simple and promising avenue to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The judicious selection of an appropriate third component, without sacrificing the photocurrent and voltage output of the OSC, is of significant importance in ternary devices. Herein, highly efficient OSCs fabricated using a ternary approach are demonstrated, wherein a novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F is designed and incorporated into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. The three components&#160;show complementary absorption&#160;spectra&#160;and cascade energy alignment. L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F and BTP&#8208;eC9 are found to form a homogeneous mixed phase, which improves the molecular packing of both the donor and acceptor materials, and optimizes the ternary blend morphology. Moreover, the addition of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F into the binary blend suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination, thus leading to a reduced voltage loss. Consequently, concurrent increases in open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current, and fill factor are realized, resulting in an unprecedented PCE of 18.66% (certified value of 18.2%), which represents the highest efficiency values reported for both single&#8208;junction and tandem OSCs so far.

         <title>S&#8208;Decorated Porous Ti3C2 MXene Combined with In Situ Forming Cu2Se as Effective Shuttling Interrupter in Na&#8211;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;decorated porous Ti3C2 MXene is used as effective selenium host, giving high capacity, rate capability, and long lifespan of Na&#8211;Se batteries. The S&#8208;decorated interfaces combined with in situ forming Cu2Se facilitate the immobilization and transformation of polyselenides and thus lead to efficient surface&#8208;dominated capacitive behavior.








Given natural abundance of Na and superior kinetics of Se, Na&#8211;Se batteries have attracted much attention but still face the problem of shuttling effect of soluble intermediates. The first&#8208;principle calculations reveal the S&#8208;decorated Ti3C2 exhibits increased binding energy to sodium polyselenides, suggesting a better capture and restriction on intermediates. The obtained Se@S&#8208;decorated porous Ti3C2 (Se@S&#8208;P&#8208;Ti3C2) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 765 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 (calculated based on Se), &#8776;1.2, 1.3, and 1.7 times of Se@porous Ti3C2 (Se@P&#8208;Ti3C2), Se@Ti3C2, and Se, respectively. It gives considerable capacity of 664 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1 and impressive cycling stability over 2300 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.003% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the S&#8208;modified porous Ti3C2, which provides effective immobilization toward polyselenides, makes full use of nanosized Se, and alleviates volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation. Additionally, in situ forming Cu2Se can generate Cu nanoparticles through discharge process and then transform polyselenides into solid&#8208;phase Cu2Se, further suppressing the shuttling effect. This work provides a practical strategy to immobilize and transform sodium polyselenides for high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life Na&#8211;Se batteries.

         <title>Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attractive Pickering emulsion gels (APEGs) are designed and developed by engineering interdroplet interactions at molecular scale, where telechelic polymers bridge neighboring particle&#8208;stabilized droplets via the electrostatic attraction, forming a bridged droplet network with shear&#8208;thinning properties. APEGs are ideal inks for 3D printing and can be employed as templates to prepare functional porous materials.








Abstract
Properties of emulsions highly depend on the interdroplet interactions and, thus, engineering interdroplet interactions at molecular scale are essential to achieve desired emulsion systems. Here, attractive Pickering emulsion gels (APEGs) are designed and prepared by bridging neighboring particle&#8208;stabilized droplets via telechelic polymers. In the APEGs, each telechelic molecule with two amino end groups can simultaneously bind to two carboxyl functionalized nanoparticles in two neighboring droplets, forming a bridged network. The APEG systems show typical shear&#8208;thinning behaviors and their viscoelastic properties are tunable by temperature, pH, and molecular weight of the telechelic polymers, making them ideal for direct 3D printing. The APEGs can be photopolymerized to prepare APEG&#8208;templated porous materials and their microstructures can be tailored to optimize their performances, making the APEG systems promising for a wide range of applications.

Spintronic Devices
Writing and erasing operations in promising skyrmion&#8208;bubble&#8208;based spintronic devices are expected to be achieved by electric&#8208;controlled skyrmion&#8211;bubble transformations. In article number 2101610, Jin Tang, Haifeng Du, and co&#8208;workers realize current&#8208;controlled topological skyrmion&#8211;bubble magnetic transformations in a reversible way by tuning the nanosecond pulsed current density on the order of 106 A cm&#8722;2.

Structural Color Images
In article number 2102451, Magnus P. Jonsson and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a new approach to produce dynamic structural colors with UV&#8208;patterned conducting polymers. The UV patterning controls the film thickness and polymer permittivity, and enables production of multicolor images with a single exposure step. Combined with the electrochemical tunability of the conducting polymer, these devices hold promise for next&#8208;generation multifunctional displays.

Neural Stem Cell Differentiation
In article number 2100895, Yuanhua Sang, Guogang Xing, Hong Liu, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that hydroxyapatite (HAp), the main component of bone, in the form of nanorods, can regulate the neural differentiation of neural stem cell (NSCs) and maturation of the newly differentiated cells. Culturing NSCs with HAp nanorods leads to the differentiation of the NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well&#8208;defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. Hence, a practical tool for regulating the differentiation of NSCs, which can potentially be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases is presented.

Skyrmionic Bubbles
In article number 2102525, Lingfei Wang, Jinxing Zhang, and co&#8208;workers report that, at the interface between the perovskite&#8208;structured SrTiO3(001) substrate and SrRuO3 thin film, the distinct chemical potentials make the oxygen vacancies preferentially diffuse from SrTiO3 to SrRuO3. This unidirectional oxygen&#8208;vacancy diffusion process can create a new interface between stoichiometric and oxygen&#8208;deficient SrRuO3 layers, and the resultant inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking can further trigger a vortex&#8208;like spin texture, namely, skyrmionic magnetic bubbles.

Phase Separation
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of protein in all&#8208;aqueous environment is thought to be related to functional and aberrant biology, and has the potential to conceptualize smart biomaterials. In article number 2008670, Tuomas P. J. Knowles and co&#8208;workers use protein microgel precursors to form liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated systems with size&#8208;adjustable and dispersity&#8208;tunable biomolecular condensates. The outcomes at water&#8211;water interfaces can shed light on the understanding of biophysics in relevant areas and inspire the applications in bioengineering and biomedicine.

         <title>Biocatalytic Nanomaterials: A New Pathway for Bacterial Disinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements toward developing biocatalytic nanomaterials (BCNs) as a new pathway for bacterial disinfection are systematically reviewed. The antibacterial mechanism, classification of BCNs, energy&#8208;conversion&#8208;triggered or augmented biocatalytic activities, and biofilms&#8217; eradication are thoroughly discussed. Besides, the challenges and prospects for biocatalytic disinfection are summarized. This review may offer abundant inspirations for designing new BCNs for combating bacteria/biofilms.








Abstract
Clinical treatment of pathogenic infection has emerged as a growing challenge in global public health. Such treatment is currently limited to antibiotics, but abuse of antibiotics have induced multidrug resistance and high fatality rates in anti&#8208;infection therapies. Thus, it is vital to develop alternative bactericidal agents to open novel disinfection pathways. Drawing inspiration from elements of the human immune system that show great potential for controlling pathogens or regulating cell apoptosis, the design of biocatalytic nanomaterials (BCNs) have provided unrivaled opportunities for future antibacterial therapies. More significantly, BCNs exhibit various superior properties to immune cells and natural enzymes, such as higher biocatalytic performance, extraordinary stability against harsh conditions, and scalable production. In this review, the most recent efforts toward developing BCN&#8208;based biomedical applications in combating bacterial infections are focused upon. BCNs&#8217; antibacterial mechanisms, the classification of BCNs, antibacterial activities that can be triggered or augmented by energy conversion, and the eradication of biofilms with BCNs are systematically introduced and discussed. The current challenges and prospects of BCNs for biocatalytic disinfection are also summarized. It is anticipated this review will provide new therapeutic insights into combating bacteria and biofilms and offer significant new inspiration for designing future biocatalytic nanomaterials.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Self&#8208;Healing Polymers and Devices for Extreme and Hostile Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by natural systems, a self&#8208;healing function provides exceptional advantages to enhance the robustness and stability of engineering materials, components, and devices. Self&#8208;healing in extreme or harsh environments, such as those in space, the deep ocean, and nuclear applications, are considered. The self&#8208;healing functions, operation mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Engineering materials and devices can be damaged during their service life as a result of mechanical fatigue, punctures, electrical breakdown, and electrochemical corrosion. This damage can lead to unexpected failure during operation, which requires regular inspection, repair, and replacement of the products, resulting in additional energy consumption and cost. During operation in challenging, extreme, or harsh environments, such as those encountered in high or low temperature, nuclear, offshore, space, and deep mining environments, the robustness and stability of materials and devices are extremely important. Over recent decades, significant effort has been invested into improving the robustness and stability of materials through either structural design, the introduction of new chemistry, or improved manufacturing processes. Inspired by natural systems, the creation of self&#8208;healing materials has the potential to overcome these challenges and provide a route to achieve dynamic repair during service. Current research on self&#8208;healing polymers remains in its infancy, and self&#8208;healing behavior under harsh and extreme conditions is a particularly untapped area of research. Here, the self&#8208;healing mechanisms and performance of materials under a variety of harsh environments are discussed. An overview of polymer&#8208;based devices developed for a range of challenging environments is provided, along with areas for future research.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission&#8208;Active Gels: Fabrications, Functions, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As emerging luminescent materials, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE)&#8208;active (AIE&#8208;active) gels integrate the characteristics of AIE with those of gels, which impart them with various distinctive and advantageous properties in addition to promising application potential. An overview of the progress of AIE&#8208;active gels in terms of their fabrication, functions, and applications is provided.








Abstract
Chromophores that exhibit aggregation&#8208;induced emission (i.e., aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens [AIEgens]) emit intense fluorescence in their aggregated states, but show negligible emission as discrete molecular species in solution due to the changes in restriction and freedom of intramolecular motions. As solvent&#8208;swollen quasi&#8208;solids with both a compact phase and a free space, gels enable manipulation of intramolecular motions. Thus, AIE&#8208;active gels have attracted significant interest owing to their various distinctive properties and promising application potential. Herein, a comprehensive overview of AIE&#8208;active gels is provided. The fabrication strategies employed are detailed, and the applications of AIEgens are summarized. In addition, the gel functions arising from the AIE moieties are revealed, along with their structure&#8211;property relationships. Furthermore, the applications of AIE&#8208;active gels in diverse areas are illustrated. Finally, ongoing challenges and potential means to address them are discussed, along with future perspectives on AIE&#8208;active gels, with the overall aim of inspiring research on novel materials and ideas.

         <title>Recent Progress in Proximity Coupling of Magnetism to Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magnetic proximity effect in topological insulator&#8211;magnetic materials heterostructures is a promising strategy to optimize new topological phases with potential applications in low&#8208;energy electronics. Progress in this field is summarized with an introduction to the underlying physical mechanisms, a review of emerging material systems for magnetic proximity in topological insulators, and the status and prospects for obtaining new topological phases.








Abstract
Inducing long&#8208;range magnetic order in 3D topological insulators can gap the Dirac&#8208;like metallic surface states, leading to exotic new phases such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect or the axion insulator state. These magnetic topological phases can host robust, dissipationless charge and spin currents or unique magnetoelectric behavior, which can be exploited in low&#8208;energy electronics and spintronics applications. Although several different strategies have been successfully implemented to realize these states, to date these phenomena have been confined to temperatures below a few Kelvin. This review focuses on one strategy: inducing magnetic order in topological insulators by proximity of magnetic materials, which has the capability for room temperature operation, unlocking the potential of magnetic topological phases for applications. The unique advantages of this strategy, the important physical mechanisms facilitating magnetic proximity effect, and the recent progress to achieve, understand, and harness proximity&#8208;coupled magnetic order in topological insulators are discussed. Some emerging new phenomena and applications enabled by proximity coupling of magnetism and topological materials, such as skyrmions and the topological Hall effect, are also highlighted, and the authors conclude with an outlook on remaining challenges and opportunities in the&#160;field.

         <title>Comprehensive Understanding of the Thriving Ambient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ammonia represents the blood of industry; and agriculture, crop growth, green energy fuels, and industry production are inseparable from it. The electrochemical synthesis of ammonia is expected to replace the harsh and environmentally unfriendly Harber&#8211;Bosch process. A timely and comprehensive review of the booming ambient electrochemical ammonia synthesis is presented to promote its rapid and healthy development.








Abstract
The electrochemical method of combining N2 and H2O to produce ammonia (i.e., the electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction [E&#8208;NRR]) continues to draw attention as it is both environmentally friendly and well suited for a progressively distributed farm economy. Despite the multitude of recent works on the E&#8208;NRR, further progress in this field faces a bottleneck. On the one hand, despite the extensive exploration and trial&#8208;and&#8208;error evaluation of E&#8208;NRR catalysts, no study has stood out to become the stage protagonist. On the other hand, the current level of ammonia production (microgram&#8208;scale) is an almost insurmountable obstacle for its qualitative and quantitative determination, hindering the discrimination between true activity and contamination. Herein i) the popular theory and mechanism of the NRR are introduced; ii) a comprehensive summary of the recent progress in the field of the E&#8208;NRR and related catalysts is provided; iii) the operational procedures of the E&#8208;NRR are addressed, including the acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions; iv) the guiding principles and standardized recommendations for the E&#8208;NRR are emphasized and future research directions and prospects are provided.

         <title>Photoelectrochemical Water&#8208;Splitting Using CuO&#8208;Based Electrodes for Hydrogen Production: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 33, August 19, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoelectrochemical water&#8208;splitting method using CuO&#8208;based materials as high&#8208;efficiency photoelectrodes has potential to solve the global energy and environmental problems simultaneously. The usage of appropriate synthesis methods, modifying the CuO crystal structure and creating suitable conditions to increase the specific surface area can dramatically separate the electron&#8211;hole pairs and improve the photocurrent density of photoelectrodes.








Abstract
The cost&#8208;effective, robust, and efficient electrocatalysts for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water&#8208;splitting has been extensively studied over the past decade to address a solution for the energy crisis. The interesting physicochemical properties of CuO have introduced this promising photocathodic material among the few photocatalysts with a narrow bandgap. This photocatalyst has a high activity for the PEC hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under simulated sunlight irradiation. Here, the recent advancements of CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes, including undoped CuO, doped CuO, and CuO composites, in the PEC water&#8208;splitting field, are comprehensively studied. Moreover, the synthesis methods, characterization, and fundamental factors of each classification are discussed in detail. Apart from the exclusive characteristics of CuO&#8208;based photoelectrodes, the PEC properties of CuO/2D materials, as groups of the growing nanocomposites in photocurrent&#8208;generating devices, are discussed in separate sections. Regarding the particular attention paid to the CuO heterostructure photocathodes, the PEC water splitting application is reviewed and the properties of each group such as electronic structures, defects, bandgap, and hierarchical structures are critically assessed.

         <title>Ultrathin and Ultrasensitive Direct X&#8208;ray Detector Based on Heterojunction Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin and ultrasensitive direct X&#8208;ray detector based on a heterojunction phototransistor is developed by taking advantage of high&#8208;gain and gating&#8208;modulation mechanisms. This unique device concept allows for a significant reduction in X&#8208;ray photoconductor thickness while maintaining high sensitivity and low detection limit, which opens up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;resolution, flexible, and low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray direct detectors.








Abstract
Most contemporary X&#8208;ray detectors adopt device structures with non/low&#8208;gain energy conversion, such that a fairly thick X&#8208;ray photoconductor or scintillator is required to generate sufficient X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charges, and thus numerous merits for thin devices, such as mechanical flexibility and high spatial resolution, have to be compromised. This dilemma is overcome by adopting a new high&#8208;gain device concept of a heterojunction X&#8208;ray phototransistor. In contrast to conventional detectors, X&#8208;ray phototransistors allow both electrical gating and photodoping for effective carrier&#8208;density modulation, leading to high photoconductive gain and low noise. As a result, ultrahigh sensitivities of over 105&#160;&#956;C Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with low detection limit are achieved by just using an &#8776;50 nm thin photoconductor. The employment of ultrathin photoconductors also endows the detectors with superior flexibility and high imaging resolution. This concept offers great promise in realizing well&#8208;balanced detection performance, mechanical flexibility, integration, and cost for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Unveiling the Stabilities of Nickel&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes at an Identical Degree of Delithiation in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive insights into the stabilities of the LiNi1&#8722;x&#8211;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathode family on the basis of the degrees of delithiation are reported. It is revealed that NMC cathodes with higher Ni content may suggest better overall stabilities under an identical degree of delithiation, which contrasts with the common belief that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents have inherently reduced stabilities.








Abstract
Bulk, surface, and interfacial instabilities that impact the cycle and thermal performances are the major challenges with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LiNi1&#8722;x&#8211;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathodes with high nickel contents. It is generally believed that the instabilities and performance losses become exponentially aggravated as the nickel content increases. Disparate from this prevailing belief, it is herein demonstrated that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents may imply better overall stability than &#8220;lower&#8208;Ni&#8221; cathodes under an identical degree of delithiation (charging) conditions. With two representative cathodes, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiNiO2, a systematic investigation into their stabilities with control of the degree of delithiation is presented. Electrochemical tests indicate that LiNiO2 displays better cyclability than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 at the same delithiation state. Comprehensive structural and interphase investigations unveil that the inferior cyclability of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 predominantly results from aggravated parasitic reactions, and the interphase stability may be more critical than lattice stability in dictating cyclability. Also, LiNiO2 delivers similar or better thermal behavior than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The findings demonstrate a strong correlation of the stability of NMC cathodes to the degree of delithiation state rather than the Ni content itself, highlighting the importance of reassessing the true implications of Ni content and structural and interphasial tuning on the stabilities of NMC cathodes.

         <title>Organic Non&#8208;Wettable Superhydrophobic Fullerite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solubility and wettability of solids signify their interaction with liquids. The findings on fullerites&#8212;the only soluble form of pure carbon&#8212;are presented. It is demonstrated that solution&#8208;cast fullerite films developed from colloidal gels generate a non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic surface. They can be used directly in a plethora of practical applications requiring ultra&#8208;hydrophobicity and underwater photochemical applications.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing quest in material science has been the development of non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films based on a single organic material, without the requirement of fluorination or silane treatment. Here, such films and coatings, which are developed using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70 nanocrystals, are described. It is illustrated that despite the high surface energy of these van der Waals molecular crystals their gelation can create films having self&#8208;affine fractal surfaces with multiscale roughness. Water droplets on resulting surfaces of fullerite films bead like a pearl resting in a Fakir state with contact angle exceeding 150&#176;. The films are extremely water repellent and non&#8208;wettable; when submerged in water they stay dry up to 3 h even at a water depth of two feet and exhibit the plastron effect. A series of experiments are presented to provide comprehensive inspection of water droplet dynamics on these films. These include rolling, bouncing, squeezing, freezing, melting, evaporating; along with acidic and alkaline tests. Non&#8208;wettable films of such materials are unique as fullerites get photosensitized instantaneously generating extremely high yields (&#8776;100%) of singlet oxygen (1O2) that can destroy viruses and bacteria; thereby enabling their use in rheology, water purification, and medicinal devices.

Non-wettable films of such materials are unique as fullerites get photosensitized instantaneously generating extremely high yields (&#8776;100%) of singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) that can destroy viruses and bacteria; thereby enabling their use in rheology, water purification, and medicinal devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Intrinsically Micro&#8208;/Nanostructured Pollen Substrate with Tunable Optical Properties for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Naturally abundant, spiky pollen grains provide a versatile building block to fabricate flexible, photonically active substrates by taking advantage of intrinsic micro&#8208;/nanostructural properties that influence light&#8211;matter interactions. A pollen substrate can exhibit high transparency and haze in a tunable manner, and such capabilities can be readily utilized to incorporate pollen substrates into solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
There is broad interest in developing photonically active substrates from naturally abundant, minimally processed materials that can help to overcome the environmental challenges of synthetic plastic substrates while also gaining inspiration from biological design principles. To date, most efforts have focused on rationally engineering the micro&#8208; and nanoscale structural properties of cellulose&#8208;based materials by tuning fibril and fiber dimensions and packing along with chemical modifications, while there is largely untapped potential to design photonically active substrates from other classes of natural materials with distinct morphological features. Herein, the fabrication of a flexible pollen&#8208;derived substrate is reported, which exhibits high transparency (&gt;92%) and high haze (&gt;84%) on account of the micro&#8208; and nanostructure properties of constituent pollen particles that are readily obtained from nature and require minimal extraction or processing to form the paper&#8208;like substrate based on colloidal self&#8208;assembly. Experiments and simulations confirm that the optical properties of the pollen substrate are tunable and arise from light&#8211;matter interactions with the spiky surface of pollen particles. In a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the pollen substrate is incorporated into a functional perovskite solar cell while the tunable optical properties of the intrinsically micro&#8208;/nanostructured pollen substrate can be useful for a wide range of optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Superior All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by a Gas&#8208;Phase&#8208;Synthesized Sulfide Electrolyte with Ultrahigh Moisture Stability and Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel one&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase method is introduced to synthesize sulfide electrolyte from oxides in ambient air, making the synthesis process air&#8208;stable and glovebox&#8208;free. The as&#8208;synthesized Li3.875Sn0.875As0.125S4 possesses the highest ionic conductivity among all reported moist&#8208;air&#8208;stable sulfides, promoting potential mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries with high reversible capacity (188.4 mAh g&#8722;1) and long cycle life (210 cycles).








Abstract
Sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) are recognized as one of the most promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), due to their superior ionic conductivity and remarkable&#160;ductility. However, poor air stability, complex synthesis process, low yield, and high production cost obstruct the large&#8208;scale application of sulfide SEs. Herein, a one&#8208;step gas&#8208;phase synthesis method for sulfide SEs with oxide raw materials in ambient air, completely getting rid of the glovebox and thus making large&#8208;scale production possible, is reported. By adjusting substituted elements and concentrations, the ionic conductivity of Li4&#8208;xSn1&#8208;xMxS4 can reach 2.45&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, which represents the highest value among all reported moist&#8208;air&#8208;stable and recoverable lithium&#8208;ion sulfide SEs reported. Furthermore, ASSBs with air/water&#8208;exposed and moderate&#8208;temperature&#8208;treated Li3.875Sn0.875As0.125S4 even maintains superior performances with the highest reversible capacity (188.4 mAh g&#8722;1) and the longest cycle life (210&#160;cycles), which also breaks the record. Therefore, it may become one of the most critical breakthroughs during the development of sulfide ASSBs toward its practical application and commercialization.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction for 2D Materials: Application in Noble Metal/TiB2 Heterointerfaces and their Enhanced Catalytic Performance for Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) between noble metal nanoparticles and TiB2 is directly observed. The resulting catalysts are not only sintering&#8208;resistant up to 800 &#176;C, but also highly efficient for formic acid dehydrogenation. Theoretical studies suggest that the TiB2 overlayers are stabilized on different transition metals through an interplay between covalent and electrostatic interactions.








Abstract
Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is a phenomenon commonly observed on heterogeneous catalysts. Here, direct evidence of SMSI between noble metal and 2D TiB2 supports is reported. The temperature&#8208;induced TiB2 overlayers encapsulate the metal nanoparticles, resulting in core&#8211;shell nanostructures that are sintering&#8208;resistant with metal loadings as high as 12.0 wt%. The TiOx&#8208;terminated TiB2 surfaces are the active sites catalyzing the dehydrogenation of formic acid at room temperature. In contrast to the trade&#8208;off between stability and activity in conventional SMSI, TiB2&#8208;based SMSI promotes catalytic activity and stability simultaneously. By optimizing the thickness and coverage of the overlayer, the Pt/TiB2 catalyst displays an outstanding hydrogen productivity of 13.8&#160;mmol g&#8722;1cat h&#8722;1 in 10.0 m aqueous solution without any additive or pH adjustment, with &gt;99.9%&#160;selectivity toward CO2 and H2. Theoretical studies suggest that the TiB2 overlayers are stabilized on different transition metals through an interplay between covalent and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, the computationally determined trends in metal&#8211;TiB2 interactions are fully consistent with the experimental observations regarding the extent of SMSI on different transition metals. The present research introduces a new means to create thermally stable and catalytically active metal/support interfaces for scalable chemical and energy applications.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary Engineering of Monolayer MoS2 for Energy&#8208;Efficient Lateral Synaptic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
With lithography&#8208;free, direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing&#8208;controlled MoS2/MoS2&#8722;xO&#948; grain boundaries, synaptic devices exhibit short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously, as well as low energy consumption that is over 40 times lower than that of conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) devices.








Abstract
Synaptic devices based on 2D&#8208;layered materials have emerged as high&#8208;efficiency electronic synapses and neurons for neuromorphic computing. Lateral 2D synaptic devices have the advantages of multiple functionalities by responding to diverse stimuli, but they consume large amounts of energy, far more than the human brain. Moreover, current lateral devices employ several mechanisms based on conductive filaments and grain boundaries (GBs), but their formation is random and difficult to control, also hindering their practical applications. Here, four&#8208;terminal, lateral synaptic devices with artificially engineered GBs are reported, which are made from monolayer MoS2. With lithography&#8208;free, direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing&#8208;controlled MoS2/MoS2&#8722;xO&#948; GBs, such synaptic devices exhibit short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously. This enables detailed simulations of biological learning and cognitive processes as well as image perception and processing. In particular, the device exhibits low energy consumption, similar to that of the human brain and much lower than those of other lateral 2D synaptic devices. This work provides an effective way to fabricate lateral synaptic devices for practical application development and sheds light on controllable electrical state switching for neuromorphic computing.

Moreover, current lateral devices employ several mechanisms based on conductive filaments and grain boundaries (GBs), but their formation is random and difficult to control, also hindering their practical applications. Here, four-terminal, lateral synaptic devices with artificially engineered GBs are reported, which are made from monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. With lithography-free, direct-laser-writing-controlled MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; GBs, such synaptic devices exhibit short-term and long-term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously. This enables detailed simulations of biological learning and cognitive processes as well as image perception and processing. In particular, the device exhibits low energy consumption, similar to that of the human brain and much lower than those of other lateral 2D synaptic devices. This work provides an effective way to fabricate lateral synaptic devices for practical application development and sheds light on controllable electrical state switching for neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Innovative Solvent&#8208;Responsive Coiling&#8211;Expanding Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose&#8208;based vascular stent, which can realize self&#8208;expansion for supporting vessels by blood, is constructed. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of the as&#8208;prepared stent are systemically investigated. In addition, theoretical modeling for the as&#8208;prepared stent is conducted. The results reveal that the achieved vascular stent can make outstanding contributions in the tissue engineering.








Abstract
Coronary artery disease is the &#8220;first killer&#8221; in the world, while the classical treatment for this disease is to implant stent. An ideal vascular stent should be nontoxic with self&#8208;expanding characteristics, quick expanding speed, and appropriate mechanical supporting property. However, no existing vascular stent covers all properties. Herein, a two&#8208;way shape&#8208;memory cellulose vascular stent, which can realize shape adjustments by mild solutions such as water and alcohol, is constructed. The shape&#8208;memory characteristics, mechanical properties, cell toxicity, and biocompatibility, are systemically investigated by ex vivo experiment as well as molecule simulation and theoretical modeling, revealing that the achieved bilayer two&#8208;way shape&#8208;memory films (BSMFs) can be used as an artificial vascular stent. In particular, this vascular stent made from BSMFs shows superb biocompatibility according to live/dead cell viability assays. Ex vivo experiments reveal that the novel vascular stent can support arteria coronaria sinistra, or the left main coronary artery, at the opening state while the cross&#8208;section of the vessel becomes two times larger than that of the initial state after implantation. Thus, it is believed that effective and scalable BSMFs can make meritorious fundamental contributions to biomaterials science and practical applications such as vascular stents.

         <title>Nanoscale Noncollinear Spin Textures in Thin Films of a D2d Heusler Compound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncollinear magnetic nano&#8208;objects are observed in epitaxial thin films of the D2d Heusler compound Mn2RhSn using magnetic force microscopy. The nano&#8208;objects are stabilized over a wide temperature&#8208;field region and can be deleted or created by local magnetic fields, thereby paving a path toward the realization of skyrmionic devices based on D2d Heusler thin films.








Abstract
Magnetic nano&#8208;objects, namely antiskyrmions and Bloch skyrmions, have been found to coexist in single&#8208;crystalline lamellae formed from bulk crystals of inverse tetragonal Heusler compounds with D2d symmetry. Here evidence is shown for magnetic nano&#8208;objects in epitaxial thin films of Mn2RhSn formed by magnetron sputtering. These nano&#8208;objects exhibit a wide range of sizes with stability with respect to magnetic field and temperature that is similar to single&#8208;crystalline lamellae. However, the nano&#8208;objects do not form well&#8208;defined arrays, nor is any evidence found for helical spin textures. This is speculated to likely be a consequence of the poorer homogeneity of chemical ordering in the thin films. However, evidence is found for elliptically distorted nano&#8208;objects along perpendicular crystallographic directions within the epitaxial films, which is consistent with elliptical Bloch skyrmions observed in single&#8208;crystalline lamellae. Thus, these measurements provide strong evidence for the formation of noncollinear spin textures in thin films of Mn2RhSn. Using these films, it is shown that individual nano&#8208;objects can be deleted using a local magnetic field from a magnetic tip and collections of nano&#8208;objects can be similarly written. These observations suggest a path toward the use of these objects in thin films with D2d symmetry as magnetic memory elements.

         <title>Geometric Modulation of Local CO Flux in Ag@Cu2O Nanoreactors for Steering the CO2RR Pathway toward High&#8208;Efficacy Methane Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique category of CO2RR catalysts with a yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu2O shell that resembles a tandem nanoreactor, is fabricated. The shell envelope size can be finely tuned to regulate the CO flux arriving at the oxide&#8208;derived Cu shell, which further modulates *CO coverage and *H adsorption, consequently steering the electrocatalytic CO2RR pathway.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to CH4 stands as one of the promising paths for resourceful CO2 utilization in meeting the imminent &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; goal of the near future. Yet, limited success has been witnessed in the development of high&#8208;efficiency catalysts imparting satisfactory methane selectivity at a commercially viable current density. Herein, a unique category of CO2RR catalysts is fabricated with the yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu2O shell that resembles the tandem nanoreactor. By fixing the Ag core and tuning the Cu2O envelope size, the CO flux arriving at the oxide&#8208;derived Cu shell can be regulated, which further modulates the *CO coverage and *H adsorption at the Cu surface, consequently steering the CO2RR pathway. Density functional theory simulations show that lower CO coverage favors methane formation via stabilizing the intermediate *CHO. As a result, the best catalyst in the flow cell shows a high CH4 Faraday efficiency of 74 &#177; 2% and partial current density of 178 &#177; 5 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.2 VRHE, ranking above the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts reported today for methane production. These findings mark the significance of precision synthesis in tailoring the catalyst geometry for achieving desired CO2RR performance.

         <title>Highly Efficient Far&#8208;Red/NIR&#8208;Absorbing Neutral Ir(III) Complex Micelles for Potent Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing neutral Ir(III) complex (BODIPY&#8208;Ir) bearing the distyryl boron dipyrromethene motif and its encapsulated micelles (Micelle&#8208;Ir) are reported for potent photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) against aggressive tumors. Micelle&#8208;Ir demonstrates a remarkable therapeutic efficacy against primary breast and metastatic lung tumors through bifunctional PDT/PTT damage in a cooperative manner.








Abstract
A critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is inadequate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in tumors, causing inevitable survival of tumor cells that usually results in tumor recurrence and metastasis. Existing photosensitizers frequently suffer from relatively low light&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion efficiency with far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation due to low&#8208;lying excited states that lead to rapid non&#8208;radiative decays. Here, a neutral Ir(III) complex bearing distyryl boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY&#8208;Ir) is reported to efficiently produce both ROS and hyperthermia upon far&#8208;red light activation for potentiating in vivo tumor suppression through micellization of BODIPY&#8208;Ir to form &#8220;Micelle&#8208;Ir&#8221;. BODIPY&#8208;Ir absorbs strongly at 550&#8211;750&#160;nm with a band maximum at 685&#160;nm, and possesses a long&#8208;lived triplet excited state with sufficient non&#8208;radiative decays. Upon micellization, BODIPY&#8208;Ir forms J&#8208;type aggregates within Micelle&#8208;Ir, which boosts both singlet oxygen generation and the photothermal effect through the high molar extinction coefficient and amplification of light&#8208;to&#8208;ROS/heat conversion, causing severe cell apoptosis. Bifunctional Micelle&#8208;Ir that accumulates in tumors completely destroys orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors via synergistic PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) damage under light irradiation, and enables remarkable suppression of metastatic nodules in the lungs, together without significant dark cytotoxicity. The present study offers an emerging approach to develop far&#8208;red/NIR photosensitizers toward potent cancer therapy.

BODIPY-Ir absorbs strongly at 550&#8211;750&#160;nm with a band maximum at 685&#160;nm, and possesses a long-lived triplet excited state with sufficient non-radiative decays. Upon micellization, BODIPY-Ir forms &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-type aggregates within Micelle-Ir, which boosts both singlet oxygen generation and the photothermal effect through the high molar extinction coefficient and amplification of light-to-ROS/heat conversion, causing severe cell apoptosis. Bifunctional Micelle-Ir that accumulates in tumors completely destroys orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors via synergistic PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) damage under light irradiation, and enables remarkable suppression of metastatic nodules in the lungs, together without significant dark cytotoxicity. The present study offers an emerging approach to develop far-red/NIR photosensitizers toward potent cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Effective Piezo&#8208;Phototronic Enhancement of Flexible Photodetectors Based on 2D Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric Single&#8208;Crystalline Thin&#8208;Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective piezo&#8208;phototronic enhancement of flexible photodetectors based on ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films is demonstrated. Under external strains, the responsivity of the photodetectors can be enhanced by as much as 284%. These findings shed light on the piezo&#8208;phototronic effect for optimizing the performance of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices, and offer a promising avenue to broaden functionalities of hybrid perovskites.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are very attractive for optoelectronic applications because of their numerous exceptional properties. The emerging 2D perovskite ferroelectrics, in which are the coupling of spontaneous polarization and piezoelectric effects, as well as photoexcitation and semiconductor behaviors, have great appeal in the field of piezo&#8208;phototronics that enable to effectively improve the performance of optoelectronic devices via modulating the electro&#8208;optical processes. However, current studies on 2D perovskite ferroelectrics focus on bulk ceramics that cannot endure irregular mechanical deformation and limit their application in flexible optoelectronics and piezo&#8208;phototronics. Herein, we synthesize ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films (SCFs) for integration into flexible photodetectors. The in&#8208;plane multiaxial ferroelectricity is evident within the EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs through systematic characterizations. Flexible photodetectors based on EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs are achieved with an impressive photodetection performance. More importantly, optoelectronic EA4Pb3Br10 SCFs incorporated with in&#8208;plane ferroelectric polarization and effective piezoelectric coefficient show great promise for the observation of piezo&#8208;phototronic effect, which is capable of greatly enhancing the photodetector performance. Under external strains, the responsivity of the flexible photodetectors can be modulated by piezo&#8208;phototronic effect with a remarkable enhancement up to 284%. Our findings shed light on the piezo&#8208;phototronic devices and offer a promising avenue to broaden functionalities of hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics.

         <title>Germanium Nanosheets with Dirac Characteristics as a Saturable Absorber for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge nanosheets with &#8730;3 &#215;&#160;&#8730;3 germanene as the top layer are successfully grown on a Ag (111) substrate. Dirac characteristics, ultrafast carrier dynamics, and large nonlinear absorption coefficient are experimentally observed from the Ge nanosheets, which are further applied as new saturable absorbers to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized.








Abstract
Bulk germanium as a group&#8208;IV photonic material has been widely studied due to its relatively large refractive index and broadband and low propagation loss from near&#8208;infrared to mid&#8208;infrared. Inspired by the research of graphene, the 2D counterpart of bulk germanium, germanene, has been discovered and the characteristics of Dirac electrons have been observed. However, the optical properties of germanene still remain elusive. In this work, several layers of germanene are prepared with Dirac electronic characteristics and its morphology, band structure, carrier dynamics, and nonlinear optical properties are systematically investigated. It is surprisingly found that germanene has a fast carrier&#8208;relaxation time comparable to that of graphene and a relatively large nonlinear absorption coefficient, which is an order of magnitude higher than that of graphene in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these findings, germanene is applied as a new saturable absorber to construct an ultrafast mode&#8208;locked laser, and sub&#8208;picosecond pulse generation in the telecommunication band is realized. The results suggest that germanene can be used as a new type of group&#8208;IV material for various nonlinear optics and photonic applications.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field Tunable Intertwined Checkerboard Charge Order and Nematicity in the Surface Layer of Sr2RuO4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using ultralow temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, the low&#8208;energy electronic structure of the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 is revealed. Small structural distortions lead to radically different properties compared to the bulk with multiple van Hove singularities close to the Fermi energy giving rise to nematic and charge orders. The van Hove singularities can be manipulated by a magnetic field.








Abstract
In strongly correlated electron materials, the electronic, spin, and charge degrees of freedom are closely intertwined. This often leads to the stabilization of emergent orders that are highly sensitive to external physical stimuli promising opportunities for technological applications. In perovskite ruthenates, this sensitivity manifests in dramatic changes of the physical properties with subtle structural details of the RuO6 octahedra, stabilizing enigmatic correlated ground states, from a hotly debated superconducting state via electronic nematicity and metamagnetic quantum criticality to ferromagnetism. Here, it is demonstrated that the rotation of the RuO6 octahedra in the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 generates new emergent orders not observed in the bulk material. Through atomic&#8208;scale spectroscopic characterization of the low&#8208;energy electronic states, four van Hove singularities are identified in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. The singularities can be directly linked to intertwined nematic and checkerboard charge order. Tuning of one of these van Hove singularities by magnetic field is demonstrated, suggesting that the surface layer undergoes a Lifshitz transition at a magnetic field of &#8776;32T. The results establish the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 as an exciting 2D correlated electron system and highlight the opportunities for engineering the low&#8208;energy electronic states in these&#160;systems.

         <title>Multifunctional Conjugated Ligand Engineering for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the challenges in perovskite solar cells is passivating the perovskite surface without hindering charge extraction. In this work, a conjugated ligand is introduced to the interface between perovskite and hole&#8208;transporting layer, showing efficient hole extraction with improved energy level alignment and suppressed phase segregation. Therefore, devices with high efficiency and stability are achieved.








Abstract
Surface passivation is an effective way to boost the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, a key challenge faced by most of the passivation strategies is reducing the interface charge recombination without imposing energy barriers to charge extraction. Here, a novel multifunctional semiconducting organic ammonium cationic interface modifier inserted between the light&#8208;harvesting perovskite film and the hole&#8208;transporting layer is reported. It is shown that the conjugated cations can directly extract holes from perovskite efficiently, and simultaneously reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination. Together with improved energy level alignment and the stabilized interface in the device, a triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide medium&#8208;bandgap PSC with an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.06% (improved from 19.94%) and suppressed ion migration and halide phase segregation, which lead to a long&#8208;term operational stability, is demonstrated. This strategy provides a new practical method of interface engineering in PSCs toward improved efficiency and stability.

         <title>Intrinsic Electron Localization of Metastable MoS2 Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable MoS2 with intrinsic electron localization is demonstrated as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for the nitrogen reduction reaction. The NH3 yield rate and the Faradaic efficiency of metastable 1T&#8243;&#8242; MoS2 are about 9 and 12 times than those of 2H MoS2, correspondingly. This work develops a new class of non&#8208;noble materials catalysts for nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
The advancement of efficient electrocatalysts toward the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is critical in sustainable ammonia synthesis under ambient pressure and temperature. Manipulating the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts is particularly vital to form metal&#8211;nitrogen (M&#63743;N) bonds during the NRR through regulating the active electronic states of sites. Here, in sharp contrast to stable 2H MoS2 without metal chains, Mo&#63743;Mo bonding in metastable polymorphs of MoS2 bulk (zigzag chain in the 1T&#8242; phase and diamond chain in the 1T&#8243;&#8242; phase) is discovered to significantly increase intrinsic electron localization around the metal chains. This can enhance the charge transfer from the adsorbed nitrogen molecule to the metal chains, allowing for boosted NRR kinetics. The electrochemical experiments show that the NH3 yield rate and the faradaic efficiency of the metastable 1T&#8243;&#8242; MoS2 rich with abundant Mo&#8211;Mo bonds are about 9 and 12 times above average than those of 2H MoS2, correspondingly. Theoretical simulations reveal the high local electron density surrounding the Mo&#63743;Mo chains and sites can promote &#960; back&#8208;donation, which is beneficial for increasing nitrogen adsorption, strengthening the M&#63743;N bonds, and reducing the cleavage barrier of the triple N&#63741;N bond.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Based Free&#8208;Standing Proton&#8208;Conducting Transparent Elastomer for Large&#8208;Scale Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serum albumin is used as an affordable raw material for the creation of a transparent polymer using a green chemistry one&#8208;pot process, having attractive protonic&#8208;conductivity (5 mS cm&#8722;1) and elastic properties. The resulting polymer is cheap with a price&#8208;tag of $0.01 per cm2, and it is used as a solid&#8208;state flexible platform for physio&#8208;electric sensing.








Abstract
A most important endeavor in modern materials&#8217; research is the current shift toward green environmental and sustainable materials. Natural resources are one of the attractive building blocks for making environmentally friendly materials. In most cases, however, the performance of nature&#8208;derived materials is inferior to the performance of carefully designed synthetic materials. This is especially true for conductive polymers, which is the topic here. Inspired by the natural role of proteins in mediating protons, their utilization in the creation of a free&#8208;standing transparent polymer with a highly elastic nature and proton conductivity comparable to that of synthetic polymers, is demonstrated. Importantly, the polymerization process relies on natural protein crosslinkers and is spontaneous and energy&#8208;efficient. The protein used, bovine serum albumin, is one of the most affordable proteins, resulting in the ability to create large&#8208;scale materials at a low cost. Due to the inherent biodegradability and biocompatibility of the elastomer, it is promising for biomedical applications. Here, its immediate utilization as a solid&#8208;state interface for sensing of electrophysiological signals, is shown.

         <title>&#8220;Manipulation&#8221; of Crystal Structure by Methylthiolation Enabling Ultrahigh Mobility in a Pyrene&#8208;Based Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylthiolation is a simple but powerful way to control the crystal structures and thus the transport properties of molecular semiconductors; the sandwich herringbone structure of pyrene is altered into a new type of brickwork structure in 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene), which turns out to be an excellent molecular semiconductor showing ultrahigh mobility and band&#8208;like transport in the single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Control and prediction of crystal structures of molecular semiconductors are considered challenging, yet they are crucial for rational design of superior molecular semiconductors. It is here reported that through methylthiolation, one can rationally control the crystal structure of pyrene derivatives as molecular semiconductors; 1,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)pyrene keeps a similar sandwich herringbone structure to that of parent pyrene, whereas 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) takes a new type of brickwork structure. Such changes in these crystal structures are explained by the alteration of intermolecular interactions that are efficiently controlled by methylthiolation. Single crystals of MT&#8208;pyrene are evaluated as the active semiconducting material in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;FETs), which show extremely high mobility (32 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 on average) operating at the drain and gate voltages of &#8722;5&#160;V. Moreover, the band&#8208;like transport and very low trap density are experimentally confirmed for the MT&#8208;pyrene SC&#8208;FETs, testifying that the MT&#8208;pyrene is among the best molecular semiconductors for the SC&#8208;FET devices.

         <title>Vortex&#8208;Oriented Ferroelectric Domains in SnTe/PbTe Monolayer Lateral Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
SnTe/PbTe monolayer lateral heterostructures are experimentally created through a two&#8208;step molecular beam epitaxial growth process. A vortex&#8208;oriented quadrant ferroelectric domain configuration is observed in the van der Waals 2D material heterostructure in this work.








Abstract
Heterostructures formed from interfaces between materials with complementary properties often display unconventional physics. Of especial interest are heterostructures formed with ferroelectric materials. These are mostly formed by combining thin layers in vertical stacks. Here the first in situ molecular beam epitaxial growth and scanning tunneling microscopy characterization of atomically sharp lateral heterostructures between a ferroelectric SnTe monolayer and a paraelectric PbTe monolayer are reported. The bias voltage dependence of the apparent heights of SnTe and PbTe monolayers, which are closely related to the type&#8208;II band alignment of the heterostructure, is investigated. Remarkably, it is discovered that the ferroelectric domains in the SnTe surrounding a PbTe core form either clockwise or counterclockwise vortex&#8208;oriented quadrant configurations. In addition, when there is a finite angle between the polarization and the interface, the perpendicular component of the polarization always points from SnTe to PbTe. Supported by first&#8208;principles calculation, the mechanism of vortex formation and preferred polarization direction is identified in the interaction between the polarization, the space charge, and the strain effect at the horizontal heterointerface. The studies bring the application of 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenides on in&#8208;plane ferroelectric heterostructures a step closer.

         <title>Electrostatically Tunable Near&#8208;Infrared Plasmonic Resonances in Solution&#8208;Processed Atomically Thin NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin NbSe2 shows near&#8208;infrared plasmonic resonance that is thickness&#8208;dependant and can be in situ modulated by an electrostatic voltage applied through an ion gel. These results demonstrate a new strategy to access electrostatically tunable near&#8208;infrared plasmonic sources.








Abstract
In the broad spectral range, near&#8208;infrared (NIR) plasmonics find applications in telecommunication, energy harvesting, sensing, and more, all of which would benefit from an electrostatically controllable NIR plasmon source. However, it is difficult to control bulk NIR plasmonics directly with electrostatics because of the strong electric&#8208;field screening effect and high carrier concentration required to support NIR plasmons. Here, this constraint is overcome and the observation of NIR plasmonic resonances that can be modulated electrostatically over a range of &#8776;360 cm&#8211;1 in few&#8208;layer NbSe2 gratings is reported, thanks to the enhanced electrostatics of atomically thin 2D materials and the high&#8208;quality film produced by a solution method. NbSe2 plasmons also render strong field confinement due to their atomic thickness and provide an extra degree of resonance frequency modulation from the layered structure. This study identifies metallic 2D materials as promising (easily produced and well&#8208;performing) candidates to extend electrostatically tunable plasmonics to the technologically important NIR range.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin NbSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shows near-infrared plasmonic resonance that is thickness-dependant and can be in situ modulated by an electrostatic voltage applied through an ion gel. These results demonstrate a new strategy to access electrostatically tunable near-infrared plasmonic sources.

Two narrow&#8208;bandgap block copolymers PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6 are designed and synthesized for single&#8208;component polymer solar cells, and a record&#8208;high efficiency of 8.64% is obtained. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit relatively small energy loss and improved storage stability under both ambient condition and continued 80 &#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h.








Abstract
Two narrow&#8208;bandgap block conjugated polymers with a (D1&#8211;A1)&#8211;(D2&#8211;A2) backbone architecture, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6, are designed and synthesized for single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs). Both polymers contain same donor polymer, PBDB&#8208;T, but different polymerized nonfullerene molecule acceptors. Compared to all previously reported materials for SCOSCs, PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PIDIC2T and PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PTY6 exhibit narrower bandgap for better light harvesting. When incorporated into SCOSCs, the short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) is significantly improved to over 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.64%. Moreover, these block copolymers exhibit low energy loss due to high charge transfer (CT) states (Ect) plus small non&#8208;radiative loss (0.26&#160;eV), and improved stability under both ambient condition and continuous 80&#160;&#176;C thermal stresses for over 1000 h. Determination of the charge carrier dynamics and film morphology in these SCOSCs reveals increased carrier recombination, relative to binary bulk&#8208;heterojunction devices, which is mainly due to reduced ordering of both donor and acceptor fragments. The close structural relationship between block polymers and their binary counterparts also provides an excellent framework to explore further molecular features that impact the photovoltaic performance and boost the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiency of SCOSCs.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Triggered Self&#8208;Unpacking Capsule Containing Zwitterionic Hydrogel&#8208;Coated MOF Nanoparticles for Efficient Oral Exendin&#8208;4 Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;triggered self&#8208;unpacking capsule encapsulating zwitterionic hydrogel&#8208;coated metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles is developed for efficient oral exendin&#8208;4 delivery. The capsules are rapidly unpacked in the intestinal environment, driving the rapid release of the nanovehicles. The zwitterionic hydrogel layer improves both mucus penetration and internalization by the intestinal epithelial cells of the nanoparticles, leading to markedly enhanced pharmacological availability of exendin&#8208;4.








Abstract
Oral peptide or protein delivery is considered a revolutionary alternative to daily subcutaneous injection; however, major challenges remain in terms of impediments of the gastrointestinal environment and the intestinal epithelium consisting of mucus and the epithelial cell layer, leading to low bioavailability. To protect against gastrointestinal degradation and promote penetration across the intestinal mucosa, a pH&#8208;triggered self&#8208;unpacking capsule encapsulating zwitterionic hydrogel&#8208;coated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles is engineered. The MOF nanoparticles possess a high exendin&#8208;4 loading capacity, and the zwitterionic hydrogel layer imparts unique capability of permeation across the mucus layer and effective internalization by epithelial cells to the nano&#8208;vehicles. In addition to the gastro&#8208;resistant feature, the pH&#8208;responsive capsules are dissociated drastically in the intestinal environment due to the rapid generation of abundant CO2 bubbles, which triggers a sudden release of the nanoparticles. After oral administration of the capsules containing exendin&#8208;4&#8208;loaded nanoparticles into a diabetes rat model, markedly enhanced plasma exendin&#8208;4 levels are achieved for over 8 h, leading to significantly increased endogenous insulin secretion and a remarkable hypoglycemic effect with a relative pharmacological availability of 17.3%. Owing to the low risk of hypoglycemia, this oral exendin&#8208;4 strategy will provide a vast potential for daily and facile diabetes treatment.

         <title>Tetrafluoroborate&#8208;Induced Reduction in Defect Density in Hybrid Perovskites through Halide Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface treatment of MAPbI3 through methylammonium tetrafluoroborate (MABF4) leads to reduced non&#8208;radiative charge&#8208;carrier recombination with a reduction in first&#8208;order recombination rate by an order of magnitude. Solid&#8208;state NMR is used to elucidate the atomic&#8208;level mechanism of the BF4&#8722;&#8208;additive&#8208;induced improvements, revealing that it can act as a scavenger of excess methylammonium iodide (MAI).








Abstract
Hybrid&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices are demonstrating unprecedented growth in performance, and defect passivation approaches are highly promising routes to further improve properties. Here, the effect of the molecular ion BF4&#8722;, introduced via methylammonium tetrafluoroborate (MABF4) in a surface treatment for MAPbI3 perovskite, is reported. Optical spectroscopy characterization shows that the introduction of tetrafluoroborate leads to reduced non&#8208;radiative charge&#8208;carrier recombination with a reduction in first&#8208;order recombination rate from 6.5 &#215; 106 to 2.5 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1 in BF4&#8722;&#8208;treated samples, and a consequent increase in photoluminescence quantum yield by an order of magnitude (from 0.5 to 10.4%). 19F, 11B, and 14N solid&#8208;state NMR is used to elucidate the atomic&#8208;level mechanism of the BF4&#8722; additive&#8208;induced improvements, revealing that the BF4&#8722; acts as a scavenger of excess MAI by forming MAI&#8211;MABF4 cocrystals. This shifts the equilibrium of iodide concentration in the perovskite phase, thereby reducing the concentration of interstitial iodide defects that act as deep traps and non&#8208;radiative recombination centers. These collective results allow us to elucidate the microscopic mechanism of action of BF4&#8722;.

A nanomaterial&#8208;based optical modulation of excitable cells is demonstrated using biocompatible polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles as photothermal transducers. In the presence of PDA nanoparticles, neural spiking activity and cardiomyocyte beating rate are reversibly and controllably modulated by applying a near&#8208;IR laser with different power densities. The 3D collagen/PDA foam adds extra capabilities to this neuromodulation platform by localizing the photothermal effect.








Abstract
Advances in the design and synthesis of nanomaterials with desired biophysicochemical properties can be harnessed to develop non&#8208;invasive neuromodulation technologies. Here, the reversible modulation of the electrical activity of neurons and cardiomyocytes is demonstrated using polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles as photothermal nanotransducers. In addition to their broad light absorption and excellent photothermal activity, PDA nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and biodegradable, making them excellent candidates for both in vitro and in vivo applications. The modulation of the activity (i.e., spike rate of the neurons and beating rate of cardiomyocytes) of excitable cells can be finely controlled by varying the excitation power density and irradiation duration. Under optimal conditions, reversible suppression (&#8776;100%) of neural activity and reversible enhancement (two&#8208;fold) in the beating rate of cardiomyocytes is demonstrated. To improve the ease of interfacing of photothermal transducers with these excitable cells and enable spatial localization of the photothermal stimulus, a collagen/PDA nanoparticle foam is realized, which can be used as an &#8220;add&#8208;on patch&#8221; for photothermal stimulation. The non&#8208;genetic optical neuromodulation approach using biocompatible and biodegradable nanoparticles represents a minimally invasive method for controlling the activity of excitable cells with potential applications in nano&#8208;neuroscience and engineering.

Photodetectors
In article number 2101263, Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers report the use of ferroelectric EA4Pb3Br10 single&#8208;crystalline thin&#8208;films to broaden perovskite photodetection applications with piezo&#8208;phototronic effect enhanced behavior. The coupling of ferroelectric spontaneous polarization and the piezoelectric effect, as well as photoexcitation and semiconductor behaviors endow the EA4Pb3Br10&#8208;based flexible photodetectors with a strain&#8208;modulated capability, giving rise to an effective enhancement of photodetection performance via the piezo&#8208;phototronic effect.

Sr2RuO4 Surface Layers
As reported by Peter Wahl and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100593, small structural distortions in the surface layer of Sr2RuO4 create a system with radically different properties compared to the bulk, giving rise to multiple van Hove singularities and nematic and checkerboard charge orders. The image shows the structure of the van Hove singularity in reflection from the checkerboard order and nematicity, which are both required to understand the new exciting physics.

Superhydrophobic Surfaces
In article number 2102108, Debashis Chanda and co&#8208;workers report organic superhydrophobic surfaces created using colloidal gels of fullerite C60 and C70. Non&#8208;wettable superhydrophobic films and coatings developed using such semiconducting photosensitizer materials can be exploited in many applications. Furthermore, fullerite films are superaerophilic in an aqueous environment and can stay dry for up to 3 h even at a water depth of 60 cm.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coupling light&#8208;harvesting ability and catalytic function, plasmonic Cu serves as a promising platform for photocatalysis. Recent advancements of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic photocatalysis are systematically summarized, including their design and synthetic strategies, photocatalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding. In addition, approaches for the enhancement of light&#8208;utilization efficiency and construction of active centers on Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts are highlighted and discussed.








Abstract
With the capability of inducing intense electromagnetic field, energetic charge carriers, and photothermal effect, plasmonic metals provide a unique opportunity for efficient light utilization and chemical transformation. Earth&#8208;abundant low&#8208;cost Cu possesses intense and tunable localized surface plasmon resonance from ultraviolet&#8208;visible to near infrared region. Moreover, Cu essentially exhibits remarkable catalytic performance toward various reactions owing to its intriguing physical and chemical properties. Coupling with light&#8208;harvesting ability and catalytic function, plasmonic Cu serves as a promising platform for efficient light&#8208;driven chemical reaction. Herein, recent advancements of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic photocatalysis are systematically summarized, including designing and synthetic strategies for Cu&#8208;based catalysts, plasmonic catalytic performance, and mechanistic understanding over Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts. What's more, approaches for the enhancement of light utilization efficiency and construction of active centers on Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysts are highlighted and discussed in detail, such as morphology and size control, regulation of electronic structure, defect and strain engineering, etc. Remaining challenges and future perspectives for further development of Cu&#8208;based plasmonic catalysis are also proposed.

         <title>Electroactive Biomaterials and Systems for Cell Fate Determination and Tissue Regeneration: Design and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity is provided, along with recent progress in the study of electroactive biomaterials and systems, and their mediated electrostimulation in tissue regeneration.








Abstract
During natural tissue regeneration, tissue microenvironment and stem cell niche including cell&#8211;cell interaction, soluble factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) provide a train of biochemical and biophysical cues for modulation of cell behaviors and tissue functions. Design of functional biomaterials to mimic the tissue/cell microenvironment have great potentials for tissue regeneration applications. Recently, electroactive biomaterials have drawn increasing attentions not only as scaffolds for cell adhesion and structural support, but also as modulators to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and function, especially for electrically excitable cells and tissues. More importantly, electrostimulation can further modulate a myriad of biological processes, from cell cycle, migration, proliferation and differentiation to neural conduction, muscle contraction, embryogenesis, and tissue regeneration. In this review, endogenous bioelectricity and piezoelectricity are introduced. Then, design rationale of electroactive biomaterials is discussed for imitating dynamic cell microenvironment, as well as their mediated electrostimulation and the applying pathways. Recent advances in electroactive biomaterials are systematically overviewed for modulation of stem cell fate and tissue regeneration, mainly including nerve regeneration, bone tissue engineering, and cardiac tissue engineering. Finally, the significance for simulating the native tissue microenvironment is emphasized and the open challenges and future perspectives of electroactive biomaterials are concluded.

         <title>Comprehensive Understandings into Complete Reconstruction of Precatalysts: Synthesis, Applications, and Characterizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive understanding into complete reconstruction of precatalysts is summarized, mainly including its fundamental understandings, advantages, and features of completely reconstructed catalysts, design principles/strategies, extensive electrocatalysis applications, and advanced characterizations. This review is expected to arouse attention on the complete reconstruction materials for multifunctional applications in energy storage and conversion.








Abstract
Reconstruction induced by external environment (such as applied voltage bias and test electrolytes) changes catalyst component and catalytic behaviors. Investigations of complete reconstruction in energy conversion recently receive intensive attention, which promote the targeted design of top&#8208;performance materials with maximum component utilization and good stability. However, the advantages of complete reconstruction, its design strategies, and extensive applications have not achieved the profound understandings and summaries it deserves. Here, this review systematically summarizes several important advances in complete reconstruction for the first time, which includes 1) fundamental understandings of complete reconstruction, the characteristics and advantages of completely reconstructed catalysts, and their design principles, 2) types of reconstruction&#8208;involved precatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis in wide pH solution, and origins of limited reconstruction degree as well as design strategies/principles toward complete reconstruction, 3) complete reconstruction for novel material synthesis and other electrocatalysis fields, and 4) advanced in situ/operando or multiangle/level characterization techniques to capture the dynamic reconstruction processes and real catalytic contributors. Finally, the existing major challenges and unexplored/unsolved issues on studying the reconstruction chemistry are summarized, and an outlook for the further development of complete reconstruction is briefly proposed. This review will arouse the attention on complete reconstruction materials and their applications in diverse fields.

         <dc:description>
Ag2S quantum dots (QDs) are an emerging class of near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) QDs with excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. The various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs are presented, focusing on their bioapplications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives with respect to the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.








Abstract
Quantum dots (QDs) with near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIR) are an emerging class of QDs with unique capabilities owing to the deeper tissue penetrability of NIR light compared with visible light. NIR light also effectively overcomes organism autofluorescence, making NIR QDs particularly attractive in biological imaging applications for disease diagnosis. Considering latest developments, Ag2S QDs are a rising star among NIR QDs due to their excellent NIR fluorescence properties and biocompatibility. This review presents the various methods to synthesize NIR Ag2S QDs, and systematically discusses their applications in biosensing, bioimaging, and theranostics. Major challenges and future perspectives concerning the synthesis and bioapplications of NIR Ag2S QDs are discussed.

         <title>Alternative Lone&#8208;Pair ns2&#8208;Cation&#8208;Based Semiconductors beyond Lead Halide Perovskites for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of recent progress on emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations is provided, with the purpose of providing valid insights for discovering auspicious optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. The issues hindering performance enhancement and the design strategies of novel ns2&#8208;cation&#8208;based optoelectronic semiconductors are discussed.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as advantageous high&#8208;performance optoelectronic semiconductors, and have undergone rapid development for diverse applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes , and photodetectors. While material instability and lead toxicity are still major concerns hindering their commercialization, they offer promising prospects and design principles for developing promising optoelectronic materials. The distinguished optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites stem from the Pb2+ cation with a lone&#8208;pair 6s2 electronic configuration embedded in a mixed covalent&#8211;ionic bonding lattice. Herein, we&#160;summarize alternative Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing lone&#8208;pair ns2 cations, intending to offer insights for developing potential optoelectronic materials other than lead halide perovskites. We&#160;start with the physical underpinning of how the ns2 cations within the material lattice allow for superior optoelectronic properties. We&#160;then review the emerging Pb&#8208;free semiconductors containing ns2 cations in terms of structural dimensionality, which is crucial for optoelectronic performance. For each category of materials, the research progresses on crystal structures, electronic/optical properties, device applications, and recent efforts for performance enhancements are overviewed. Finally, the issues hindering the further developments of studied materials are surveyed along with possible strategies to overcome them, which also provides an outlook on the future research in this field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 32, August 12, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) luminogens (AIEgens) are one of the optimal choices for smart luminescent materials to be applied in real life and they have sparked much of the current interest in the smart materials area. Therefore, a myriad of AIE materials with diverse stimuli&#8208;responsive properties have been developed in recent years, and they exhibit broad application prospects.








Abstract
The unique advantages and the exciting application prospects of AIEgens have triggered booming developments in this area in recent years. Among them, stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens have received particular attention and impressive progress, and they have been demonstrated to show tremendous potential in many fields from physical chemistry to materials science and to biology and medicine. Here, the recent achievements of stimuli&#8208;responsive AIEgens in terms of seven most representative types of stimuli including force, light, polarity, temperature, electricity, ion, and pH, are summarized. Based on typical examples, it is illustrated how each type of systems realize the desired stimuli&#8208;responsive performance for various applications. The key work principles behind them are ultimately deciphered and figured out to offer new insights and guidelines for the design and engineering of the next&#8208;generation stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials for more broad applications.

         <title>Marked Passivation Effect of Naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;Dicarboximides in High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaromatic passivator 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl substituted naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide provides chemical passivation (protonic/Lewis&#8208;base groups system) and energetic passivation (creating benign midgap states) effects. The Lewis&#8208;base/polyaromatic conjugation/protonic system reduces defects efficiently and avoids superoxide anions in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
As game&#8208;changers in the photovoltaic community, perovskite solar cells are making unprecedented progress while still facing grand challenges such as improving lifetime without impairing efficiency. Herein, two structurally alike polyaromatic molecules based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI) and perylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI) with different molecular dipoles are applied to tackle this issue. Contrasting the electronically pull&#8211;pull cyanide&#8208;substituted PMI (9CN&#8208;PMI) with only Lewis&#8208;base groups, the push&#8211;pull 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl&#8208;substituted NMI (4OH&#8208;NMI) with both protonic and Lewis&#8208;base groups can provide better chemical passivation for both shallow&#8208; and deep&#8208;level defects. Moreover, combined theoretical and experimental studies show that the 4OH&#8208;NMI can bind more firmly with perovskite and the polyaromatic backbones create benign midgap states in the excited perovskite to suppress the damage by superoxide anions (energetic passivation). The polar and protonic nature of 4OH&#8208;NMI facilitates band alignment and regulates the viscosity of the precursor solution for thicker perovskite films with better morphology. Consequently, the 4OH&#8208;NMI&#8208;passivated perovskite films exhibit reduced grain boundaries and nearly three&#8208;times lower defect density, boosting the device efficiency to 23.7%. A more effective design of the passivator for perovskites with multi&#8208;passivation mechanisms is provided in this study.

         <title>In Situ Tumor Vaccination with Nanoparticle Co&#8208;Delivering CpG and STAT3 siRNA to Effectively Induce Whole&#8208;Body Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors (AIRISE&#8208;02) is a nano&#8208;immunotherapeutic candidate that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA to a local tumor, generating anti&#8208;tumor immune response against cancer everywhere in the body (both treated and untreated tumors). Combination of AIRISE&#8208;02 and standard immune checkpoint inhibitors cures 63% of mice with melanoma tumors, while the inhibitors alone cure none.








Abstract
The success of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a subset of individuals has been very exciting. However, in many cancers, responses to current ICIs are modest and are seen only in a small subsets of patients. Herein, a widely applicable approach that increases the benefit of ICIs is reported. Intratumoral administration of augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors&#8212;AIRISE&#8208;02 nanotherapeutic that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA&#8212;results in not only regression of the injected tumor, but also tumors at distant sites in multiple tumor model systems. In particular, three doses of AIRISE&#8208;02 in combination with systemic ICIs completely cure both treated and untreated aggressive melanoma tumors in 63% of mice, while ICIs alone do not cure any mice. A long&#8208;term memory immune effect is also reported. AIRISE&#8208;02 is effective in breast and colon tumor models as well. Lastly, AIRISE&#8208;02 is well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates. This approach combines multiple therapeutic agents into a single nanoconstruct to create whole&#8208;body immune responses across multiple cancer types. Being a local therapeutic, AIRISE&#8208;02 circumvents regulatory challenges of systemic nanoparticle delivery, facilitating rapid translation to the clinic. AIRISE&#8208;02 is under investigational new drug (IND)&#8208;enabling studies, and clinical trials will soon follow.

Intratumoral administration of augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors&#8212;AIRISE-02 nanotherapeutic that co-delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA&#8212;results in not only regression of the injected tumor, but also tumors at distant sites in multiple tumor model systems. In particular, three doses of AIRISE-02 in combination with systemic ICIs completely cure both treated and untreated aggressive melanoma tumors in 63% of mice, while ICIs alone do not cure any mice. A long-term memory immune effect is also reported. AIRISE-02 is effective in breast and colon tumor models as well. Lastly, AIRISE-02 is well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates. This approach combines multiple therapeutic agents into a single nanoconstruct to create whole-body immune responses across multiple cancer types. Being a local therapeutic, AIRISE-02 circumvents regulatory challenges of systemic nanoparticle delivery, facilitating rapid translation to the clinic. AIRISE-02 is under investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies, and clinical trials will soon follow.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manipulating Ferromagnetism in Few&#8208;Layered Cr2Ge2Te6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ionic conductors as the gate dielectric, the easy&#8208;axis of the ferromagnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 thin flakes can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to the in&#8208;plane direction by an electric field, coinciding with a significant increase of the Curie temperature. The surface of the sample is fully exposed in this type of devices, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible.








Abstract
The discovery of magnetism in 2D materials offers new opportunities for exploring novel quantum states and developing spintronic devices. In this work, using field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ion conductors as the gate dielectric (SIC&#8208;FETs), we&#160;have observed a significant enhancement of ferromagnetism associated with magnetic easy&#8208;axis switching in few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. The easy axis of the magnetization, inferred from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to an in&#8208;plane direction by electric field in the few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. Additionally, the Curie temperature, obtained from both the Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, increases from 65 to 180 K in the few&#8208;layered sample by electric gating. Moreover, the surface of the sample is fully exposed in the SIC&#8208;FET device configuration, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible. This work offers an excellent platform for realizing electrically controlled quantum phenomena in a single device.

         <title>2D High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide alloys containing 4 or 5 transition metals are synthesized based on first&#8208;principles stability predictions. The 5&#8208;component alloy (MoWVNbTa)S2 is shown to be an excellent electrocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into CO. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that a small concentration of highly active sites is responsible for the high activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys combine multiple principal elements at a near equal fraction to form vast compositional spaces to achieve outstanding functionalities that are absent in alloys with one or two principal elements. Here, the prediction, synthesis, and multiscale characterization of 2D high&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) alloys with four/five transition metals is reported. Of these, the electrochemical performance of a five&#8208;component alloy with the highest configurational entropy, (MoWVNbTa)S2, is investigated for CO2 conversion to CO, revealing an excellent current density of 0.51 A cm&#8722;2 and a turnover frequency of 58.3 s&#8722;1 at &#8776; &#8722;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the superior CO2 electroreduction is due to a multi&#8208;site catalysis wherein the atomic&#8208;scale disorder optimizes the rate&#8208;limiting step of CO desorption by facilitating isolated transition metal edge sites with weak CO binding. 2D high&#8208;entropy TMDC alloys provide a materials platform to design superior catalysts for many electrochemical systems.

         <title>Powering Electronic Devices from Salt Gradients in AA&#8208;Battery&#8208;Sized Stacks of Hydrogel&#8208;Infused Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most powerful electric fish, the Atlantic torpedo ray, uses sheet&#8208;like electrically active cells within its electric organs to produce external electrical discharges of up to 1&#160;kW. A paper&#8208;based artificial electric organ is presented, which mimics the torpedo strategies for optimal power generation, resulting in a small and potentially biocompatible energy&#8208;storage device capable of operating real&#8208;world electronics.








Abstract
Strongly electric fish use gradients of ions within their bodies to generate stunning external electrical discharges; the most powerful of these organisms, the Atlantic torpedo ray, can produce pulses of over 1&#160;kW from its electric organs. Despite extensive study of this phenomenon in nature, the development of artificial power generation schemes based on ion gradients for portable, wearable, or implantable human use has remained out of reach. Previously, an artificial electric organ inspired by the electric eel demonstrated that electricity generated from ion gradients within stacked hydrogels can exceed 100&#160;V. The current of this power source, however, was&#160;too low to power standard electronics. Here, an artificial electric organ inspired by the unique morphologies of torpedo rays for maximal current output is introduced. This power source uses a hybrid material of hydrogel&#8208;infused paper to create, organize, and reconfigure stacks of thin, arbitrarily large gel films in series and in parallel. The resulting increase in electrical power by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the original eel&#8208;inspired design makes it possible to power electronic devices and establishes that biology's mechanism of generating significant electrical power can now be realized from benign and soft materials in a portable size.

         <title>Construction of Supercapacitor&#8208;Based Ionic Diodes with Adjustable Bias Directions by Using Poly(ionic liquid) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulation strategy to design bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable supercapacitor&#8208;diodes is demonstrated. Such multifunctional devices show excellent charge&#8208;storage performance and rectification performance, which fills a gap in the current capacitive ionic diodes.








Abstract
The newly emerging supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode), integrating the characteristics of a diode into an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor, can be employed to extend conventional supercapacitors to new technological applications and may play a crucial role in grid stabilization, signal propagation, and logic operations. However, the reported CAPodes have only been able to realize charge storage in the positive&#8208;bias direction. Here, bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable CAPodes realized by using a polycation&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) or a polyanion&#8208;based IL as electrolyte in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor architecture are proposed. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage function at only the positive&#8208; or negative&#8208;bias direction with a high rectification ratio (&#8776;80% for rectification ratio II, RRII) and an outstanding cycling life (4500 cycles), representing a crucial breakthrough for designing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Transparent Omni&#8208;Directional Stretchable Circuit Lines Made by a Junction&#8208;Free Grid of Expandable Au Lines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to fabricate omni&#8208;directional stretchable gold (Au) circuit lines with high transparency, high electrical conductivity, and negligible resistance change is presented. Metals are deposited directly over the crack&#8208;controlled poly(dimethylsiloxane) surface forming grid inside the cracks. This study demonstrates a highly transparent, stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode with a patterned Au line circuit board.








Abstract
Although various stretchable optoelectronic devices have been reported, omni&#8208;directionally stretchable transparent circuit lines have been a great challenge. Cracks are engineered and fabricated to be highly conductive patterned metal circuit lines in which gold (Au) grids are embedded. Au is deposited selectively in the cracks to form a grid without any junction between the grid lines. Since each grid line is expandable under stretching, the circuit lines are stretchable in all the directions. This study shows that a thin coating of aluminum on the oxide surface enables precise control of the cracks (crack density, crack depth) in the oxide layer. High optical transparency and high stretchability can be achieved simultaneously by controlling the grid density in the circuit line. Light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated directly on the circuit lines and stable operation is demonstrated under 100% stretching.

         <title>Synthesis of a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Perovskite SmTiO2N Bifunctional Photocatalyst via an Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Layered&#8208;Precursor Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new n&#8208;type perovskite SmTiO2N photocatalyst with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV is synthesized to show functionalities of both water reduction and oxidation under visible light, whose success is ascribed to the development of an evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy that is of generality for synthesis of other oxynitrides.








Abstract
Development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive oxynitride photocatalysts has been highly inspired for promising solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, but the number of Ti&#8208;based oxynitrides is scarce because of the relatively low thermal stability of Ti4+ ions under ammonia flow. Here, the feasible synthesis of a novel perovskite SmTiO2N from the layered NaSmTiO4 precursor is demonstrated to exhibit wide visible&#8208;light response with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and to show effective water reduction and oxidation functionalities under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The successful preparation mainly results from the synergistic effect of the layered structure of NaSmTiO4 and the evaporation spillover of Na+ ions, both of which are favorable for ammonia diffusion to accelerate the substitution of nitrogen to oxygen atoms and to shorten the nitridation time. The thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of SmTiO2N for water splitting are investigated in detail, and its optimal apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of water oxidation reaches 16.7% at 420&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;nm, higher by far than that of most previous visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts. Interestingly, a series of oxynitrides RTiO2N (R = La, Pr, Nd) are similarly synthesized by the alkali&#8208;metal evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy, demonstrating its generality to prepare visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive (oxy)nitride photocatalysts containing reducible metals for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Emulsion&#8208;Guided Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Particles: Droplet Size Determines Particle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of a series of novel anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) using an emulsion&#8208;templating method is described. The geometry of the APPs is determined by the average size of the oil droplets, based on a new mechanism. The APPs can be converted to anisotropic carbon particles with their architectures, which can be used as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Anisotropic particles have attracted significant attention due to their alluring features that distinguish them from isotropic particles. One of the most appealing strategies for the synthesis of anisotropic particles is the emulsion&#8208;guided method. However, morphological control and the understanding of formation mechanisms have remained a major challenge. Based on a novel mechanism, here, a facile one&#8208;pot emulsion&#8208;templating method for the tunable construction of anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) with different defined structures is reported. Three types of monocomponent APPs with new morphologies and sizes in the range of 240&#8211;650&#160;nm, including Janus mushroom&#8208;like mesoporous poly(m&#8208;phenylenediamine) (PmPD) particles, wheel&#8208;shaped particles, and acorn&#8208;like PmPD particles, are obtained by controlling the average size of the oil droplets in the emulsion. Furthermore, the APPs demonstrate the ability for conversion to nitrogen&#8208;doped anisotropic carbon particles (ACPs) by pyrolysis at 800&#160;&#176;C under a N2 atmosphere, thereby inheriting their structures. These novel ACPs show appreciable potential as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for use in oxygen reduction reactions. Compared to their isotropic counterpart, these ACPs exhibit remarkable advantages such as enhanced specific surface area and pore volume, reduced stacking density, and easy fabrication of continuous and uniform membrane electrodes.

A full&#8208;spectrum responsive donor&#8211;acceptor supramolecular photocatalyst TPPS/C60 is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%. The TPPS/C60 performs with a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts.

Abstract
A full&#8208;spectrum (300&#8211;850&#160;nm) responsive donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) supramolecular photocatalyst tetraphenylporphinesulfonate/fullerene (TPPS/C60) is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%, offering the possibility of full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. The TPPS/C60 performs a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 276.55&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure effectively promotes electron transfer from TPPS to C60, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction. Specifically, a giant internal electric field in the D&#8211;A structure is built via the enhanced molecular dipole, which dramatically promotes the charge separation (CS) efficiency by 2.35 times. Transient absorption spectra results show a long&#8208;lived CS state TPPS&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8722; in the D&#8211;A structure, which effectively promotes participation of photogenerated electrons in the reduction reaction. Briefly, this work provides a novel approach for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic materials via enhancing the interfacial electric field.

Abstract
The fast and reversible potassiation/depotassiation of anode materials remains an elusive yet intriguing goal. Herein, a class of the P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires with Te vacancy defects supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) is designed and prepared, taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the conductive o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2 arrays with rich Te vacancy defects and the elastic MXene sheets with self&#8208;autoadjustable function. Consequently, the o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted potassium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (373.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), remarkable rate capability (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cyclability (0.011% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1), representing the best performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenides&#8208;based anodes to date. Impressively, the flexible full battery with o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode achieves a satisfying energy density of 275&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high bending stability. The kinetics analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable K+ ion adsorption and diffusion capability, corroborating fast K+ ion storage. Especially, ex situ characterizations confirm o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of initially proceeding with the K+ ion insertion, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism.

A simple &#8220;monomers&#8211;nanofibers&#8211;macroscopic product&#8221; hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach for the preparation of all&#8208;aramid bulk and honeycomb materials, which are difficult to process in traditional ways, is demonstrated. These products show excellent mechanical and thermal performance. This work is a breakthrough for the processing of high&#8208;performance engineering polymer material, and the industrialization prospect of all&#8208;aramid products deserves further study.








Abstract
The processing of poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) has long been a great challenge. This work reports a simple &#8220;monomers&#8208;nanofibers&#8208;macroscopic product&#8221; (MNM) hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach to build 3D&#160;all&#8208;PPTA engineering materials. This approach mainly includes the preparation of polymerization&#8208;induced aramid nanofibers (PANFs) from monomers and the fabrication of all&#8208;PPTA materials from PANF hydrogel. Various 3D architectures, including simple solid bulks and sophisticated honeycombs (HCs), are obtained after the dehydration and shrinking of the PANF hydrogel. The tensile strength and compressive yield strength of PANF bulk are more than 62 and 90&#160;MPa, respectively, which are comparable to typical engineering plastics. The compressive strength of PANF HC with a density of 360&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;3 is more than 24&#160;MPa. The thermal stability of PANF bulk and PANF HC are as good as that of Kevlar fiber and almost no decomposition occurred before 500&#160;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, the MNM process is performed under mild conditions, without high temperature, high pressure, or corrosive solvent. The MNM process is a novel strategy for the processing of all aromatic polyamide materials with complex structures and high performances and would be another development since the breakthrough of liquid crystal spinning technology of PPTA.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atomic Iron&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Integrated 3D&#8208;Printed Bioscaffolds for Osteosarcoma Destruction with Antibacterial and Bone Defect Regeneration Bioactivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;catalyst&#8208;engineered 3D scaffolds for osteosarcoma therapy and bone regeneration are reported. A single&#8208;atomic iron catalyst with highly effective hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced catalytic radical generating activities is engineered into a 3D&#8208;printed bioglass scaffold to achieve comprehensive osteosarcoma elimination, antibacterial properties, and bone defect regeneration with biocompatibility.








Abstract
Effective antitumor therapeutics with distinctive bactericidal and osteogenic properties are in high demand for comprehensive osteosarcoma treatment. Here, a &#8220;scaffold engineering&#8221; strategy that integrates highly active single&#8208;atomic iron catalysts (FeSAC) into a 3D printed bioactive glass (BG) scaffold is reported. Based on the atomically dispersed iron species within the catalysts, the engineered FeSAC displays prominent Fenton catalytic activity to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in response to the microenvironment specific to osteosarcoma. In addition, the constructed FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold can serve as a sophisticated biomaterial platform for efficient osteosarcoma ablation, with concomitant bacterial sterilization via localized hyperthermia&#8208;reinforced nanocatalytic therapeutics. The destruction of the osteosarcoma, as well as the bacterial foci, can be achieved, further preventing susceptible chronic osteomyelitis during osteogenesis. In particular, the engineered FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold is identified with advances in accelerated osteoconduction and osteoinduction, ultimately contributing to the sophisticated therapeutics and management of osteosarcoma. This work broadens the biomedical potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts and offers a comprehensive clinically feasible strategy for overall osteosarcoma therapeutics, bacterial inhibition, and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Nanotexture Shape and Surface Energy Impact on Electroadhesive Human&#8211;Machine Interface Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion&#8208;based haptics technology has received substantial attention in recent years and has seen a rapidly expanding inclusion in current ubiquitous interactive touch surfaces. This work studies the underlying multiphysics mechanism at the nanoasperity level and provides a novel insight for the design and optimization of future electroadhesive finger&#8211;device interfaces for higher efficiency and reduced variability.








Abstract
With the ubiquity of touch screens and the commercialization of electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices, modeling tools that capture the multiphysical phenomena within the finger&#8211;device interface and their interaction are critical to design devices that achieve higher performance and reliability at lower cost. While electroadhesion has successfully demonstrated the capability to change tactile perception through friction modulation, the mechanism of electroadhesion in the finger&#8211;device interface is still unclear, partly due to the complex interfacial physics including contact deformation, capillary formation, electric field, and their complicated coupling effects that have not been addressed comprehensively. A multiphysics model is presented here to predict the friction force for finger&#8211;surface tactile interactions at the nanoscale. The nanoscopic multiphysical phenomena are coupled to study the impacts of nanotexture and surface energy in the touch interface. With macroscopic friction force measurements as verification, the model is further used to propose textures that have maximum electroadhesion effect and minimum sensitivity to relative humidity and user perspiration rate. This model can guide the performance improvement of future electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices and other touch&#8208;based human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Fully Inorganic Colloidal Gold Nanocluster and Their Manipulation Using Surface Charge Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;controlled generation of fully inorganic gold nanoclusters is demonstrated by a modern laser&#8208;based synthesis method. These colloidal species exhibit a bright blue photoluminescence, for which the intensity is a direct function of the surface charge density adjustable by the pH of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, these particles offer the opportunity to dedicate photoluminescence to core and surface state transitions.








Abstract
Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal&#8211;organic ligand&#8208;capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size&#8208;controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc&#8208;like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2&#8211;2.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall (&lt;1&#160;nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core&#8208; or surface&#8208;based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium.

     alt="Photoluminescence of Fully Inorganic Colloidal Gold Nanocluster and Their Manipulation Using Surface Charge Effects"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The size-controlled generation of fully inorganic gold nanoclusters is demonstrated by a modern laser-based synthesis method. These colloidal species exhibit a bright blue photoluminescence, for which the intensity is a direct function of the surface charge density adjustable by the pH of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, these particles offer the opportunity to dedicate photoluminescence to core and surface state transitions.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal&#8211;organic ligand-capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size-controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc-like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2&#8211;2.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall (&amp;lt;1&#160;nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core- or surface-based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Facet Engineering to Regulate Surface States of Topological Crystalline Insulator Bismuth Rhombic Dodecahedrons for Highly Energy Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological surface states and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap of Bi rhombic dodecahedrons facilitate highly selective formate production in a wide current density range, leading to a high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (maximum value of 69.5%) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This electrocatalyst can potentially be used for intermittent energy storage.








Abstract
Bismuth (Bi) is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which has gapless topological surface states (TSSs) protected by a specific crystalline symmetry that strongly depends on the facet. Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single&#8208;crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &gt;92.2%)&#160;in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, leading to a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO2RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO2RR. This study describes a promising application of Bi RDs for high&#8208;rate formate production and high&#8208;efficiency energy storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Optimizing the geometry of TCIs is also proposed as an effective strategy to tune the TSSs of topological catalysts.

         <title>Crowning Metal Ions by Supramolecularization as a General Remedy toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free Alkali&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general supramolecularization strategy with size&#8208;matching crown ethers is proposed to protect alkali&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). The unique electrostatic shielding layer and organic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) induced by the crown ether&#8211;Li+/Na+/K+ assembly effectively inhibit the growth of alkali&#8208;metal dendrites and largely improve the lifespan of alkali&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Alkali metals have low potentials and high capacities, making them ideal anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries, but they suffer major problems, including dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency (CE). Achieving uniform metal deposition and having a reliable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are the basic requirements for overcoming these problems. Here, a general remedy is reported for various alkali&#8208;metal anodes by the supramolecularization of alkali&#8208;metal cations with crown ethers that follows a size&#8208;matching rule. The positively charged supramolecular complex provides electrostatic shielding layers to regulate metal deposition and suppress dendrite formation. More promisingly, it reforms electric double layers and drives the production of organic&#8208;dominated SEIs with improved flexibility that can accommodate large volume changes. The high flexibility of SEIs during metal deposition and dissolution reduces the amount of dead metal and improves CE and cycling stability. Specifically, a 200% excess Li&#8208;based full cell has a capacity retention of &#8776;100% after 100 cycles. This crown&#8208;like supramolecularization strategy is a new chemistry that may be used for the production of dendrite&#8208;free metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries not limited to the cases with alkali metal. It is also expected as a practical technology to improve the uniformity of coatings produced in the electrodeposition industry.

         <title>Phase Coexistence and Structural Dynamics of Redox Metal Catalysts Revealed by Operando TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical dynamics (characterized by phase coexistence and oscillatory phase transition) of redox metal catalysts and their relevance to catalytic activity are revealed by operando transmission electron microscopy. This work underlines the importance of chemical dynamics and provides a convenient mechanism for the formation and constant regeneration of transient active sites during catalysis.








Abstract
Metal catalysts play an important role in industrial redox reactions. Although extensively studied, the state of these catalysts under operating conditions is largely unknown, and assignments of active sites remain speculative. Herein, an operando transmission electron microscopy study is presented, which interrelates the structural dynamics of redox metal catalysts to their activity. Using hydrogen oxidation on copper as an elementary redox reaction, it is revealed how the interaction between metal and the surrounding gas phase induces complex structural transformations and drives the system from a thermodynamic equilibrium toward a state controlled by the chemical dynamics. Direct imaging combined with the simultaneous detection of catalytic activity provides unparalleled structure&#8211;activity insights that identify distinct mechanisms for water formation and reveal the means by which the system self&#8208;adjusts to changes of the gas&#8208;phase chemical potential. Density functional theory calculations show that surface phase transitions are driven by chemical dynamics even when the system is far from a thermodynamic phase boundary. In a bottom&#8208;up approach, the dynamic behavior observed here for an elementary reaction is finally extended to more relevant redox reactions and other metal catalysts, which underlines the importance of chemical dynamics for the formation and constant re&#8208;generation of transient active sites during catalysis.

         <title>Harvesting Cool Daylight in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Halides Microtubules through the Reservation of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
After pressure processing, the quenched products possess unexpected intense emission exceeding ten times that of the initial state, accompanied by efficient color temperature tuning from weak sky blue to very bright cool daylight. The irreversible electronic transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules, is highly responsible for the eventual retention of pressure&#8208;induced emission.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is extensively studied in halide perovskites or derivative hybrid halides. However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2ZnBr4) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of &#8220;sky blue light&#8221; before compression to &#8220;cool daylight&#8221; with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next&#8208;generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid&#8208;state lighting applications.

         <title>A Gas&#8208;Steamed MOF Route to P&#8208;Doped Open Carbon Cages with Enhanced Zn&#8208;Ion Energy Storage Capability and Ultrastability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open&#8208;wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one&#8208;step process. Taking the advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage performance is displayed.








Abstract
Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a solid&#8208;state gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. Also, they exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of up to 300&#160;000 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention. Particularly, such OCCs as electrode materials lead to a soft&#8208;pack ZHSC device, delivering a high energy density of 97&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a superb power density of 6.5&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Further, the device can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;25 to + 40&#160;&#176;C, covering the temperatures for practical applications in daily life.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds as Versatile Reagents for Extremely Efficient and Reversible Patterning of Graphene with Nanoscale Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene are demonstrated by using hypervalent iodine compounds in combination with laser writing, realizing the first patterned hydroxylation as well as unprecedented degrees of patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation of graphene. The graphene patterning is completely reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over 2D chemical information on graphene.








Abstract
Rational patterning and tailoring of graphene relies on the disclosure of suitable reagents for structuring the target functionalities on the 2D&#8208;carbon network. Here, a series of hypervalent iodine compounds, namely, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxol&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;one, 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole, and 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole is reported to be extremely efficient for a diversified graphene patterning. The decomposition of these compounds generates highly reactive Cl, OH, and CF3 radicals exclusively in the irradiated areas, which subsequently attach onto the graphene leading to locally controlled chlorination, hydroxylation, and trifluoromethylation, respectively. This is the first realization of a patterned hydroxylation of graphene, and the degrees of functionalization of the patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation are both unprecedented. The usage of these mild reagents here is reasonably facile compared to the reported methods using hazardous Cl2 or ICl and allows for sophisticated pattern designs with nanoscale precision, promising for arbitrary nanomanipulation of graphene's properties like hydrophilicity and conductivity by the three distinct functionalities (Cl, OH, and CF3). Moreover, the attachment of functional entities to these highly functionalized graphene nanoarchitectures is fully reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling a full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over the chemical information stored within graphene. This work provides an exciting clue for target 2D functionalization and modulation of graphene by using suitable hypervalent iodine compounds.

         <title>Significant Performance Improvement in n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with C60:C70 Co&#8208;Crystals Induced by Poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) Nanodots</title>

18&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced electron mobility is achieved for n&#8208;channel organic field&#8208;effect transistors with co&#8208;crystalized C60:C70 blend films formed on nanodot&#8208;structured dipolar poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz) interlayers that also reduce the work function of the electrodes. The PEOz nanodot layers further deliver high spatial uniformity in electron mobility and enhance device stability for transistor array fabrication.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted great interest due to their potential as logic devices for bendable and flexible electronics. In relation to n&#8208;channel structures, soluble fullerene semiconductors have been widely studied. However, they have not yet met the essential requirements for commercialization, primarily because of low charge carrier mobility, immature large&#8208;scale fabrication processes, and insufficient long&#8208;term operational stability. Interfacial engineering of the carrier&#8208;injecting source/drain (S/D) electrodes has been proposed as an effective approach to improve charge injection, leading also to overall improved device characteristics. Here, it is demonstrated that a non&#8208;conjugated neutral dipolar polymer, poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz), formed as a nanodot structure on the S/D electrodes, enhances electron mobility in n&#8208;channel OFETs using a range of soluble fullerenes. Overall performance is especially notable for (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) and (C70&#8208;D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene (C70) blend films, with an increase from 0.1 to 2.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The high relative mobility and eighteen&#8208;fold improvement are attributed not only to the anticipated reduction in S/D electrode work function but also to the beneficial effects of PEOz on the formation of a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic C60:C70 co&#8208;crystal structure within the blend films.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Activatable Dynamic Nanoparticles Boosting Ferroptotic Cell Death for Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable nanoparticles integrating dynamic covalent bonds are developed for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL&#8208;3 and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nanoparticle&#8208;based GPX4 inhibition and PDT significantly promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and activate the T&#8208;cell immune response for inhibiting tumor growth and suppressing distant metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows promising therapeutic potential for long&#8208;term tumor regression. However, current cancer immunotherapy displays a low response rate due to insufficient immunogenicity of the tumor cells. To address these challenges, herein, intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable dynamic nanoparticles for eliciting immunogenicity by inducing ferroptosis of the tumor cells are engineered. The nanoparticles are engineered by integrating an ionizable block copolymer and acid&#8208;liable phenylboronate ester (PBE) dynamic covalent bonds for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of the ferroptosis inducer, a glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL&#8208;3. The nanoparticles can stably encapsulate RSL&#8208;3 inside the hydrophobic core via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction with the PBE groups at neutral pH (pH = 7.4), while releasing the payload in the endocytic vesicles (pH = 5.8&#8211;6.2) by acidity&#8208;triggered cleavage of the PBE dynamic covalent bonds. Furthermore, the nanoparticles can perform acid&#8208;activatable photodynamic therapy&#160;by protonation of the ionizable core, and significantly recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes for interferon gamma secretion, and thus sensitize the tumor cells to RSL&#8208;3&#8208;inducible ferroptosis. The combination of nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis and blockade of programmed death ligand 1&#160;efficiently inhibits growth of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma tumor and lung metastasis of 4T1 breast tumors, suggesting the promising potential of ferroptosis induction for promoting cancer immunotherapy.

The combination of nanoparticle-induced ferroptosis and blockade of programmed death ligand 1&#160;efficiently inhibits growth of B16-F10 melanoma tumor and lung metastasis of 4T1 breast tumors, suggesting the promising potential of ferroptosis induction for promoting cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dynamically Crosslinked Dry Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomers for Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamically crosslinked dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomers with exceptional properties of high ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, stretchability, and transparency are reported. Two self&#8208;healing stretchable iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are then realized with excellent environmental stability.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors show great promise in multifunctional iontronic devices, but currently utilized gel materials suffer from liquid leakage or evaporation issues. Here, a dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), self&#8208;healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self&#8208;healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.

         <title>Expanding Biomaterial Surface Topographical Design Space through Natural Surface Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topographical design space is immense, with many geometries existing. To explore this design space on cell behavior, the TopoChip is utilized with 2176 unique microtopographies. Nevertheless, phenotypical readouts are potentially lost due to an incomplete design space coverage. This coverage is expanded effectively in this work by including natural surfaces such as the red rose, leading to novel phenotypical discoveries.








Abstract
Surface topography is a tool to endow biomaterials with bioactive properties. However, the large number of possible designs makes it challenging to find the optimal surface structure to induce a specific cell response. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed microtopographies. Still, it is exploring only a small part of the design space due to design algorithm limitations and the surface engineering strategy. Inspired by the diversity of natural surfaces, it is assessed as to what extent the topographical design space and consequently the resulting cellular responses can be expanded using natural surfaces. To this end, 26 plant and insect surfaces are replicated in polystyrene and their surface properties are quantified using white light interferometry. Through machine&#8208;learning algorithms, it is demonstrated that natural surfaces extend the design space of the TopoChip, which coincides with distinct morphological and focal adhesion profiles in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Furthermore, differentiation experiments reveal the strong potential of the holy lotus to improve osteogenesis in MSCs. In the future, the design algorithms will be trained with the results obtained by natural surface imprint experiments to explore the bioactive properties of novel surface topographies.

Immunotherapy&#8208;involved combination cancer therapy: the rapid development in the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities for cancer therapy are systematically reviewed, and the critical challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy that can activate immunity or enhance the immunogenicity of tumors has emerged as one of the most effective methods for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, single&#8208;mode immunotherapy is still confronted with several critical challenges, such as the low immune response, the low tumor infiltration, and the complex immunosuppression tumor microenvironment. Recently, the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities has emerged as a powerful strategy to augment the therapeutic outcome in fighting against cancer. In this review, recent research advances of the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, metabolic therapy, and microwave thermotherapy are summarized. Critical challenges and future research direction of immunotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapeutic strategy are also discussed.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silicene/Silicon Nanosheets: An Emerging Silicon&#8208;Composed Nanostructure in Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developments in the construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8208;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics and antibacteria, are highlighted. A multi variate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these silicene/silicon nanosheets is conducted and an outlook for further clinical translations is given.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;composed nanomedicines are one of the most representative inorganic nanosystems in theranostic biomedicine. The emerging of new family members of silicon&#8208;composed nanosystems substantially contributes to their further clinical translation. 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have recently been developed as an emerging topology of silicon&#8208;composed nanoparticles, which features unique planar nanostructure with large surface area, abundant surface chemistry, specific physiochemical property, and desirable biological effects. This progress report highlights and discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;art developments of the elaborate construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8211;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering, and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics (e.g., bioimaging, photothermal ablation, chemotherapy, chemoreactive nanotherapy, radiotherapy, and synergistic nanotherapy) and antibacteria. Their large surface area originating from 2D nanostructure not only enables efficient loading and delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, but also guarantees the multifunctionalization. Especially, 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets harness desirable photothermal&#8208;conversion performance for photonic hyperthermia and photoacoustic imaging in the near infrared biowindow, accompanied with the desirable biodegradability and biocompatibility, which is typically not possessed in other silicon&#8208;composed counterparts. The multivariate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have also been conducted and outlooked for further underpinning their clinical translations.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely summary of the fantastic achievements in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) is provided with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;efficiency OLET devices. Finally, a brief conclusion is also given with comments on the challenges and prospective future research directions in this field. All these suggest a new development stage for OLETs and their related application fields under the joint efforts of scientists from different fields.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are possibly the smallest integrated optoelectronic devices that combine the switching and amplification mechanisms of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and the electroluminescent characteristic of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Such a unique architecture of OLETs makes them ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation display technology and electrically pumped lasers for miniaturized photonic devices and circuits. However, the development of OLETs has been slow. Recently, some exciting progress has been made with breakthroughs in high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs, and fabrication of novel multifunctional OLETs. This recent slew of advances may represent the advent of a new development stage of OLETs and their related devices and circuits. In this paper, a detailed review of these fantastic advances is presented, with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;performance OLETs. Finally, a brief conclusion is provided with a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives in this field.

Such a unique architecture of OLETs makes them ideal for developing the next-generation display technology and electrically pumped lasers for miniaturized photonic devices and circuits. However, the development of OLETs has been slow. Recently, some exciting progress has been made with breakthroughs in high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, construction of high-performance OLETs, and fabrication of novel multifunctional OLETs. This recent slew of advances may represent the advent of a new development stage of OLETs and their related devices and circuits. In this paper, a detailed review of these fantastic advances is presented, with a special focus on the key points for developing high-performance OLETs. Finally, a brief conclusion is provided with a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives in this field.&lt;/p&gt;

The hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of hydrogen fuel. Alkaline water splitting represents the most mature and economic technology for clean hydrogen production, making high potential for successful implementation of hydrogen economy.








Abstract
Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry&#8208;relevant developments. Some recent works about scaled&#8208;up catalyst synthesis, novel electrode designs, and alkaline seawater electrolysis are also spotlighted. Finally, an outlook on future challenges and opportunities for alkaline water splitting is offered, and potential future directions are speculated.

         <title>Mapping the Design of Electrolyte Materials for Electrically Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>

Electrolyte materials play a significant role in the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and low&#8208;cost electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. The challenges and progress in electrolyte materials are presented, with the aim of providing insight into the future development of novel electrolyte systems for electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ERZABs) have attracted substantial research interest as one of the best candidate power sources for electric vehicles, grid&#8208;scale energy storage, and portable electronics owing to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental benignity. However, the realization of ERZABs with long cycle life and high energy and power densities is still a considerable challenge. The electrolyte, which serves as the ionic conductor, is one of the core components of ERZABs, as it plays a significant role during the discharge&#8211;charge process and greatly influences the rechargeability, operating voltage, lifespan, power density, and safety of ERZABs. Herein, the fundamental electrochemistry of electrolyte materials for ERZABs and the associated challenges are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in electrolyte materials for ERZABs, including alkaline aqueous electrolytes, nonalkaline electrolytes, ionic liquids, and semisolid&#8208;state electrolytes are discussed. This work aims to provide insights into the future exploration of high&#8208;performance electrolytes and thus promote the development of ERZABs.

Abstract
Water oxidation, or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which combines two oxygen atoms from two water molecules and releases one oxygen molecule, plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for the hydrogen generation, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation. The multielectron transfer OER process involves multiple reaction intermediates, and a high overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics. Among the different water splitting devices, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer offers greater advantages. However, current anode OER electrocatalysts in PEM electrolyzers are limited to precious iridium and ruthenium oxides. Developing highly active, stable, and precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is attractive for the large&#8208;scale application of PEM electrolyzers. In recent years, various types of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts such as carbon&#8208;based materials, earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides, and multiple metal oxide mixtures have been investigated and some of them show promising activity and stability for acidic OER. In this review, the thermodynamics of water oxidation, Pourbaix diagram of metal elements in aqueous solution, and theoretical screening and prediction of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are first elaborated. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and mechanisms together with future research directions regarding acidic OER are summarized and discussed.
