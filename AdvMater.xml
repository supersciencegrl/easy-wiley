         <title>Lattice&#8208;Gradient Perovskite KTaO3 Films for an Ultrastable and Low&#8208;Dose X&#8208;Ray Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;gradient perovskite KTaO3 films have been grown via a solution epitaxy. A direct&#8208;type X&#8208;ray detector made of such film demonstrates long&#8208;term stability and a low detection limit, allowing it to obtain high&#8208;quality imaging. These achievements have been attributed to a built&#8208;in electric field generated by the lattice gradient within the films.








Abstract
Conventional indirect X&#8208;ray detectors employ scintillating phosphors to convert X&#8208;ray photons into photodiode&#8208;detectable visible photons, leading to low conversion efficiencies, low spatial resolutions, and optical crosstalk. Consequently, X&#8208;ray detectors that directly convert photons into electric signals have long been desired for high&#8208;performance medical imaging and industrial inspection. Although emerging hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic halide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbBr3, exhibit high sensitivity, they have salient drawbacks including structural instability, ion motion, and the use of toxic Pb. Here, this work reports an ultrastable, low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detector comprising KTaO3 perovskite films epitaxially grown on a Nb&#8208;doped strontium titanate substrate using a low&#8208;cost solution method. The detector exhibits a stable photocurrent under high&#8208;dose irradiation, high&#8208;temperature (200 &#176;C), and aqueous conditions. Moreover, the prototype KTaO3&#8208;film&#8208;based detector exhibits a 150&#8208;fold higher sensitivity (3150 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2) and 150&#8208;fold lower detection limit (&lt;40 nGyair s&#8722;1) than those of commercial &#945;&#8208;Se&#8208;based direct detectors. Systematic investigations reveal that the high stability of the detector originates from the strong covalent bonds within the KTaO3 film, whereas the low detection limit is due to a lattice&#8208;gradient&#8208;driven built&#8208;in electric field and the high insulating property of KTaO3 film. This study unveils a new path toward the fabrication of green, stable, and low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray detectors using oxide perovskite films, which have significant application potential in medical imaging and security operations.

         <title>Antibubbles Enable Tunable Payload Release with Low&#8208;Intensity Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibubbles are acoustically&#8208;active microstructures that encapsulate large volumes of fluid within an air bubble. Low&#8208;intensity ultrasound can remotely trigger rapid payload release from antibubbles, and the specific response can be tuned during fabrication. Unique release profiles can be realized, ranging from single&#8208;release to stepwise release for precise dosing over multiple stimulation pulses.








Abstract
The benefits of ultrasound are its ease&#8208;of&#8208;use and its ability to precisely deliver energy in opaque and complex media. However, most materials responsive to ultrasound show a weak response, requiring the use of high powers, which are associated with undesirable streaming, cavitation, or temperature rise. These effects hinder response control and may even cause damage to the medium where the ultrasound is applied. Moreover, materials that are currently in use rely on all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing effects, limiting the ability to fine&#8208;tune the response of the material on the fly. For these reasons, there is a need for materials that can respond to low intensity ultrasound with programmable responses. Here it is demonstrated that antibubbles are a low&#8208;intensity&#8208;ultrasound&#8208;responsive material system that can controllably release a payload using acoustic pressures in the kilopascal range. Varying their size and composition tunes the release pressure, and the response can be switched between a single release and stepwise release across multiple ultrasound pulses. Observations using confocal and high&#8208;speed microscopy reveal different ways that can lead to release. These findings lay the groundwork to design antibubbles that controllably respond to low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, opening a wide range of applications ranging from ultrasound&#8208;responsive material systems to carriers for targeted&#160;delivery.

         <title>2D Amorphous Iron Selenide Sulfide Nanosheets for Stable and Rapid Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D amorphous ternary iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a&#8208;FeSeS NSs) are fabricated via a facile wet chemical method. The elaborately designed electrode exhibits outstanding structural stability, negligible volume expansion, highly efficient reversible reaction, and high electrochemical kinetics. Such a 2D amorphization strategy offers guideline for synthesizing electrode materials with much improved overall performance for a variety of reversible energy storage devices.








Abstract
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from large electrode volume change and sluggish redox kinetics for the relatively large ionic radius of sodium ions, raising a significant challenge to improve their long&#8208;term cyclability and rate capacity. Here, it is proposed to apply 2D amorphous iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a&#8208;FeSeS NSs) as an anode material for SIBs and demonstrate that they exhibit remarkable rate capability of 528.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;life cycle (10&#160;000 cycles) performance (300.4 mAh g&#8722;1). This performance is much more superior to that of the previously reported Fe&#8208;based anode materials, which is attributed to their amorphous structure that alleviates volume expansion of electrode, 2D nature that facilitates electrons/ions transfer, and the S/Se double anions that offer more reaction sites and stabilize the amorphous structure. Such a 2D amorphous strategy provides a fertile platform for structural engineering of other electrode materials, making a more secure energy prospect closer to a reality.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seed nanocrystals can be successfully exploited to generate colloidal metal&#8211;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with programmable configurational diversity, not otherwise accessible by standard seeded&#8208;growth routes. Relevant synthetic strategies based on transformative paradigms are illustrated and rationalized on the basis of available mechanistic knowledge. Some key properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures demonstrate their relevance across several technological fields.








Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable of expressing richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded&#8208;growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seeds. The advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical&#8208;chemical properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized. Finally, prospects for developments in the field are outlined.

The quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) can only achieve high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at relatively low current density due to the efficiency roll&#8208;off effect. Here, this article reports an ultralow roll&#8208;off QLED, the EQE maintained over 20.6% up to 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, dropping only by &#8776;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%.








Abstract
Quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have attracted extensive attention due to their high color purity, solution&#8208;processability, and high brightness. Due to extensive efforts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of QLEDs has approached the theoretical limit. However, because of the efficiency roll&#8208;off, the high EQE can only be achieved at relatively low luminance, hindering their application in high&#8208;brightness devices such as near&#8208;to&#8208;eye displays and lighting applications. Here, this article reports an ultralow roll&#8208;off QLED that is achieved by simultaneously blocking electron leakage and enhancing the hole injection, thereby shifting the recombination zone back to the emitting QDs layer. These devices maintain EQE over 20.6% up to 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, dropping only by &#8776;5% from the peak EQE of 21.6%, which is the highest value ever reported for the bottom&#8208;emitting red QLEDs. Furthermore, the maximum luminance of the optimal device reaches 320&#8201;000 cd m&#8722;2, 2.7 times higher than the control device (Lmax: 128&#8201;000 cd m&#8722;2). A passive matrix (PM) QLED display panel with high brightness based on the optimized device structure is also demonstrated. The proposed approach advances the potential of QLEDs to operate efficiently in high&#8208;brightness scenarios.

         <title>Surface Energy Engineering of Buried Interface for Highly Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The abundant oxygen&#8208;related defects (e.g., O vacancies, O&#8208;H) in the TiO2 electron transport layer results in high surface energy, which is detrimental to effective carrier extraction and seriously impairs the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, novel surface energy engineering (SEE) was developed by applying a surfactant of heptadecafluorooctanesulphonate tetraethylammonium (HFSTA) on the surface of the TiO2. Theoretical calculations show that the HFSTA&#8208;TiO2 is less prone to form O vacancies, leading to lower surface energy, thus improving the carrier&#8208;extraction efficiency. The experimental results show that superior perovskite film was obtained due to the reduced heterogeneous nucleation sites and improved crystallization process on the modified TiO2. Furthermore, the flexible long alkyl chains in HFSTA considerably relieved the compressive stresses at the buried interface. By combining the passivation of TiO2, crystallization process modulation and stress relief, a champion PCE up to 25.03% was achieved. The device without encapsulation sustained 92.2% of its initial PCE after more than 2500&#160;h storage under air ambient with relative humidity of 25&#8211;30%. The SEE of a buried interface paves a new way towards high&#8208;efficiency, stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A 2d Heterostructure&#8208;Based Multifunctional Floating Gate Memory Device for Multimodal Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The demand for economical and efficient data processing has led to a surge of interest in neuromorphic computing based on emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in recent years. As a rising van der Waals (vdW) p&#8208;type Weyl semiconductor with many intriguing properties, tellurium has been widely used in advanced electronics/optoelectronics. However, its application in floating gate memory devices for information processing has never been explored. Herein, we report an electronic/optoelectronic floating gate memory device enabled by tellurium&#8208;based 2D vdW heterostructure for multimodal reservoir computing. When subjected to intense electrical/optical stimuli, our device exhibits impressive nonvolatile electronic memory behaviors including &#8764;108 extinction ratio, &#8764;100&#8208;ns switching speed, &gt;4000 cycles, &gt;4000&#8208;s retention stability, and nonvolatile multi&#8208;bit optoelectronic programmable characteristics. When the input stimuli weaken, the nonvolatile memory degrades into volatile memory. Leveraging these rich nonlinear dynamics, we demonstrate a multimodal reservoir computing system with high recognition accuracy of 90.77% for event&#8208;type multimodal handwritten digit&#8208;recognition.

Abstract
A microstructural informed thermodynamic model was utilized to tailor the pseudoelastic performance of a series of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni shape&#8208;memory alloys. Following this approach, the influence of the stability and the amount of the B2&#8208;ordered precipitates on the stability of the austenitic state and the pseudoelastic response was revealed. This was assessed by a combination of complementary nanoindentation measurements and incremental&#8208;strain tests under compressive loading. Based on these investigations, the applicability of the proposed models for the prediction of shape&#8208;memory capabilities of Fe&#8211;Mn&#8211;Al&#8211;Ni alloys was confirmed. Eventually, these thermodynamic considerations enable the guided enhancement of functional properties in this alloy system through the direct design of alloy compositions. The procedure proposed renders a significant advancement in the field of shape&#8208;memory alloys.

         <title>Engineering In Situ Catalytic Cleaning Membrane Via Prebiotic&#8208;Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Mineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile&#8208;mediated mineralization strategy is developed for aqueous dip&#8208;coating of catalytic nanomaterials onto the hydrophobic polymeric membrane at room temperature. The biomimetic mineralized superhydrophilic membrane enables the operando flux recovery beyond 99.8% and a ninefold higher flux recovery compared to the control one, attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;driven membrane separation promises a sustainable energy&#8208;water nexus but is hindered by ubiquitous fouling. Natural systems evolved from prebiotic chemistry offer a glimpse of creative solutions. Herein, a prebiotic&#8208;chemistry&#8208;inspired aminomalononitrile (AMN)/Mn2+&#8208;mediated mineralization method is reported for universally engineering a superhydrophilic hierarchical MnO2 nanocoating to endow hydrophobic polymeric membranes with exceptional catalytic cleaning ability. Green hydrogen peroxide catalytically triggered in&#8208;situ cleaning of the mineralized membrane and enabled operando flux recovery to reach 99.8%. The mineralized membrane exhibited a 9&#8208;fold higher recovery compared to the unmineralized membrane, which is attributed to active catalytic antifouling coupled with passive hydration antifouling. Electron density differences derived from the precursor interaction during mediated mineralization unveiled an electron&#8208;rich bell&#8208;like structure with an inner electron&#8208;deficient Mn core. This work paves the way to construct multifunctional engineered materials for energy&#8208;efficient water treatment as well as for diverse promising applications in catalysis, solar steam generation, biomedicine, and beyond.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Activated Cell Therapy for Accelerated Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; platform combining magneto&#8208;responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto&#8208;induced dynamic mechanical stimulation is developed for diabetic wound healing. It encapsulates fibroblasts and keratinocytes for superior wound closure, with enhanced cell proliferation, extracellular microenvironment production, and neo&#8208;vascularization, suggesting potential applicability to diabetic ulcer. Plus, leveraging scRNAseq data, a mechanosensitive fibroblast subpopulation is identified for further therapeutic impact.








Abstract
Chronic diabetic wounds are a significant global healthcare challenge. Current strategies, such as biomaterials, cell therapies, and medical devices, however, only target a few pathological features and have limited efficacy. A powerful platform technology combining magneto&#8208;responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto&#8208;induced dynamic mechanical stimulation (MDMS) is developed to accelerate diabetic wound healing. The hydrogel encapsulates U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#8208;approved fibroblasts and keratinocytes to achieve &#8764;3&#8208;fold better wound closure in a diabetic mouse model. MDMS acts as a nongenetic mechano&#8208;rheostat to activate fibroblasts, resulting in &#8764;240% better proliferation, &#8764;220% more collagen deposition, and improved keratinocyte paracrine profiles via the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway to boost angiogenesis.

&lt;p&gt;An &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; platform combining magneto-responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto-induced dynamic mechanical stimulation is developed for diabetic wound healing. It encapsulates fibroblasts and keratinocytes for superior wound closure, with enhanced cell proliferation, extracellular microenvironment production, and neo-vascularization, suggesting potential applicability to diabetic ulcer. Plus, leveraging scRNAseq data, a mechanosensitive fibroblast subpopulation is identified for further therapeutic impact.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic diabetic wounds are a significant global healthcare challenge. Current strategies, such as biomaterials, cell therapies, and medical devices, however, only target a few pathological features and have limited efficacy. A powerful platform technology combining magneto-responsive hydrogel, cells, and wireless magneto-induced dynamic mechanical stimulation (MDMS) is developed to accelerate diabetic wound healing. The hydrogel encapsulates U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved fibroblasts and keratinocytes to achieve &#8764;3-fold better wound closure in a diabetic mouse model. MDMS acts as a nongenetic mechano-rheostat to activate fibroblasts, resulting in &#8764;240% better proliferation, &#8764;220% more collagen deposition, and improved keratinocyte paracrine profiles via the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway to boost angiogenesis. The magneto-responsive property also enables on-demand insulin release for spatiotemporal glucose regulation through increasing network deformation and interstitial flow. By mining scRNAseq data, a mechanosensitive fibroblast subpopulation is identified that can be mechanically tuned for enhanced proliferation and collagen production, maximizing therapeutic impact. The &#8220;all-in-one&#8221; system addresses major pathological factors associated with diabetic wounds in a single platform, with potential applications for other challenging wound types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Based Regulation of Cellular Metabolism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of nanozymes in the metabolic regulation of diverse cells, including mammalian cells, microbial cells, and plant cells is reviewed, and the applications of nanozyme&#8208;based metabolic regulation in disease treatment, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture are highlighted. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the future research are discussed.








Abstract
Metabolism is the sum of the enzyme&#8208;dependent chemical reactions, which produces energy in catabolic process and synthesizes biomass in anabolic process, exhibiting high similarity in mammalian cell, microbial cell, and plant cell. Consequently, the loss or gain of metabolic enzyme activity greatly affects cellular metabolism. Nanozymes, as emerging enzyme mimics with diverse functions and adjustable catalytic activities, have shown attractive potential for metabolic regulation. Although the basic metabolic tasks are highly similar for the cells from different species, the concrete metabolic pathway varies with the intracellular structure of different species. Here, the basic metabolism in living organisms is described and the similarities and differences in the metabolic pathways among mammalian, microbial, and plant cells and the regulation mechanism are discussed. The recent progress on regulation of cellular metabolism mainly including nutrient uptake and utilization, energy production, and the accompanied redox reactions by different kinds of oxidoreductases and their applications in the field of disease therapy, antimicrobial therapy, and sustainable agriculture is systematically reviewed. Furthermore, the prospects and challenges of nanozymes in regulating cell metabolism are also discussed, which broaden their application scenarios.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Preparation for Multicolor Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Paper via Cellulose Heterogeneous Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile heterogeneous B&#9472;O covalent bonding strategy is developed to anchor arylboronic acid chromophores onto cellulose chains, using pure water as the solvent. A papermaking production line is built to convert paper pulp reacted with arylboronic acid additives to multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) paper on a large scale.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale preparation of sustainable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials, particularly those with stimulus&#8208;response properties, is attractive but remains challenging. This study develops a facile heterogeneous B&#9472;O covalent bonding strategy to anchor arylboronic acid chromophores to cellulose chains using pure water as a solvent, resulting in multicolor RTP cellulose. The rigid environment provided by the B&#9472;O covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds promotes the triplet population and suppresses quenching, leading to an excellent lifetime of 1.42 s for the target RTP cellulose. By increasing the degree of chromophore conjugation, the afterglow colors can be tuned from blue to green and then to red. Motivated by this finding, a papermaking production line is built to convert paper pulp reacted with an arylboronic acid additive into multicolor RTP paper on a large scale. Furthermore, the RTP paper is sensitive to water because of the destruction of hydrogen bonds, and the stimuli&#8208;response can be repeated in response to water/heat stimuli. The RTP paper can be folded into 3D afterglow origami handicrafts and anti&#8208;counterfeiting packing boxes or used for stimulus&#8208;responsive information encryption. This success paves the way for the development of large&#8208;scale, eco&#8208;friendly, and practical stimuli&#8208;responsive RTP materials.

         <title>Surface Chemistry of Biologically Active Reducible Oxide Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducible metal oxide nanoparticles are increasingly being studied for biomedical and therapeutic applications. These materials are able to accomplish a broad range of catalytic surface reactions, as well as being amenable to designed enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities as nanozymes. Here, physicochemical properties and material compositions informing optimal nanozyme activities by reducible metal oxide nanomaterials are considered.








Abstract
Reducible metal oxide nanozymes (rNZs) are a subject of intense recent interest due to their catalytic nature, ease of synthesis, and complex surface character. Such materials contain surface sites which facilitate enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions via substrate coordination and redox cycling. Further, these surface reactive sites are shown to be highly sensitive to stresses within the nanomaterial lattice, the physicochemical environment, and to processing conditions occurring as part of their syntheses. When administered in vivo, a complex protein corona binds to the surface, redefining its biological identity and subsequent interactions within the biological system. Catalytic activities of rNZs each deliver a differing impact on protein corona formation, its composition, and in turn, their recognition, and internalization by host cells. Improving the understanding of the precise principles that dominate rNZ surface&#8208;biomolecule adsorption raises the question of whether designer rNZs can be engineered to prevent corona formation, or indeed to produce &#8220;custom&#8221; protein coronas applied either in vitro, and preadministration, or formed immediately upon their exposure to body fluids. Here, fundamental surface chemistry processes and their implications in rNZ material performance are considered. In particular, material structures which inform component adsorption from the application environment, including substrates for enzyme&#8208;mimetic reactions are discussed.

         <title>Non&#8208;Linear Optics at Twist Interfaces in h&#8208;BN/SiC Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) thin films have been grown on silicon carbide substrates exhibiting strong non&#8208;linear second&#8208;harmonic generation and ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, attributed to the inherent formation of twisted nano&#8208;domain edges between the stacked h&#8208;BN nanocrystals with random in&#8208;plane orientations, as revealed by the first&#8208;principles time&#8208;dependent density functional theory.








Abstract
Understanding the emergent electronic structure in twisted atomically thin layers has led to the exciting field of twistronics. However, practical applications of such systems are challenging since the specific angular correlations between the layers must be precisely controlled and the layers have to be single crystalline with uniform atomic ordering. Here, an alternative, simple, and scalable approach is suggested, where nanocrystallinetwo&#8208;dimensional (2D) film on 3D substrates yields twisted&#8208;interface&#8208;dependent properties. Ultrawide&#8208;bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) thin films are directly grown on high in&#8208;plane lattice mismatched wide&#8208;bandgap silicon carbide (4H&#8208;SiC) substrates to explore the twist&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property correlations. Concurrently, nanocrystalline h&#8208;BN thin film shows strong non&#8208;linear second&#8208;harmonic generation and ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;plane thermal conductivity at room temperature, which are attributed to the twisted domain edges between van der Waals stacked nanocrystals with random in&#8208;plane orientations. First&#8208;principles calculations based on time&#8208;dependent density functional theory manifest strong even&#8208;order optical nonlinearity in twisted h&#8208;BN layers. This work unveils that directly deposited 2D nanocrystalline thin film on 3D substrates could provide easily accessible twist&#8208;interfaces, therefore enabling a simple and scalable approach to utilize the 2D&#8208;twistronics integrated in 3D material devices for next&#8208;generation nanotechnology.

         <title>Monodispersed Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Inorganic Cluster Chains in Polymers for Solid Electrolytes with Enhanced Li&#8208;Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of fully active Li+ conductive networks in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes is proposed by achieving monodispersion of sub&#8208;1 nm inorganic cluster chains in polymer matrix. 3D networks connected by monodispersed cluster chains eliminate the original defects of common inert fillers and build homogeneous, large&#8208;scale, continuous organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces.

The organic&#8211;inorganic interfaces can enhance Li+ transport in composite solid&#8208;state electrolytes (CSEs) due to the strong interface interactions. However, Li+ non&#8208;conductive areas in CSEs with inert fillers will hinder the construction of efficient Li+ transport channels. Herein, CSEs with fully active Li+ conductive networks are proposed to improve Li+ transport by composing sub&#8208;1&#160;nm inorganic cluster chains and organic polymer chains. The inorganic cluster chains are monodispersed in polymer matrix by a brief mixed&#8208;solvent strategy, their sub&#8208;1&#160;nm diameter and ultrafine dispersion state eliminate Li+ non&#8208;conductive areas in the interior of inert fillers and filler&#8208;agglomeration, respectively, providing rich surface areas for interface interactions. Therefore, the 3D networks connected by the monodispersed cluster chains finally construct homogeneous, large&#8208;scale, continuous Li+ fast transport channels. Furthermore, a conjecture about 1D oriented distribution of organic polymer chains along the inorganic cluster chains is proposed to optimize Li+ pathways. Consequently, the as&#8208;obtained CSEs possess high ionic conductivity at room temperature (0.52&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), high Li+ transference number (0.62), and more mobile Li+ (50.7%). The assembled LiFePO4/Li cell delivers excellent stability of 1000 cycles at 0.5&#160;C and 700 cycles at 1&#160;C. This research provides a new strategy for enhancing Li+ transport by efficient interfaces.

         <title>Recent Advances in Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based Energy Harvesting Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been of considerable interest for energy harvesting, due to their high gravimetric surface area and high thermal and electrical conductivities. In this review, the working principles, applications, and challenges of CNT&#8208;based nanogenerators based on electrochemical, hydroelectric, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and thermoelectric effects are introduced.








Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. Here, various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies are comprehensively reviewed, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

         <title>Spider Silk&#8208;Inspired Binder Design for Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery with High Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by spider silks, a binder for flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries is developed with &#946;&#8208;sheet nanocrystals and amorphous matrixes. The unique structure involves abundant reversible hydrogen bond arrays as well as cross&#8208;linked networks, resulting in excellent mechanical and bonding properties. The flexible batteries can maintain an integral electrode morphology and stable cycling during different tough deformations.








Abstract
The development of flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) imposes demands on energy density and high mechanical durability simultaneously. Due to the limited deformability of electrodes, as well as the flat and smooth surface of the metal current collectors, stable/durable/reliable contact between electrode materials and the current collectors remains a challenge, in particular, for electrodes with high loading mass and heavily deformed batteries. Binders play an essential role in binding particles of electrode materials and adhering them to current collectors. Herein, inspired by spider silk, a binder for flexible LIBs is developed, which equips a cross&#8208;linked supramolecular poly(urethane&#8208;urea) to the polyacrylic acid. The binder imparts super high elastic restorability originating from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments as well as extraordinary adhesion. The developed binder provides excellent flexibility and intact electrode morphologies without disintegration even when the electrode is largely deformed, enabling a stable cycling and voltage output even when the batteries are put under tough dynamic deformation tests. The flexible LIBs exhibit a high energy density of 420&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1, which is remarkably higher than reported numbers. The unique binder design is greatly promising and offers a valuable material solution for LIBs with high&#8208;loading mass and flexible designs.

         <title>Enhanced Resonance for Facilitated Modulation of Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Films with Stable Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hole transport material (HTM) based on N&#8208;C=O resonance structure is designed for modulation the crystallization and bottom&#8208;surface defects of perovskite films. Benefiting from the resonance interconversion (N&#8211;C=O and N+=C&#8211;O&#8722;) in HTM, the large&#8208;area inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) reach a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 21.0% with excellent photo&#8208;thermal stability.








Abstract
Upscaling efficient and stable perovskite films is a challenging task in the industrialization of perovskite solar cells partly due to the lack of high&#8208;performance hole transport materials (HTMs), which can simultaneously promote hole transport and regulate the quality of perovskite films especially in inverted solar cells. Here, a novel HTM based on N&#8211;C = O resonance structure is designed for facilitating the modulation of the crystallization and bottom&#8208;surface defects of perovskite films. Benefiting from the resonance interconversion (N&#8211;C = O and N+ = C&#8211;O&#8722;) in donor&#8208;resonance&#8208;donor (D&#8208;r&#8208;D) architecture and interactions with uncoordinated Pb2+ in perovskite, the resulting D&#8208;r&#8208;D HTM with two donor units exhibits not only excellent hole extraction and transport capacities, but also efficient crystallization modulation of perovskite for high&#8208;quality photovoltaic films in large area. The D&#8208;r&#8208;D HTM&#8208;based large&#8208;area (1.02 cm2) devices exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 21.0%. Moreover, the large&#8208;area devices have excellent photo&#8208;thermal stability, showing only a 2.6% reduction in PCE under continuous AM 1.5G light illumination at elevated temperature (&#8776;65&#160;&#176;C) for over 1320&#160;h without encapsulation.

         <title>Polymer Mechanochemistry in Microbubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating ultrasound&#8208;induced mechanochemical bond scission is realized by wrapping micron&#8208;sized gas bubbles in a mechanoresponsive polymer shell. Disulfide mechanophore is able to be activated using a shorter time in this system than common mechanochemical approach. This strategy promises a new pathway to implement polymer mechanochemistry, which might be beneficial for developments in the field of sonopharmacology.








Abstract
Polymer mechanochemistry is a promising technology to convert mechanical energy into chemical functionality by breaking covalent and supramolecular bonds site&#8208;selectively. Yet, the mechanochemical reaction rates of covalent bonds in typically used ultrasonication setups lead to reasonable conversions only after comparably long sonication times. This can be accelerated by either increasing the reactivity of the mechanoresponsive moiety or by modifying the encompassing polymer topology. Here, a microbubble system with a tailored polymer shell consisting of an N2 gas core and a mechanoresponsive disulfide&#8208;containing polymer network is presented. It is found that the mechanochemical activation of the disulfides is greatly accelerated using these microbubbles compared to commensurate solid core particles or capsules filled with liquid. Aided by computational simulations, it is found that low shell thickness, low shell stiffness and crosslink density, and a size&#8208;dependent eigenfrequency close to the used ultrasound frequency maximize the mechanochemical yield over the course of the sonication process.

         <title>Skyrmion&#8208;Bubble Bundles in an X&#8208;Type Sr2Co2Fe28O46 Hexaferrite above Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study showcases the successful formation of skyrmion&#8208;bubble bundles, which are comprised of multiple skyrmions and/or bubbles enclosed within a closed stripe domain. These bundles exhibit unique characteristics, including stability at room temperature, flexibility in the arrangement of internal skyrmions and bubbles, and field&#8208;controlled topological magnetic transformations, and promote the advancement of multi&#8208;Q topological spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are spin swirls that possess topological nontriviality and are considered particle&#8208;like entities. They are distinguished by an integer topological charge Q. The presence of skyrmion bundles provides an opportunity to explore the range of values for Q, which is crucial for the advancement of topological spintronic devices with multi&#8208;Q properties. In this study, a new material candidate, Sr2Co2Fe28O46 hexaferrite of the X&#8208;type, which hosts small dipolar skyrmions at room temperature and above is presented. By exploiting reversed magnetic fields from metastable skyrmion bubbles at zero fields,&#160;skyrmion&#8208;bubble bundles with different interior skyrmion/bubble numbers, topological charges, and morphologies at room temperature are incorporated. These experimental findings are consistently supported by micromagnetic simulations. These results highlight the versatility of topological spin textures in centrosymmetric uniaxial magnets, thereby paving the way for the development of room&#8208;temperature topological spintronic devices with multi&#8208;Q characteristics.

         <title>The One&#8208;Stop Integrated Nanoagent Based on Photothermal Therapy for Deep Infection Healing and Inflammation Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chronic wounds caused by bacterial infections have become a major challenge in the medical field. Hypoxia condition in the chronic wound area extremely induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and up&#8208;regulates the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor (HIF&#8208;1&#945;), both of which can enhance the production of pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 subtype macrophages while reducing the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 subtype macrophages. Besides, the bacteria&#8208;formed biofilms in the chronic wound area also hinder the penetration of therapeutic agents. Encouraged by the natural motors automatically executing tasks, we hypothesize that supplying sufficient oxygen (O2) would simultaneously drive therapeutic agent movement, rescue the hypoxic microenvironment, and disrupt the vicious cycle of inflammation. Here, we develop small organic molecule&#8208;based nanoparticles (2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs) that possess high photothermal conversion efficiency and enzymatic activities, including superoxide dismutase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activity. 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs exhibit superior ROS scavenging and O2 production abilities in synergistically relieving inflammatory microenvironment and deep penetration of 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs in the chronic wound tissues. By combining the photothermal property, 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs can effectively eliminate bacteria in biofilms to promote wound healing. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis and in vivo experiments further demonstrate that 2TT-mC6B@Cu5.4O NPs effectively inhibit biological activities inside bacteria and alleviate hypoxia in deep tissue infections.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reconstruction of Highly Degraded LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 Towards Stable Single&#8208;Crystalline Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing demand for resources sustainability has promoted the recycle of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to a strategic position. Direct recycle outperforms either hydrometallurgical or pyrometallurgical approaches due to the high added value and facile treatment processes. However, the traditional direct recycling technologies are only applicable for Ni&#8208;poor/middle cathodes. Herein, we directly recycle of spent Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (S&#8208;NCM) to performance&#8208;enhanced single&#8208;crystalline cathode materials using a simple but effective LiOH&#8208;NaCl molten salt. We systematically investigate the evolution process of the Li&#8208;supplement and grain&#8208;recrystallization during regeneration, and comprehensively prove the successful recovery of the highly degraded microstructure, including significant elimination of Ni2+ and O vacancies. Beneficial from the favorable reconstructed single&#8208;crystalline particles, the regenerated NCM (R&#8208;NCM) represents remarkably enhanced structural stability, electrochemical activity, O2 and cracks suppression during charge/discharge, thus achieving the excellent performances in long&#8208;term cycling and high&#8208;rate tests. As a result, R&#8208;NCM maintains the 86.5% reversible capacity at 1C after 200 cycles. Instructively, the present molten salt can be successfully applied for recycling spent NCMs with various Li and Ni compositions (e.g., LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2).

         <title>Visible&#8208;Light Communication with Lighting: Rgb Wavelength Division Multiplexing OLEDs/OPDs Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A multichannel/multicolor visible light communication (VLC) system using entirely organic components, including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs), is developed to demonstrate indoor lighting applications where the integration of OLEDs and OPDs has significant potential. To achieve this, tricolor (R/G/B)&#8208;selective OPD arrays for the receiver and tricolor OLED arrays for the emitter are developed. For (R/G/B)&#8208;selective OPDs, a Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot electrode structure to enhance color selectivity and a thick junction structure to effectively accommodate a wide range of driving voltages are introduced. For tricolor OLEDs, fluorescent&#8208;emitting materials are used to enhance the operating frequency in addition to introducing a cavity structure to achieve narrow emission. Utilizing these spectrally refined tricolor OPDs/OLEDs, a VLC system is designed for indoor lighting applications, and a systematic analysis of their signal&#8208;to&#8208;interference ratio dependence on the distance or angle between the transmitter and receiver is performed. The study's findings indicate the importance of emission angle&#8208;dependent wavelength shift of the OLED and the luminosity function, which varies with wavelength, in the R/G/B mixed&#8208;white&#8208;light&#8208;based VLC systems. Finally, the feasibility of VLC using tricolor OPDs/OLEDs in the real&#8208;life context of indoor white&#8208;color lighting is demonstrated, showing that the transmitted data patterns well&#8208;matched the received data patterns.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Independent Synchronized Ros Generation and Hypoxia Prodrug Activation with Z&#8208;Scheme Heterostructure Sonosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Combination therapy has emerged as a promising approach for effective tumor treatment. However, the combination of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and hypoxia&#8208;activated prodrugs (HAPs) has not been explored due to the contradictory requirement of oxygen (O2) for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the necessity to avoid O2 for the activation of HAPs. In this study, we address this challenge by developing BiOCl&#8208;Au&#8208;Ag2S Z&#8208;scheme heterostructure nanoparticles loaded with tirapazamine (TPZ) to achieve O2&#8208;independent therapy. These nanoparticles demonstrate efficient electron&#8208;hole separation under ultrasound irradiation while maintaining a high redox potential. The generated holes react with water to efficiently produce hydroxyl radicals, while the electrons autonomously activate TPZ, negating the need for O2. In vitro and in vivo assessments validate the effective tumor elimination by these Z&#8208;scheme nanoparticles without disrupting the hypoxic environment. This innovative design overcomes the limitations associated with O2 requirement in SDT and introduces a novel strategy for HAP activation and synergistic therapy between ROS and HAP&#8208;based therapy.

         <title>A Janus&#8208;Ros Healing System Promoting Infectious Bone Regeneration via Sono&#8208;Epigenetic Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Elimination of bacterial infections and simultaneously promoting osteogenic differentiation are highly required for infectious bone diseases. Massive reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage cells, while low ROS concentrations as a molecular signal can regulate cellular fate. In this study, we develop a Janus&#8208;ROS healing system for infectious bone regeneration. An alendronate (ALN)&#8208;mediated defective metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) sonosensitizer is prepared, which can effectively clear Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections and promote osteogenic differentiation under differential ultrasonic irradiation. In the presence of zirconium&#8211;phosphate coordination, the ALN&#8208;mediated porphyrin&#8208;based MOF (HN25) with a proper defect has great sonodynamic antibacterial efficiency (98.97%, 15&#160;min) and bone targeting ability. Notably, under low power ultrasound irradiation, HN25 can increase the chromatin accessibility of ossification&#8208;related genes and FOXO1 to promote bone repair through low ROS concentrations. Animal models of paravertebral infection, fracture with infection, and osteomyelitis demonstrate that HN25 successfully realizes the targeted and potent repair of various infectious bone tissues through rapid MRSA elimination, inhibiting osteoclast activity and promoting bone regeneration. Our results show that high catalytic efficiency and bioactive MOF can be constructed using pharmaceutical&#8208;mediated defect engineering. The Janus&#8208;ROS treatment is also a promising therapeutic mode for infectious tissue regeneration.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hydrogen Production from Alkaline/Seawater Over a Single Step Synthesis of Mo3se4&#8208;Nise Core&#8208;Shell Nanowire Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The rational design and steering of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen generation is highly desirable but challenging with catalysts free of platinum group metals (PGMs). Mass production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen fuel from seawater electrolysis presents a transformative technology for sustainable alternatives. Here, we report a heterostructure of molybdenum selenide&#8208;nickel selenide (Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe) core&#8208;shell nanowire arrays constructed on nickel foam by a single&#8208;step in situ hydrothermal process. This tiered structure provides improved intrinsic activity and high electrical conductivity for efficient charge transfer and endows excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity in alkaline and natural seawater conditions. The Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe freestanding electrodes require small overpotentials of 84.4 and 166&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and natural seawater electrolytes, respectively. It maintained an impressive balance between electrocatalytic activity and stability. Experimental and theoretical calculations revealed that the Mo3Se4&#8208;NiSe interface provides abundant active sites for the HER process, which modulate the binding energies of adsorbed species and decrease the energetic barrier, providing a new route to design state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, PGM&#8208;free catalysts for hydrogen production from alkaline and seawater electrolysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxidation Resistance of the Curved Surface of Achromatic Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of achromatic Cu films with semi&#8208;permanent stability and switchable superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic states on rough or curved surfaces is realized by an innovative strategy. Comprehensive atomic&#8208;resolution microscopy reveals that their surfaces are of a series of monoatomic steps and have a counterintuitive lattice contraction, which demonstrates the self&#8208;oxidation resistance of copper.








Abstract
Copper surfaces that exhibit a wide range of achromatic colors while still metallic have not been studied, despite advancements in antireflection coatings. A series of achromatic copper films grown with [111] preferred orientation by depositing 3D&#160;porous nanostructures is introduced via coherent/incoherent atomic sputtering epitaxy. The porous copper nanostructures self&#8208;regulate the giant oxidation resistance by constructing a curved surface that generates a series of monoatomic steps, followed by shrinkage of the lattice spacing of one or two surface layers. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm that these structural components cooperatively increase the energy barrier against oxygen penetration. The achromaticity of the single&#8208;crystalline porous copper films is systematically tuned by geometrical parameters such as pore size distribution and 3D linkage. The optimized achromatic copper films with high oxidation resistance show an unusual switching effect between superhydrophilicity and superhydrophobicity. The tailored 3D porous nanostructures can be a candidate material&#160;for numerous applications, such as antireflection coatings, microfluidic devices, droplet tweezers, and reversible wettability switches.

         <title>Optically Active MXenes in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene&#8208;based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have recently gained tremendous attention as prospective optical materials that combine an extraordinary optical response with tunable light&#8211;matter interactions. This Perspective puts the spotlight on MXenes as facile 2D building blocks to design vertical MXene/2D assemblies. Further exploration of MXene/2D vdW heterostructures is encouraged since they can crosscut the current limitations of light utilization.








Abstract
The vertical integration of distinct 2D materials in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provides the opportunity for interface engineering and modulation of electronic as well as optical properties. However, scarce experimental studies reveal many challenges for vdW heterostructures, hampering the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic and optical functionalities. Optically active MXenes, the most recent member of the 2D family, with excellent hydrophilicity, rich surface chemistry, and intriguing optical properties, are a novel 2D platform for optoelectronics applications. Coupling MXenes with various 2D materials into vdW heterostructures can open new avenues for the exploration of physical phenomena of novel quantum&#8208;confined nanostructures and devices. Therefore, the fundamental basis and recent findings in vertical vdW heterostructures composed of MXenes as a primary component and other 2D materials as secondary components are examined. Their robust designs and synthesis approaches that can push the boundaries of light&#8208;harvesting, transition, and utilization are discussed, since MXenes provide a unique playground for pursuing an extraordinary optical response or unusual light conversion features/functionalities. The recent findings are finally summarized, and a perspective for the future development of next&#8208;generation vdW multifunctional materials enriched by MXenes is provided.

         <title>In Situ Li&#8208;Plating Diagnosis for Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Relaxation&#8208;Time Detection</title>

         <dc:description>
An effective indicator of Li&#8208;plating onset is urgently needed to investigate the safety window of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This work demonstrates that the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process is promising for determining Li&#8208;plating onset. A relaxation&#8208;time detection method is proposed, allowing in situ diagnosis of the Li&#8208;plating behavior in fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;plating behavior of Li&#8208;ion batteries under fast&#8208;charging conditions is elusive due to a lack of reliable indicators of the Li&#8208;plating onset. In this work, the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process (&#964;CT) is proposed to be promising for the determination of Li&#8208;plating onset. A novel pulse/relaxation test method enables rapid access to the &#964;CT of the graphite anode during battery operation, applicable to both half and full batteries. The diagnosis of Li plating at varying temperatures and charging rates enriches the cognition of Li&#8208;plating behaviors. Li plating at low temperatures and high charging rates can be avoided because of the battery voltage limitations. Nevertheless, after the onset, severe Li plating evolves rapidly under harsh charging conditions, while the Li&#8208;plating process under benign charging conditions is accompanied by a simultaneous Li&#8208;intercalation process. The quantitative estimates indicate that Li plating at high temperatures/high charging rates leads to more irreversible capacity losses. This facile method with rational scientific principles can provide inspiration for exploring the safe boundaries of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Se Nanopowder Conversion into Lubricious 2D Selenide Layers by Tribochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple sprinkling of Se nanopowders onto sliding Mo and W thin films leads to the tribochemical in operando formation of lubricious 2D selenides. Due to the thermal and vacuum stability of the Se nanopowders they can be used to replenish sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of transition metal dichalcogenidelubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS2, even though selenides and tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, an innovative in operando conversion of Se nanopowders into lubricious 2D selenides, by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces coated with Mo and W thin films, is described. Advanced material characterization confirms the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in the shear&#8208;induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nanopowders. The use of Se nanopowder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nanopowder with the transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of TMD&#8208;lubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs in operando and exploit their friction&#8208; and wear&#8208;reducing impact.

         <title>Rational Design of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient and Durable Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles, derived from two&#8208;step pyrolysis of ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, exhibit highly efficient and durable catalytic performance for photothermal hydrogenation of CO2. As verified by experimental observations and theoretical simulations, such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively promote the desorption of CO and activation of CO2 and H2 molecules due to the strong photothermal effect.








Abstract
Photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and durable catalysts. Here, the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles (NPs), as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two&#8208;step pyrolysis of Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, is reported. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of these Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers, and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>Redox Triggers Guest Release and Uptake Across a Series of Azopyridine&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Capsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active azo groups are introduced in replacement of imine bonds that have been previously utilized to construct metal&#8211;organic capsules, endowing the capsules with reversible redox behaviors that can release guests upon reduction and re&#8208;capsulate them through oxidation. Since azo groups can attach to various ligand cores, this can potentially be a general approach to realize guest release and uptake via redox.








Abstract
Precise control over guest release and recapture using external stimuli is a valuable goal, potentially enabling new modes of chemical purification. Including redox moieties within the ligand cores of molecular capsules to trigger the release and uptake of guests has proved effective, but this technique is limited to certain capsules and guests. Herein, the construction of a series of novel metal&#8211;organic capsules from ditopic, tritopic, and tetratopic ligands is demonstrated, all of which contain redox&#8208;active azo groups coordinated to FeII centers. Compared to their iminopyridine&#8208;based analogs, this new class of azopyridine&#8208;based capsules possesses larger cavities, capable of encapsulating more voluminous guests. Upon reduction of the capsules, their guests are released and may then be re&#8208;encapsulated when the capsules are regenerated by oxidation. Since the redox centers are on the ligand arms, they are modular and can be attached to a variety of ligand cores to afford varying and predictable architectures. This method thus shows promise as a generalized approach for designing redox&#8208;controlled guest release and uptake systems.

         <title>Polyhedron&#8208;Like Biomaterials for Innervated and Vascularized Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by space&#8208;filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. The polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds exhibit satisfactory effects on stimulating osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in vitro, and achieving good innervated and vascularized bone regeneration in vivo.








Abstract
Neural&#8208;vascular networks are densely distributed through periosteum, cortical bone, and cancellous bone, which is of great significance for bone regeneration and remodeling. Although significant progress has been made in bone tissue engineering, ineffective bone regeneration, and delayed osteointegration still remains an issue due to the ignorance of intrabony nerves and blood vessels. Herein, inspired by space&#8208;filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via 3D&#8208;printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. Benefiting from its spatial topologies, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds greatly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via activating PI3K&#8208;Akt signals, and exhibiting satisfactory performance on angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation elucidates that polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds have a relatively lower area&#8208;weighted average static pressure, which is beneficial to osteogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments further demonstrate that polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds obviously promote bone formation and osteointegration, as well as inducing vascularization and ingrowth of nerves, leading to innervated and vascularized bone regeneration. Taken together, this work offers a promising approach for fabricating multifunctional scaffolds without additional exogenous seeding cells and growth factors, which holds great potential for functional tissue regeneration and further clinical translation.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by space-filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron-like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via Digital Light Processing (DLP)-based 3D-printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. The polyhedron-like scaffolds exhibit satisfactory effects on stimulating osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in vitro, and achieving good innervated and vascularized bone regeneration in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural-vascular networks are densely distributed through periosteum, cortical bone, and cancellous bone, which is of great significance for bone regeneration and remodeling. Although significant progress has been made in bone tissue engineering, ineffective bone regeneration, and delayed osteointegration still remains an issue due to the ignorance of intrabony nerves and blood vessels. Herein, inspired by space-filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron-like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via 3D-printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. Benefiting from its spatial topologies, polyhedron-like scaffolds greatly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via activating PI3K-Akt signals, and exhibiting satisfactory performance on angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation elucidates that polyhedron-like scaffolds have a relatively lower area-weighted average static pressure, which is beneficial to osteogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments further demonstrate that polyhedron-like scaffolds obviously promote bone formation and osteointegration, as well as inducing vascularization and ingrowth of nerves, leading to innervated and vascularized bone regeneration. Taken together, this work offers a promising approach for fabricating multifunctional scaffolds without additional exogenous seeding cells and growth factors, which holds great potential for functional tissue regeneration and further clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight on the Intracellular Supramolecular Assembly of DTTO: A Peculiar Example of Cell&#8208;Driven Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within live cells, DTTO molecules form amorphous spherical clusters which subsequently accumulate, coalesce, and lead to the formation of fibrous crystals interconnecting different cells. Remarkably, cells produce a distinctive crystalline form, that is, a bio&#8208;polymorph, which cannot be replicated outside cells. These fibers offer a new approach for artificially connecting cells and hold the potential for creating/regenerating cellular communication networks.








Abstract
The assembly of supramolecular structures within living systems is an innovative approach for introducing artificial constructs and developing biomaterials capable of influencing and/or regulating the biological responses of living organisms. By integrating chemical, photophysical, morphological, and structural characterizations, it is&#160;shown that the cell&#8208;driven assembly of 2,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;4,4&#8208;dioxide (DTTO) molecules into fibers results in the formation of a &#8220;biologically assisted&#8221; polymorphic form, hence the term bio&#8208;polymorph. Indeed, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that cell&#8208;grown DTTO fibers present a unique molecular packing leading to specific morphological, optical, and electrical properties. Monitoring the process of fiber formation in cells with time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, it is&#160;established that cellular machinery is necessary for fiber production and a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism for their growth is postulated. These biomaterials may have disruptive applications in the stimulation and sense of living cells, but more crucially, the study of their genesis and properties broadens the&#160;understanding of life beyond the native components of cells.

         <title>High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Li&#8211;S Batteries Catalytically Activated by Cerium Oxide: Performance and Failure Analysis under Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D sulfur electrode with cotton&#8208;derived carbon as the substrate and CeOx as the catalyst is developed to achieve high sulfur mass loading and fast reaction kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The resulting Li&#8211;S cell is found to fail after 100&#8211;200 cycles during charging due to local short circuiting caused by Li dendrites penetrating the separator.








Abstract
Increasing sulfur mass loading and minimizing electrolyte amount remains a major challenge for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries, which needs to be tackled with combined efforts of materials development and mechanistic analysis. This work, following the same team's most recent identification of the potential&#8208;limiting step of Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions, seeks to advance the understanding by extending it to a new catalyst and into the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;mass&#8208;loading region. CeOx nanostructures are integrated into cotton&#8208;derived carbon to develop a multifunctional 3D network that can host a large amount of active material, facilitate electron transport, and catalyze the sulfur lithiation reaction. The resulting S/CeOx/C electrode can deliver a stable areal capacity of 9&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a high sulfur loading of 14&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mg&#8722;1. This study discovers that Li||S/CeOx/C cells usually fail during charging at high current density, as a consequence of local short circuiting caused by electrochemically deposited Li dendrites penetrating through the separator, a previously overlooked failure pattern distinctive to cells operating under lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the importance of developing new material structures and analyzing failure mechanisms in the advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Templating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerogel production methodology through freezing and lyophilization of engineerable liquid templates, generated via interfacial complexation through electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles (NPs) and ligands, is introduced. The coined approach enables tuning of the multiscale porosities, 3D architecture, and characteristics of the aerogels by engineering the composition and arrangement of liquid templates toward advanced applications and functions.








Abstract
Modern materials science has witnessed the era of advanced fabrication methods to engineer functionality from the nano&#8208; to macroscales. Versatile fabrication and additive manufacturing methods are developed, but the ability to design a material for a given application is still limited. Here,&#160;a novel strategy that enables target&#8208;oriented manufacturing of ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels with on&#8208;demand characteristics is introduced. The process relies on controllable liquid templating through interfacial complexation to generate tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;structured (multiphase) filamentous liquid templates. The methodology involves nanoscale chemistry and microscale assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to produce hierarchical macroscopic aerogels featuring multiscale porosity, ultralow density (3.05&#8211;3.41&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and high compressibility (90%) combined with elastic resilience and instant shape recovery. The challenges are overcome facing ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels, including poor mechanical integrity and the inability to form predefined 3D constructs with on&#8208;demand functionality, for a multitude of applications. The controllable nature of the coined methodology enables tunable electromagnetic interference shielding with high specific shielding effectiveness (39 893&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1), and one of the highest&#8208;ever reported oil&#8208;absorption capacities (487 times the initial weight of aerogel for chloroform), to be obtained. These properties originate from the engineerable nature of liquid templating, pushing the boundaries of lightweight materials to systematic function design and applications.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering of Conformal 2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method, prepared robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath 3D perovskite enable the formation of a conformal 2D/3D heterostructure at the buried interface. Owing to the influence of the heterojunction on crystallization and interfacial modulation, perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem solar cells based on industrially fully textured silicon achieve an efficiency of 29.8% (certified 28.4%).








Abstract
Exploring strategies to control the crystallization and modulate interfacial properties for high&#8208;quality perovskite film on industry&#8208;relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells is highly valued in the perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics community. The formation of a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution&#8208;processed heterostructures at the buried interface faces solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying&#8208;layer disruption, and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method is used to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits by way of preferred crystal growth of strain&#8208;free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect&#8208;induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge&#8208;carrier extraction with ideal energy&#8208;level alignment. The broad applicability of the bottom&#8208;contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion are&#160;demonstrated. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells, based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon, achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1000 h operation.

However, realizing solution-processed heterostructures at the buried interface faces solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying-layer disruption, and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, a hybrid two-step deposition method is used to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross-linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits by way of preferred crystal growth of strain-free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect-induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge-carrier extraction with ideal energy-level alignment. The broad applicability of the bottom-contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion are&#160;demonstrated. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells, based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon, achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1000 h operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chiroptical Response Inversion and Enhancement of Room&#8208;Temperature Exciton&#8208;Polaritons Using 2D Chirality in Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8211;matter interaction between a 2D chiroptical film and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is investigated. The chiroptical response inversion of the 2D chiroptical film shall be ideally suited to the circularly polarized light switching feature in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity, resulting in the enhancement effect in the chiroptical signal.








Abstract
Although chiral semiconductors have shown promising progress in direct circularly polarized light (CPL) detection and emission, they still face potential challenges. A chirality&#8208;switching mechanism or approach integrating two enantiomers is needed to discriminate the handedness of a given CPL; additionally, a large material volume is required for sufficient chiroptical interaction. These two requirements pose significant obstacles to the simplification and miniaturization of the devices. Here, room&#8208;temperature chiral polaritons fulfilling dual&#8208;handedness functions and exhibiting a more&#8208;than&#8208;two&#8208;order enhancement of the chiroptical signal are demonstrated, by embedding a 40 nm&#8208;thick perovskite film with a 2D&#160;chiroptical effect into a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. By mixing chiral perovskites with different crystal structures, a pronounced 2D&#160;chiroptical effect is accomplished in the perovskite film, featured by an inverted chiroptical response for counter&#8208;propagating CPL. This inversion behavior matches the photonic handedness switch during CPL circulation in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot&#160;cavity, thus harvesting giant enhancement of the chiroptical response. Furthermore, affected by the unique quarter&#8208;wave&#8208;plate effects, the polariton emission achieves a chiral dissymmetry of &#177;4% (for the emission from the front and the back sides). The room&#8208;temperature polaritons with the strong dissymmetric chiroptical interaction shall have implications on a fundamental level and future on&#8208;chip applications for biomolecule analysis and quantum computing.

         <title>Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic&#8208;Scale Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle atomic&#8208;scale structural modulations of a crystal can dramatically change its optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal plates of modulated quasi&#8208;1D chalcogenide Sr9/8TiS3 are shown to have a record in&#8208;plane birefringence &#916;n = ne &#8722; no = 2.1 (ne = 4.5,&#8197;no = 2.4) within a broad transparent window in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. Structural modulation will be a new tool in realizing materials with large degrees of optical and optoelectronic anisotropy.








Abstract
Materials with large birefringence (&#916;n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light&#8211;matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D&#160;materials can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure&#8212;Sr9/8TiS3&#8212;is transparent and positive&#8208;uniaxial, with extraordinary index ne = 4.5 and ordinary index no = 2.4 in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal&#8208;prismatic units that break the chains of face&#8208;sharing TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive&#8208;index modulation.

         <title>An Ultrahighly Stretchable and Recyclable Starch&#8208;Based Gel with Multiple&#160;Functions</title>

         <dc:description>
A starch&#8208;based ADM gel with high stretchability, swiftly self&#8208;healing ability, self&#8208;adhesive property, freezing resistance, moisturizing properties, and satisfactory sensing performance is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. The ADM gel with reversible hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions can be recycled by the &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and the &#8220;dissolution&#8211;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively.








Abstract
With the development of various gel&#8208;based flexible sensors, novel gels with multiple integrated and efficient properties, particularly recyclability, have been developed. Herein, a starch&#8208;based ADM (amylopectin (AP)&#8211;poly(3&#8208;[dimethyl&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208; enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (PDMAPS)&#8211;MXene) gel is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. Reversible crosslinking in the gel occurs through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The ADM gel exhibits high stretchability (&#8776;2700%, after one month), swift self&#8208;healing performance, self&#8208;adhesive properties, favorable freezing resistance, and satisfactory moisturizing properties (&#8805;30&#160;days). Interestingly, the ADM gel can be recycled and reused by a &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and &#8220;dissolution&#8211;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively. Furthermore, the ADM gel can be assembled as a strain sensor with a broad working strain range (&#8776;800%) and quick response time (response time 211&#160;ms and recovery time 253&#160;ms, under 10% strain) to detect various macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;human&#8208;motions, even under harsh conditions such as pronunciation and handwriting. The ADM gel can also be used as a humidity sensor to investigate humidity and human respiratory status, suggesting its practical application in personal health management. This study provides a novel strategy for the preparation of high&#8208;performance recycled gels and flexible sensors.

Mimicking ion channeling and neuron signaling, synthesis of artificial K+&#8208;selective membrane, and its integration with the hydrogel&#8208;based ionic device are demonstrated, achieving K+&#8208;selective ion&#8208;to&#8208;ion amplification in complex biomixtures. The membrane exclusively allows K+ transport without water leakage; it is 250&#215; and 17&#215; more permeable toward K+ than Cl&#8722; and NMDG+, respectively, and permits a 500% larger K+ signal than Li+.








Abstract
Living cells efflux intracellular ions for maintaining cellular life, so intravital measurements of specific ion signals are of significant importance for studying cellular functions and pharmacokinetics. In this work, de novo synthesis of artificial K+&#8208;selective membrane and its integration with polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;based open&#8208;junction ionic diode (OJID) is demonstrated, achieving a real&#8208;time K+&#8208;selective ion&#8208;to&#8208;ion current amplification in complex bioenvironments. By mimicking biological K+ channels and nerve impulse transmitters, in&#8208;line K+&#8208;binding G&#8208;quartets are introduced across freestanding lipid bilayers by G&#8208;specific hexylation of monolithic G&#8208;quadruplex, and the pre&#8208;filtered K+ flow is directly converted to amplified ionic currents by the OJID with a fast response time at 100&#160;ms intervals. By the synergistic combination of charge repulsion, sieving, and ion recognition, the synthetic membrane allows K+ transport exclusively without water leakage; it is 250&#215; and 17&#215; more permeable toward K+ than monovalent anion, Cl&#8722;, and polyatomic cation, N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucamine+, respectively. The molecular recognition&#8208;mediated ion channeling provides a 500% larger signal for K+ as compared to Li+ (0.6&#215; smaller than K+) despite the same valence. Using the miniaturized device, non&#8208;invasive, direct, and real&#8208;time K+ efflux monitoring from living cell spheroids is achieved with minimal crosstalk, specifically in identifying osmotic shock&#8208;induced necrosis and drug&#8208;antidote dynamics.

         <title>Protonated Organic Semiconductors: Origin of Water&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Trap Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism of bias&#8208;stress&#8208;induced trap generation in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is unveiled. The combined spectroscopic method proposes the trap generation from the protonation of low&#8208;bandgap polymers. This concept can be applied to promote the development of highly stable OFETs under bias stress and related application devices.








Abstract
Despite dramatic improvements in the electronic characteristics of organic semiconductors, the low operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) hinders their direct use in practical applications. Although the literature contains numerous reports on the effects of water on the operational stability of OFETs, the underlying mechanisms of trap generation induced by water remain unclear. Here, a protonation&#8208;induced trap generation of organic semiconductors is proposed as a possible origin of the operational instability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Spectroscopic and electronic investigation techniques combined with simulations reveal that the direct protonation of organic semiconductors by water during operation may be responsible for the trap generation induced by bias stress; this phenomenon is independent of the trap generation at an insulator surface. In addition, the same feature occurred in small&#8208;bandgap polymers with fused thiophene rings irrespective of their crystalline ordering, implying the generality of protonation induced trap generation in various polymer semiconductors with a small bandgap. The finding of the trap&#8208;generation process provides new perspectives for achieving greater operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>Non&#8208;Pore Dependent and MMP&#8208;9 Responsive Gelatin/Silk Fibroin Composite Microparticles as Universal Delivery Platform for Inhaled Treatment of Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
GSC with adjusted particle sizes is fabricated through the microphase separation of gelatin (Gel) /silk fibroin (SF) systems and following desolvation process. This work specifically selects GSC with a diameter of 3 &#181;m as carriers for various drugs including small molecule chemotherapeutics, large protein drugs, and nucleic acid drugs for noninvasive aerosol inhalation therapy for lung cancer.








Abstract
Developing a drug delivery platform that possesses universal drug loading capacity to meet various requirements of cancer treatment is a challenging yet interesting task. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled gelatin/silk fibroin composite (GSC) particle based drug delivery system is developed via microphase separation followed by desolvation process. Thanks to its preassembled microphase stage, this GSC system is suitable for varying types of drugs. The desolvation process fix drugs inside GSC rapidly and densify the GSC structure, thereby achieving efficient drug loading and providing comprehensive protection for loaded drugs. Actually, the size of this brand&#8208;new non&#8208;pore dependent drug delivery system can be easily adjusted from 100&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m to fit different scenarios. This work selects GSC with 3&#160;&#181;m diameter as the universal inhaled drug delivery platform, which shows an excellent transmucosal penetration and lung retention ability. Additionally, the MMP&#8208;9 sensitive degradation property of GSC enhances the targeted efficiency of drugs and reduces side effects. Intestinally, GSC can self&#8208;amplify the regulation of innate immunity to reverse the cancerous microenvironment into an antitumor niche, significantly improving the therapeutic effect of drugs. This study of GSC universal drug platform provides a new direction to develop the next&#8208;generation of drug delivery system for lung cancer.

         <title>Reinforcing Hydrogel by Nonsolvent&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Facilitated In&#160;Situ Nanofibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative nanofibrous hydrogel (nf&#8208;gel) constructed with constituent polymer nanofibers is proposed and fabricated using a two&#8208;step solvent&#8208;exchange method including an essential nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step. These nf&#8208;gels show remarkably enhanced mechanical properties and swelling resistance compared to their molecular counterparts. Particularly, they are isotropic, distinctly different from conventional fiber reinforced hydrogels.. .








Abstract
Nanofibrous hydrogels are pervasive in load&#8208;bearing soft tissues, which are believed to be key to their extraordinary mechanical properties. Enlighted by this phenomenon, a novel reinforcing strategy for polymeric hydrogels is proposed, where polymer segments in the hydrogels are induced to form nanofibers in&#160;situ by bolstering their controllable aggregation at the nanoscale level. Poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are chosen to demonstrate the virtue of this strategy. A nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step is introduced into the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogel preparation approach, which readily promotes the formation of nanofibrous hydrogels in the following solvent&#8208;tempering process. The resultant nanofibrous hydrogels demonstrate significantly improved mechanical properties and swelling resistance, compared to the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogels with identical compositions. This work validates the hypothesis that bundling polymer chains to form nanofibers can lead to nanofibrous hydrogels with remarkably enhanced mechanical performances, which may open a new horizon for single&#8208;component hydrogel reinforcement.

         <title>A Nanoconfined Water&#8211;Ion Coordination Network for Flexible Energy&#8208;Dissipation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment can significantly promote the interaction between ions and water molecules. Such a strong interaction&#160;facilitates the formation of ion clusters and limits particle dynamics. Based on this mechanism, a liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system capable of providing flexible protection to personnel and devices and instrumentations against mechanical impacts and attacks is designed.








Abstract
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment that deeply constrains spatial freedoms of local atomistic motion with unconventional coupling mechanisms beyond that in a free, bulk state is essential to spark designs of a broad spectrum of nanofluidic devices with unique properties and functionalities. Here, it is&#160;reported that the interaction between ions and water molecules in a hydrophobic nanopore forms a coordination network with an interaction density that is nearly fourfold that of the bulk counterpart. Such strong interaction facilitates the connectivity of the water&#8211;ion network and is uncovered by corroborating the formation of ion clusters and the reduction of particle dynamics. A liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system is designed and demonstrated in both molecular simulations and experiments that the formed coordination network controls the outflow of confined electrolytes along with a pressure reduction, capable of providing flexible protection for personnel and devices and instrumentations against external mechanical impact and attack.

A liquid-nanopore energy-dissipation system is designed and demonstrated in both molecular simulations and experiments that the formed coordination network controls the outflow of confined electrolytes along with a pressure reduction, capable of providing flexible protection for personnel and devices and instrumentations against external mechanical impact and attack.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Cu&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Electrochemical Reduction of Acetylene to Ethylene at Low&#8208;Concentrations with Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for the electrochemical reduction of acetylene at low concentrations. The electrocatalysts promote acetylene activation whilst suppressing hydrogen evolution and ethylene hydrogenation, achieving a 99.8% acetylene conversion with a space velocity of 3.12&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;mL&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1 in an ethylene&#8208;rich feed gas mixture.








Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) is a promising strategy for removing acetylene from ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams. However, suppressing the undesirable hydrogen evolution is vital for practical applications in acetylene&#8208;insufficient conditions. Herein, Cu single atoms are immobilized on anatase TiO2 nanoplates (Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2) for electrochemical acetylene reduction, achieving an ethylene selectivity of &#8776;97% with a 5&#160;vol% acetylene gas feed (Ar balance). At the optimal Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom loading, Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2 is&#160;able to effectively suppress HER and ethylene over&#8208;hydrogenation even when using dilute acetylene (0.5&#160;vol%) or ethylene&#8208;rich gas feeds, delivering a 99.8% acetylene conversion, providing a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1, which is superior to other EAR catalysts reported to date. Theoretical calculations show that the Cu single atoms and the TiO2 support acted cooperatively to promote charge transfer to adsorbed acetylene molecules, whilst also inhibiting hydrogen generation in alkali environments, thus allowing selective ethylene production with negligible hydrogen evolution at low acetylene concentrations.

         <title>Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ferromagnetic semiconductor is obtained by exploiting the perovskite structure. The obtained (4ampy)CuCl4 exhibits a remarkably saturated magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;reported values for organic/inorganic hybrid intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, and they have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare materials for applications in spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here, a series of molecular FMSs based on the 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4, and (4ampy)CuCl4, is demonstrated, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change, and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements reveal a high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1 for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the 2D layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that 2D hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance intrinsic FMSs.

         <title>A UV&#8208;Resistant Heterogeneous Wettability&#8208;Patterned Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. UPS enables efficient patterning stability under intense UV irradiation of 3000&#160;min.








Abstract
Preparing UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterns is critical for the practical application of surfaces with heterogeneous wettability. However, combining UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials on heterogeneous surfaces is challenging. Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic silica patterns can be created in situ on surfaces covered with superhydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles. The UV resistance time of the UPS with a TiO2&#8208;based surface is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with other surface molecular modification methods that require a mask. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. The UPS enables efficient patterning of functional materials under UV irradiation, controlling the wetting behavior of liquids in open&#8208;air systems. Furthermore, its heterogeneous wettability remains stable even after 50&#160;h of intense UV irradiation (365&#160;nm, 500&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2). These UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterned surfaces will likely be applied in microfluidics, cell culture, energy conversion, and water collection in the future.

         <title>Investigating the Superior Performance of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Compared With Lithium&#8208; and Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hard carbons are fabricated via hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures. The hard carbons, as anodes, exhibit differing ion&#8208;storage trends for Li, Na, and K. The best&#8208;performing material G1500 is tested against a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying excellent energy/power densities and cycling performance.








Abstract
Emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion&#8208;storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali&#8208;ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best&#8208;performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 181.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode). The Na&#8208;ion pouch cell also shows stable ultralong&#8208;term cycling (9000 h or 5142 cycles) and demonstrates the promising potential of such materials as sustainable, scalable anodes for beyond Li&#8208;batteries.

A portable enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 96&#8208;array of bioelectronic sensors assays simultaneously both proteins and nucleic&#8208;acid biomarkers at the single&#8208;molecule level in 0.1&#160;mL of plasma. The prototype comprises a disposable cartridge and a reusable reader. A cohort of 47 patients is screened for the minimally invasive early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The mucinous&#8208;cysts precursors are 100% correctly classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis.








Abstract
A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer precursors with a portable 96&#8208;well bioelectronic sensing&#8208;array for single&#8208;molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma, deployable at point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRASmut DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array proposed here, based on single&#8208;molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;transistor (SiMoT) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single&#8208;molecule limit&#8208;of&#8208;identification (LOI) (1% of false&#8208;positives and false&#8208;negatives). It comprises an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 8 &#215; 12&#8208;array organic&#8208;electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si&#8208;IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB&#8208;connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D&#8208;printed sensing gate cover plate. KRASmut, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts&#8208;fluid from 5 to 6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single&#8208;molecule LOI in 1.5 h. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic&#8208;sensitivity and 100% diagnostic&#8208;specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid&#8208;biopsy&#8208;based early diagnosis of pancreatic&#8208;cancer precursors in plasma.

         <title>Phase Engineering of 2D Spinel&#8208;Type Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic strategy to phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides with thicknesses down to one unit cell is proposed. A unique combination of ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties is demonstrated. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, a Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA Hz&#8722;1/2.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have been of interest due to their unique long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in the low&#8208;dimensional regime and potential applications in spintronics. Currently, most studies are focused on strippable van der Waals magnetic materials with layered structures, which typically suffer from a poor stability and scarce species. Spinel oxides have a good environmental stability and rich magnetic properties. However, the isotropic bonding and close&#8208;packed nonlayered crystal structure make their 2D growth challenging, let alone the phase engineering. Herein, a phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides is reported. Using the van der Waals epitaxy strategy, the thicknesses of the obtained tetragonal and hexagonal manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanosheets can be tuned down to 7.1&#160;nm and one unit cell (0.7&#160;nm), respectively. The magnetic properties of these two phases are evaluated using vibrating&#8208;sample magnetometry and first&#8208;principle calculations. Both structures exhibit a Curie temperature of 48 K. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, the Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA Hz&#8722;1/2. This study broadens the range of 2D magnetic semiconductors and highlights their potential applications in future information devices.

         <title>Stabilization of Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Passivating Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>

CsPbI3 perovskites suffers fast transfer to non&#8208;perovskite phase, especially exposed to humidity. Using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the 3D inorganic perovskite surface, the obtained 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance and higher temperature stability, resulting in improved efficiency and operational stability in solar cells.








Abstract
Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI3 are promising for high&#8208;performance, reproducible, and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non&#8208;perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long&#8208;term operational stability. Here, a surface dimensionality reduction strategy is reported, using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson layer mainly grows at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects and providing favourable interfacial charge transfer. The resulting inorganic perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance when submerged in an aqueous solution (isopropanol:water = 4:1 v/v) and exposed to a 50% humidity air atmosphere. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D/3D inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with a Voc of 1.197&#160;eV. It retains 83% of its initial PCE after 1260&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under 1.2 sun illumination. The work demonstrates an effective way for stabilizing efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Appended Nanosonosensitizers Targeting Tumor Glycolysis for Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Immunometabolic Therapy of Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum&#8208;oxide&#8208;based sonosensitizer is&#160;synthesized and integrated with a glycolysis&#8208;disturbing peptide for simultaneous sonodynamic therapy and tumor metabolic regulation. The reprogramming of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is achieved by inhibiting glucose uptake and lactic acid secretion in the tumor glycolytic process, synergizing with sonodynamic&#8208;elicited immune activation for two&#8208;pronged sonodynamic&#8211;immunometabolic therapy.








Abstract
Despite recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, challenges have yet to be surmounted to achieve two major goals of magnifying antitumor immunity and remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, a nanosystem (ODM&#8208;R) that integrates oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (ODM) nanosonosensitizers and R7 peptides with tumor metabolism regulation effects is designed and fabricated for synergistic sonodynamic&#8211;immunometabolic therapy of spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors. The ODM generates reactive oxygen species upon ultrasound irradiation to implement sonodynamic therapy (SDT), inducing cancer cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. The R7 attached on ODM markedly inhibits the uptake of glucose and excretion of lactic acid in cancer cells by perturbing the glycolysis process. The combination of SDT and tumor glycolysis obstruction by ODM&#8208;R guarantees satisfactory efficacy in synergizing with PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors, achieving concurrent sonodynamic&#8208;triggered immune activation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remodeling. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of nanosonosensitizers for boosting cancer immunotherapy by SDT and tumor metabolic regulation.

This work provides a proof-of-concept of nanosonosensitizers for boosting cancer immunotherapy by SDT and tumor metabolic regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Data Processing with Photon&#8208;Avalanching Nanocrystalline Photonic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly nonlinear, photoexcitation intensity&#8208;dependent luminescence and residual energy storage in photon&#8208;avalanching inorganic Tm3+&#8208;doped fluoride nanoparticles mimic the behavior of biological synapses. These properties enable all&#8208;optical information processing such as multiple inputs and weighted all&#8208;or&#8208;none response, short memory storage, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, coincidence detection from multiple inputs, and complex 2D image data feature extraction.








Abstract
Data processing and storage in electronic devices are typically performed as a sequence of elementary binary operations. Alternative approaches, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing, are rapidly gaining interest where data processing is relatively slow, but can be performed in a more comprehensive way or massively in parallel, like in neuronal circuits. Here, time&#8208;domain all&#8208;optical information processing capabilities of photon&#8208;avalanching (PA) nanoparticles at room temperature are discovered. Demonstrated functionality resembles properties found in neuronal synapses, such as: paired&#8208;pulse facilitation and short&#8208;term internal memory, in situ plasticity, multiple inputs processing, and all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing threshold response. The PA&#8208;memory&#8208;like behavior shows capability of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;algorithm&#8208;free feature extraction and further recognition of 2D patterns with simple 2 input artificial neural network. Additionally, high nonlinearity of luminescence intensity in response to photoexcitation mimics and enhances spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity that is coherent in nature with the way a sound source is localized in animal neuronal circuits. Not only are yet unexplored fundamental properties of photon&#8208;avalanche luminescence kinetics studied, but this approach, combined with recent achievements in photonics, light confinement and guiding, promises all&#8208;optical data processing, control, adaptive responsivity, and storage on photonic chips.

         <title>Self&#8208;Construction of Efficient Interfaces Ensures High&#8208;Performance Direct Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;structured NiFe and NiCu&#8208;decorated interfaces on the anode surface via the attachment of the reduced Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; anode catalytic layer onto the Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; anode can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition and durability of direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells.








Abstract
Direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are highly efficient energy conversion devices since ammonia as a carbon&#8208;neutral hydrogen&#8208;rich carrier shows great potential for storage and long&#8208;distance transportation when compared with hydrogen fuel. However, traditional Ni&#8208;based anodes readily suffer from severe structural destruction and dramatic deactivation after long&#8208;time exposure to ammonia. Here a Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; (SFMC) anode catalytic layer (ACL) painted onto a Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (BZCYYb) anode with enhanced catalytic activity and durability toward the direct utilization of ammonia is reported. A tubular Ni&#8208;BZCYYb anode&#8208;supported cells with the SFMC ACL show excellent peak power densities of 1.77 W cm&#8722;2 in wet H2 (3% H2O) and 1.02 W cm&#8722;2 in NH3 at 650 &#176;C. A relatively stable operation of the cells is obtained at 650 &#176;C for 200 h in ammonia fuel. Such achieved improvements in the activity and durability are attributed to the self&#8208;constructed interfaces with the phases of NiCu or/and NiFe for efficient NH3 decomposition, resulting in a strong NH3 adsorption strength of the SFMC, as confirmed by NH3 thermal conversion and NH3&#8208;temperature programmed desorption. This research offers a valuable strategy of applying an internal catalytic layer for highly active and durable ammonia PCFCs.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Elimination of Defects via Controlled Perovskite Crystallization Dynamics for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>

It is found that a hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive enables the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. The improved perovskite crystallization dynamics finally endow&#160;solar cells with high efficiencies of 25.14% at 300 K and 26.12% at 240 K. 








Abstract
Understanding and controlling crystallization is crucial for high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient solar cells. Herein, the&#160;issue of defects in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) formation is addressed, focusing on the role of intermediates. A comprehensive picture of structural and carrier evolution during crystallization is demonstrated using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Three crystallization stages are identified: precursors to the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 intermediate, then to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, where defects spontaneously emerge. A hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive is found to enable the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, during which the spontaneous generation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 can be effectively circumvented. This additive extends the initial growth kinetics and facilitates solvent&#8211;FA+ ion exchange, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. Therefore, the improved crystallization dynamics lead to larger grain sizes and fewer defects within thin films. Ultimately, the improved perovskite crystallization dynamics enable&#160;high&#8208;performance solar cells,&#160;achieving impressive efficiencies of 25.14%&#160;at 300&#160;K and 26.12% at 240&#160;K. This breakthrough might open up a new era of application for the emerging perovskite photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Intermittent Defect Fluctuations in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermittent, equilibrium dynamics of brownmillerite/perovskite domains in an epitaxial SrCoOx on LSAT substrate are revealed using in situ Bragg X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy. The dynamics appear to be thermally activated and can be tuned via epitaxial strain, consistent with results from density functional theory and phase field simulations.








Abstract
The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and their influence on the functionality of a material. Here, the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy is reported. Local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoOx with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies are observed. Ab&#8208;initio&#8208;informed phase&#8208;field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion/vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent X&#8208;rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. The study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.

&lt;p&gt;The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and their influence on the functionality of a material. Here, the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy is reported. Local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies are observed. Ab-initio-informed phase-field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion/vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent X-rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. The study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Anode&#8208;Free Batteries Enabled by Li Compensation Coupled Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>

Utilization of Li2S as a Li supplement and interfacial promoter facilitates efficient Li compensation coupled interface strengthening against irreversible Li loss, enabling a durable quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free battery with long life, high energy, and remarkable safety.








Abstract
Initially, anode&#8208;free Li metal batteries present a promising power source that merges the high production feasibility of Li&#8208;ion batteries with the superb energy capabilities of Li&#8208;metal batteries. However, their application confronts formidable challenges of extremely short lifespan due to the inadequacy of zero&#8208;Li&#8208;excess cell configuration against irreversible Li loss. A Li compensation coupled interface engineering strategy is reported for realizing long&#8208;life quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries. The Li2S is utilized as a sacrificial Li supplement to effectively counterbalance irreversible Li loss without damage to cell chemistry. Meanwhile, it demonstrates remarkable efficacy in establishing a robust yet slender inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid solid&#8208;state interphase for inhibiting cell degradation by dead and dendritic Li. This strategy enables quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free batteries with a long lifespan of 500 cycles. The Ah&#8208;scale quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, featuring a high&#8208;loading LiFePO4 cathode and lean gel polymer electrolyte, exhibit a high specific energy of 300&#160;Wh&#160;kgcell&#8722;1. This achievement translates into an improvement of 46% in gravimetric energy and 94% in volumetric energy compared to LiFePO4||graphite batteries while outperforming LiFePO4||Li&#8208;metal batteries by 22&#8211;47% in volumetric energy. Such quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state anode&#8208;free cells also demonstrate good safety, showcasing remarkable resistance against nail penetration in ambient air without failure, smoke, or fire accidents.

         <title>Embedding Living Cells with a Mechanically Reinforced and Functionally Programmable Hydrogel Fiber Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sheath&#8211;core living hydrogel fiber platform is introduced, wherein synthetic biology and microfluidic spinning are integrated, offering enhanced programmability, mechanical robustness, and functional diversity. The platform's innovative design allows for tailored porous architectures and improved mechanical performance, alongside applications like coloration of fibers and water pollutant detection through modified bacterial gene circuits.








Abstract
Living materials represent a new frontier in functional material design, integrating synthetic biology tools to endow materials with programmable, dynamic, and life&#8208;like characteristics. However, a major challenge in creating living materials is balancing the tradeoff between structural stability, mechanical performance, and functional programmability. To address this challenge, a sheath&#8211;core living hydrogel fiber platform that synergistically integrates living bacteria with hydrogel fibers to achieve both functional diversity and structural and mechanical robustness is proposed. In the design, microfluidic spinning is used to produce hydrogel fiber, which offers advantages in both structural and functional designability due to their hierarchical porous architectures that can be tailored and their mechanical performance that can be enhanced through a variety of post&#8208;processing approaches. By introducing living bacteria, the platform is endowed with programmable functionality and life&#8208;like capabilities. This work reconstructs the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enable the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. Altogether, this study establishes a structure&#8211;property&#8211;function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform, providing a new tool for accelerating the practical applications of the emerging living material systems.

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering of Ni2P Enables Efficient Catalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet robust strategy is developed for strain engineering of Ni2P via double&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. Both experimental and theoretic results reveal that the compressive strain can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier of HzOR and HER, thereby significantly enhance the performance of hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis provides new opportunities to enable energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production while solving the issue of hydrazine pollution. Here, the synthesis of compressively strained Ni2P as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for boosting both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. Different from a multistep synthetic method that induces lattice strain by creating core&#8211;shell structures, a facile strategy is developed to tune the strain of&#160;Ni2P via dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. The obtained Ni2P with a compressive strain of &#8722;3.62% exhibits significantly enhanced activity for both the HzOR and HER than counterparts with tensile strain and without strain. Consequently, the optimized Ni2P delivers current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at small cell voltages of 0.16 and 0.39&#160;V for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain promotes water dissociation and concurrently tunes the adsorption strength of hydrogen intermediates, thereby facilitating the HER process on Ni2P. As for the HzOR, the compressive strain reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step for the dehydrogenation of *N2H4 to *N2H3. Clearly, this work paves a facile pathway to the synthesis of lattice&#8208;strained electrocatalysts via the dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Structurally&#8208;Distorted RuIr&#8208;Based Nanoframes for Long&#8208;Duration Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally&#8208;distorted CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with twisted Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8211;M (M = Ru, Ir) are successfully constructed via cation exchange and sequential thermal treatment, which can be used as ultra&#8208;active and ultra&#8208;stable acidic OER catalyst due to the strong synergy between Ru and Ir.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), yet the electrocatalysts still suffer from the disadvantages of low activity and poor stability in acidic conditions. Here, a new class of CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with distorted structure for acidic OER is successfully fabricated. Impressively, CdRu2IrOx displays an ultralow overpotential of 189&#160;mV and an ultralong stability of 1500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 toward OER in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Moreover, a PEMWE using the distorted CdRu2IrOx can be steadily operated at 0.1 A cm&#8315;2 for 90&#160;h. Microstructural analyses and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the synergy between Ru and Ir in CdRu2IrOx induces the distortion of Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8722;M (M = Ru, Ir) bonds. In situ XAS indicates that the applied potential leads to the deformation octahedral structure of RuOx/IrOx and the formation of stable Ru5+ species for OER. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the distorted structures can reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;limiting step during OER. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing structural distortion to achieve significant enhancement on the activity and stability of OER catalysts.

In situ XAS indicates that the applied potential leads to the deformation octahedral structure of RuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/IrO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of stable Ru&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; species for OER. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the distorted structures can reduce the energy barrier of rate-limiting step during OER. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing structural distortion to achieve significant enhancement on the activity and stability of OER catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Touch Device with Two Terminals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the integration of resistor and capacitor elements with material composition gradients, 3D touch detection is enabled with only two terminal electrodes. Unlike conventional crossbar arrays, this approach provides full 3D input capability without being limited by wiring complexity. The measurement system represents a groundbreaking approach to simplifying the input device architecture to achieve large&#8208;area high resolution.








Abstract
A crossbar array is an essential element that determines the operating position and simplifies the structure of devices. However, in the crossbar array, wiring numerous electrodes to address many positions poses significant challenges. In this study, a method is proposed that utilizes only two electrodes to determine multiple positions. The method significantly simplifies the wiring and device fabrication process. Instead of defining the node location of the crossbar, it is experimentally demonstrated that the x&#8211;y&#8211;z coordinates can be determined from i) the resistance change as a function of distance, ii) the resistance variation influenced by the electrode composition, and iii) capacitance fluctuation resulting from changes in the dielectric thickness. By employing two&#8208;terminal transparent electrodes, a fully functional 3D touch device is successfully fabricated, introducing a groundbreaking approach to simplify input device architectures.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Grown Cu Dendrites Plasmonically Enhance Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Facet&#8208;Engineered Cu2O</title>

Facet&#8208;engineered&#160;Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet&#8208;chemical methods for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;Operando&#160;Raman spectroscopy and&#160;ex situ&#160;characterization techniques show that Cu2O is reduced during HER.&#160;Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency measurements combined with ab&#160;initio&#160;nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the hot&#8208;electron injection from Cu dendrites to Cu2O facilitates the plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity.








Abstract
Herein, facet&#8208;engineered Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet chemical methods for electrocatalytic HER, and it is found that the octahedral Cu2O nanostructures with exposed crystal planes of (111) (O&#8208;Cu2O) has the best hydrogen evolution performance. Operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques showed that Cu2O is reduced during HER, in which Cu dendrites are grown on the surface of the Cu2O nanostructures, resulting in the better HER performance of O&#8208;Cu2O after HER (O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A) compared with that of the as&#8208;prepared O&#8208;Cu2O. Under illumination, the onset potential of O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A is ca. 52 mV positive than that of O&#8208;Cu2O, which is induced by the plasmon&#8208;activated electrochemical system consisting of Cu2O and the in&#8208;situ generated Cu dendrites. Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) measurements and the simulated UV&#8211;Vis spectrum demonstrate the hot electron injection (HEI) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O. Ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations revealed the transfer of photogenerated electrons (27 fs) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O nanostructures is faster than electron relaxation (170 fs), enhancing its surface plasmons activity, and the HEI of Cu dendrites increases the charge density of Cu2O. These make the energy level of the catalyst be closer to that of H+/H2, evidenced by the plasmon&#8208;enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Highly Stable and Efficient Formamidinium&#8208;Based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells via Lattice Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate selection of spacer cations and polarity&#8208;matched molecular additives is presented to manipulate the 2D perovskite lattice, improving related texture and stability. The optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.03% (certified efficiency of 19.30%). Furthermore, the devices exhibit less than 1% efficiency degradation after operation at maximum power point for 1000 h.








Abstract
Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates in solar cells. However, the insertion of 2D spacer cations into the perovskite lattice concomitantly introduces microstrain and unfavorable orientations that hinder efficiency and stability. In this study, by finely tuning the FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite lattice through spacer cation engineering, a stable lattice structure with balanced distortion, microstrain relaxation, and reduced carrier&#8211;lattice interactions is achieved. These advancements effectively stabilize the inherently soft lattice against light and thermal&#8208;aging stress. To reduce the photocurrent loss induced by undesired crystal texture, a polarity&#8208;matched molecular&#8208;type selenourea (SENA) additive is further employed to modulate the crystallization kinetics. The introduction of the SENA significantly inhibits the disordered crystallization induced by spacer cations and drives the templated growth of the quantum well structure with a vertical orientation. This controlled crystallization process effectively reduces crystal defects and enhances charge separation. Ultimately, the optimized FA&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% (certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.30%), setting a new record for low&#8208;n 2D perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the devices exhibit less than 1% efficiency degradation after operating at maximum power point for 1000 h and maintain excellent stability after thermal aging and cycles of cold&#8211;warm shock, respectively.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2MnN8 Triatomic Sites Anchored in N&#8208;Doped Carbon Enabling Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

Benefiting from the redistribution of d electrons for the spontaneous adsorption of *OH and the optimized binding energy of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) intermediates, an as&#8208;constructed novel trinuclear structure with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single Mn atom adjacent to two Co atoms anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon (Co2MnN8/C) exhibits an exceptional ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal&#8211;nitrogen/carbon (M&#8211;N/C) catalysts have emerged as the most promising substitutes to the precious platinum counterparts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the reported M&#8211;N/C catalysts are usually in the form of common M&#8211;N4 moieties with only a single metal active site, and they suffer from insufficient activity. Herein, an unusual trinuclear active structure is elaborately developed with a nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single Mn atom adjacent to two Co atoms (Co2MnN8) anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon as a highly efficient ORR catalyst via adsorption&#8211;pyrolysis of a bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor. Atomic structural investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Co2MnN8 would experience a spontaneous OH binding to form Co2MnN8&#8208;2OH as the real active site, leading to a single electron&#8208;filled state in the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital and an optimized binding energy of intermediates. Accordingly, the as&#8208;developed Co2MnN8/C exhibits an unprecedented ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability, not only surpassing the Pt/C catalyst but also representing a new record for the Co&#8208;based catalyst.

Atomic structural investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnN&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; would experience a spontaneous OH binding to form Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnN&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;-2OH as the real active site, leading to a single electron-filled state in the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital and an optimized binding energy of intermediates. Accordingly, the as-developed Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MnN&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;/C exhibits an unprecedented ORR activity with a high half-wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability, not only surpassing the Pt/C catalyst but also representing a new record for the Co-based catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conversion of Surface Residual Alkali to Solid Electrolyte to Enable Na&#8208;Ion Full Cells with Robust Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaMgPO4 is used to modify the interface of the O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT) to reduce surface residual alkali and improve cycle performance. The excellent interface facilitates the transport of Na+ and reduces the dissolution of transition metals (TMs). A high discharge capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a superior stability under the 4.3 V cutoff voltage are obtained successfully in assembled full cells.








Abstract
The deposition of volatilized Na+ on the surface of the cathode during sintering results in the formation of surface residual alkali (NaOH/Na2CO3NaHCO3) in layered cathode materials, leading to serious interfacial reactions and performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT). In this study, a strategy is proposed to transform waste into treasure by converting residual alkali into a solid electrolyte. Mg(CH3COO)2 and H3PO4 are reacted with surface residual alkali to generate the solid electrolyte NaMgPO4 on the surface of NCMT, which can be labeled as NaMgPO4@NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2&#8208;X (NMP@NCMT&#8208;X, where X indicates the different amounts of Mg2+ and PO43&#8722;). NaMgPO4 acts as a special ionic conductivity channel on the surface to improve the kinetics of the electrode reactions, remarkably improving the rate capability of the modified cathode at a high current density in the half&#8208;cell. Additionally, NMP@NCMT&#8208;2 enables a reversible phase transition from the P3 to OP2 phase in the charge&#8211;discharge process above 4.2&#160;V and achieves a high specific capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding capacity retention in the full cell. The strategy can effectively and reliably stabilize the interface and improve the performance of layered cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs).

         <title>Engineering Sub&#8208;Nanometer Hafnia&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics to Break the Scaling Relation for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase are synthesized. The ferroelectric polarization of flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the "scaling relationship" during piezocatalysis.








Abstract
Reversible control of ferroelectric polarization is essential to overcome the heterocatalytic kinetic limitation. This can be achieved by creating a surface with switchable electron density; however, owing to the rigidity of traditional ferroelectric oxides, achieving polarization reversal in piezocatalytic processes remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with a polymer&#8208;like flexibility are synthesized. Oxygen K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and negative spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy reveal an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase of the HZO sub&#8208;nanometer wires (SNWs). The ferroelectric polarization of the flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the &#8220;scaling relationship&#8221; during piezocatalysis. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized ultrathin HZO nanowires display superb water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rate of 25687&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under 40&#160;kHz ultrasonic vibration, which is 235&#160;and 41&#160;times higher than those of non&#8208;ferroelectric hafnium oxides and rigid BaTiO3 nanoparticles, respectively. More strikingly, the hydrogen production rates can reach 5.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 by addition of stirring exclusively.

         <title>Bifacial and Semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells for Single&#8208;Junction and Tandem Photovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exhibit exceptional bifaciality of 0.86 and satisfactory long&#8208;wavelength transmittance exceeding 60%, highly suitable for initial real&#8208;world applications that leverage their ability to effectively absorb tilted incident illumination and enhance performance by exploiting albedo. Furthermore, their compatibility with silicon solar cells enables their integration in tandem applications, unlocking further potential for promoted efficiency.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film solar cells are expected to play a significant role in the space industry, building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV), indoor applications, and tandem solar cells, where bifaciality and semitransparency are highly desired. Sb2(S,Se)3 has emerged as a promising new photovoltaic (PV) material for its high absorption coefficient, tunable bandgap, and nontoxic and earth&#8208;abundant constituents. However, high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells exclusively employ monofacial architectures, leaving a considerable gap toward large&#8208;scale application in aforementioned fields. Here, a bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell and its extended application in tandem solar cells are reported. The transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) and the ultrathin inner n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure provide high long&#8208;wavelength transmittance. Despite the MnS/ITO Schottky junction, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.41% and 6.36% are achieved with front and rear illumination, respectively, contributing to a great bifaciality of 0.86. Consequently, the reported device gains great enhancement in PV performance by exploiting albedo of surroundings and shows exceptional capability in absorbing tilt incident light. Moreover, an&#160;Sb2(S,Se)3/Si tandem solar cell with a PCE of 11.66% is achieved in preliminary trials. These exciting findings imply that bifacial and semitransparent Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells possess tremendous potential in practical applications based on their unique characteristics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) with a skeleton&#8208;matrix structure is elaborated through dual dynamic interfacial healing driven by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. The IAE remedied the decline in mechanical performance caused by subtractive manufacturing while retaining its auxetic property in a large deformation, which paves a way for automatic scaled&#8208;up synthesis of modular heterogeneous metamaterials.








Abstract
Auxetic materials are appealing due to their unique characteristics of transverse expansion while being axially stretched. Nevertheless, current auxetic materials are often produced by the introduction of diverse geometric structures through cutting or other pore&#8208;making processes, which heavily weaken their mechanical performance. Inspired by the skeleton&#8208;matrix structures in natural organisms, this study reports an integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) composed of high&#8208;modulus cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a skeleton and low&#8208;modulus non&#8208;cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a complementary&#8208;shape matrix. Benefiting from disulfide bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;promoted dual dynamic interfacial healing, the resulting IAE is flat, void&#8208;free, and has no sharp soft&#8208;to&#8208;hard interface. Its fracture strength and elongation at the break are increased to 400% and 150%, respectively, of the values of corrugated re&#8208;entrant skeleton alone, while the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) reserves within a strain range of 0%&#8211;104%. In addition, the advantageous mechanical and auxetic properties of this elastomer are further confirmed by finite element analysis. The concept of combining two dissimilar polymers into an integrated hybrid material solves the problem of the deterioration in mechanical performance of auxetic materials after subtractive manufacturing, while preserves the NPR effect in a large deformation, which provides a promising approach to robust auxetic materials for engineering applications.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Multiple&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Intrinsically Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edge&#8208;topology molecular&#8208;engineering strategy is proposed to construct circularly polarized multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence materials with intrinsically helical chirality. The enantiomers (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit pure&#8208;green emission, with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage coordinates of (0.29, 0.68), maximum external quantum efficiency exceeding 30%, and electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of approximately 4.40 &#215; 10&#8722;4.








Abstract
Advanced circularly polarized multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials synergize the advantages of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), narrowband emission, and the TADF characteristic, which can be fabricated into highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high color purity, directly facing the urgent market strategic demand of ultrahigh&#8208;definition and 3D displays. In this work, based on an edge&#8208;topology molecular&#8208;engineering (ETME) strategy, a pair of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, is developed, which merges the intrinsically helical chirality into the MR framework. The optimized CP&#8208;OLEDs with (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py emitters and the newly developed ambipolar transport host PhCbBCz exhibit pure green emission with sharp peaks of 532&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 37&#160;nm, and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.29, 0.68). Importantly, they achieve remarkable maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.6% and 29.2%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of &#8722;4.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 and +4.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (P)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and (M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, respectively.

         <title>Anions Regulation Engineering Enables a Highly Reversible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Nickel&#8208;Metal Anode with Ultrahigh Capacities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel as a transition metal has excellent electrochemical properties, which is expected to be one of the attractive metal anodes in aqueous batteries. In this work, nickel&#8208;metal batteries by the design of an anion&#8208;regulation electrolyte achieve reversible nickel plating/stripping with an ultrahigh capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of 15&#160;000&#160;times.








Abstract
The development of safe and high&#8208;energy metal anodes represents a crucial research direction. Here, the achievement of highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free transition metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities by regulating aqueous electrolytes is reported. Using nickel (Ni) as a model, theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the beneficial role of chloride ions in inhibiting and disrupting the nickel hydroxide passivation layer on the Ni electrode is provided. As a result, Ni anodes with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (volumetric capacity of &#8776;6000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3), and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on a carbon substrate, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes by approximately two orders of magnitude, are realized. Furthermore, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a series of full cells based on the Ni anode is&#160;developed. The designed Ni&#8211;MnO2 full battery exhibits a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, while the Ni&#8211;PbO2 full battery achieves a high areal capacity of 200&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings of this study are important for enlightening a new arena toward the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free Ni&#8208;metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities and long cycle life for various energy&#8208;storage devices.

Instant Lubricants
In article number 2302076, Philipp G. Gr&#252;tzmacher, Manel Rodr&#237;guez Ripoll, Carsten Gachot, Ali Erdemir, Maria Clelia Righi, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that when Se nanoparticles are sprinkled onto Mo or W metallic surfaces, friction comes down dramatically through the formation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) during sliding. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations uncover the atomistic mechanisms responsible for the formation of these TMDs. Image credit: Hendrik Ehrich contributed substantially to the image design.

Bio&#8208;Polymorphs
In article number 2302756, Guglielmo Lanzani, Francesca Di Maria, and co&#8208;workers report the intracellular formation of crystalline, fluorescent, and conductive fibers. These cell&#8208;made &#8220;bio&#8221; polymorphic materials have the unique ability to &#8220;connect&#8221; cells by penetrating the plasma membrane of neighboring cells without killing them and to conform/adapt to the cellular movement, indicating high fiber flexibility and potentially allowing for dynamic interactions and information exchange.

Defect Dynamics
In article 2305383, Qingteng Zhang, Gang Wan, Vitalii Starchenko, Guoxiang Hu, Ho Nyung Lee, P. Ganesh, Dillon Fong, and co&#8208;workers study the domain boundary fluctuation between a metallic perovskite (Pv) phase and the insulating brownmillerite (Bm) phase domains in epitaxial SrCoOx film (2.5 &lt; x &lt; 3). Competition between the Pv and Bm phases leads to intermittent domain fluctuation even at thermal equilibrium, which provides novel perspectives for devices based on probabilistic (p)&#8208;bits beyond the Boolean logic.

Achromatic Copper Films
Diverse colors can be attained solely through manipulation of the surface of copper. Uniformly oxidizing the copper surface and controlling the thickness of the resulting oxide layer has proven that comprehensive natural coloration can be achieved. In article number 2210564, Young&#8208;Min Kim, Se&#8208;Young Jeong, and co&#8208;workers fabricate a rough copper surface, characterized by dendrites, to realize an extensive spectrum of achromatic colors. This unique rough copper surface, resembling nanocavities, effectively captures and traps light.

         <title>Aqueous Organic Batteries Using the Proton as a Charge Carrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses unique properties such as fast diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, endowing aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span, and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, as well as high safety. A comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is presented, together with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes








Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of low cost, nonflammability, and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications. Among various metal&#8208;ion/non&#8208;metallic charge carriers, the proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span, and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox&#8208;active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton&#8208;storage sites, and abundant resources, are considered attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, the charge&#8208;storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs are still in their infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H+&#8208;storage mechanisms are significant for the application of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progress on organic materials, such as small molecules and polymers for APBs, is reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially regarding their low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.

         <title>Illuminating the Brain: Advances and Perspectives in Optoelectronics for Neural Activity Monitoring and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances in implantable optoelectronics for neural activity monitoring and modulation is provided. Combining optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural network interface has gained momentum in recent years, and controlling the spatial coverage of illumination, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation.








Abstract
Optogenetic modulation of brain neural activity that combines optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural system has recently gained robust momentum. Controlling illumination spatial coverage, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation. To this end, biocompatible electrodes with enhanced optoelectrical performance, device integration for multiplexed addressing, wireless transmission, and multimodal operation in soft systems have been developed. This review provides an outlook for uniformly illuminating large brain areas while spatiotemporally imaging the neural responses upon optoelectrical stimulation with little artifacts. Representative concepts and important breakthroughs, such as head&#8208;mounted illumination, multiple implanted optical fibers, and micro&#8208;light&#8208;delivery devices, are discussed. Examples of techniques that incorporate electrophysiological monitoring and optoelectrical stimulation are presented. Challenges and perspectives are posed for further research efforts toward high&#8208;density optoelectrical neural interface modulation, with the potential for nonpharmacological neurological disease treatments and wireless optoelectrical stimulation.

         <title>Water&#8208;Resistant Conductive Gels toward Underwater Wearable Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 42, October 19, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underwater wearable sensing is of great significance for improving the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. This review presents the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors, which provides guidance for promoting the rapid development of gel&#8208;based underwater wearable sensors.








Abstract
Conductive gels are developing vigorously as superior wearable sensing materials due to their intrinsic conductivity, softness, stretchability, and biocompatibility, showing a great potential in many aspects of lives. However, compared to their wide application on land, it is significant yet rather challenging for traditional conductive gels to realize sensing application under water. The swelling of gels and the loss of conductive components in the aqueous environment, resulted from the diffusion across the interface, lead to structural instability and sensing performance decline. Fortunately, great efforts are devoted to improving the water resistance of conductive gels and employing them in the field of underwater wearable sensing in recent years, and some exciting achievements are obtained, which are of great significance for promoting the safety and efficiency of underwater activities. However, there is no review to thoroughly summarize the underwater sensing application of conductive gels. This review presents a brief overview of the representative design strategies for developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels and their diversified applications in the underwater sensing field as wearable sensors. Finally, the ongoing challenges for further developing water&#8208;resistant conductive gels for underwater wearable sensing are also discussed along with recommendations for the future.

         <dc:description>
Two distinct requirements of various nanomaterials, including from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures, are summarized, including where strain must be avoided, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and where strain is required, such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes.








Abstract
2D materials with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces and atomically thin layers have been shown to be capable of being incorporated into flexible electronic devices. The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned or controlled in other ways by using the intriguing strain engineering method. The latest and encouraging techniques in regard to creating flexible 2D nanoelectronics are condensed in this review. These techniques have the potential to be used in a wider range of applications in the near and long term. It is possible to use ultrathin 2D materials (graphene, BP, WTe2, VSe2 etc.) and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) in order to enable the electrical behavior of the devices to be studied. A category of materials is produced on smaller scales by exfoliating bulk materials, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth are employed on larger scales. This overview highlights two distinct requirements, which include from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures of various nanomaterials. They include where strain must be avoided and where it is required, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes, respectively. Finally, points&#8208;of&#8208;view about the current difficulties and possibilities in regard to using 2D materials in flexible electronics are provided.

         <title>Synergizing a Large Ordinary Nernst Effect and Axis&#8208;Dependent Conduction Polarity in Flat Band KMgBi Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exploration of quantum materials in which an applied thermo/electrical/magnetic field along one crystallographic direction produces an anisotropic response has led to unique functionalities. Along these lines, KMgBi is a layered, narrow gap semiconductor near a critical state between multiple Dirac phases due to the presence of a flat band near the Fermi level. The valence band is highly anisotropic with minimal cross&#8208;plane dispersion, which, in combination with an isotropic conduction band, enables axis&#8208;dependent conduction polarity. Thermopower and Hall measurements indicate dominant p&#8208;type conduction along the cross&#8208;plane direction, and n&#8208;type conduction along the in&#8208;plane direction, leading to a significant zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric response when the heat flux is at an angle to the principal crystallographic directions. Additionally, a large Ordinary Nernst effect (ONE) is observed with an applied field.&#160; It arises from the ambipolar term in the Nernst effect, whereby the Lorentz force on electrons and holes makes them drift in opposite directions so that the resulting Nernst voltage becomes a function of the difference between their partial thermopowers, greatly enhancing the ONE. We prove that axis&#8208;dependent polarity&#160;can synergistically enhance the ONE, in addition to leading to a zero&#8208;field transverse thermoelectric performance.

Abstract
Immune cells are pivotal in cancer immunotherapy, yet their therapeutic effectiveness is often hampered by limited tumor infiltration and inhibitory tumor microenvironments. We here introduce an alkaline phosphatase (ALP)&#8208;responsive and transformable supramolecular bis&#8208;specific cell engager (Supra&#8208;BiCE) to harness NK/T cells for effective cancer immunotherapy. The Supra&#8208;BiCE, consisting of both SA&#8208;P (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking PD&#8208;L1) and SA&#8208;T (a phosphorylated peptide targeting and blocking TIGIT) is constructed by a simple co&#8208;assembling strategy. Upon intravenous administration, Supra&#8208;BiCE self&#8208;assembles into nanoribbons and interacts with NK/T cells via TIGIT. Notably, these nanoribbons undergo transformation into long nanofibrils within ALP&#8208;overexpressing tumor regions, resulting in enhanced binding affinities of Supra&#8208;BiCE to both PD&#8208;L1 and TIGIT. Consequently, this leads to the accumulation and retention of NK cells and CD8+ T cells within tumor regions. Furthermore, the combinatorial blockade of checkpoints by Supra&#8208;BiCE activates infiltrating NK/T cells, as evidenced by upregulated expression of perforin, granzyme B, TNF&#8208;a, and IL&#8208;2. Moreover, the adjustable peptide ratio in Supra&#8208;BiCE enables customization for optimal therapeutic effects against distinct tumor types. Particularly, Supra&#8208;BiCE (T:P = 1:3) achieved 98.27% tumor suppression rate against CT26 cell tumor model. Overall, our study offers a promising tool for engaging NK and T cells for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biohybrid Microstructures Enable Transplantation and Vascularization of Microtissues in the Anterior Chamber of the Eye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transplanting 3D&#8208;printed biohybrid microstructures to the anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) with the aim of vascular engraftment is investigated. The ACE is an ideal platform for studying interactions between host tissues and transplant, as well as for biomedical device trans/&#8208;implantation. The results identify pupillary dynamics as an effective factor involved in graft integrity to the host. Microstructures that provide a more static configuration lead to successful vascularization even in a no&#8208;contact mode (to the vessel source) and a fluidic microenvironment.








Abstract
Hybridizing biological cells with man&#8208;made sensors enable the detection of a wide range of weak physiological responses with high specificity. The anterior chamber of the eye (ACE) is an ideal transplantation site due to its ocular immune privilege and optical transparency, which enable superior noninvasive longitudinal analyses of cells and microtissues. Engraftment of biohybrid microstructures in the ACE may, however, be affected by the pupillary response and dynamics. Here, sutureless transplantation of biohybrid microstructures, 3D printed in IP&#8208;Visio photoresin, containing a precisely localized pancreatic islet to the ACE of mice is presented. The biohybrid microstructures allow mechanical fixation in the ACE, independent of iris dynamics. After transplantation, islets in the microstructures successfully sustain their functionality for over 20 weeks and become vascularized despite physical separation from the vessel source (iris) and immersion in a low&#8208;viscous liquid (aqueous humor) with continuous circulation and clearance. This approach opens new perspectives in biohybrid microtissue transplantation in the ACE, advancing monitoring of microtissue&#8211;host interactions, disease modeling, treatment outcomes, and vascularization in engineered tissues.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors analyze the reaction mechanism of Bi2Te3&#8208;based cathode for zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. The authors also demonstrate the great application prospect of aqueous ZIBs in flexible electronics via jet printing technology.








Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hamper their deployment. Herein, a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy) is proposed. Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, here the reaction mechanism is analyzed using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and it is demonstrated that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIB cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

         <title>Sb&#8208;Doped Cs3TbCl6 Nanocrystals for Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Band Green Emission and X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional Sb&#8208;doped lanthanide halide nanocrystals are reported. The origin of the narrower enhanced green PL emission is mainly attributed to highly localized exciton distribution, Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transition process, and effective thermally activated exciton energy transfer. It indicates that the Sb&#8208;doped nanocrystals serve as a promising nanoscintillator, which has versatile application prospects for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Metal halide nanocrystals (NCs) with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) are desirable for lighting, display, and X&#8208;ray detection. Herein, the novel lanthanide&#8208;based halide NCs are committed to designing and optimizing the optical and scintillating properties, so as to unravel the PL origin, exciton dynamics, and optoelectronic applications. Sb&#8208;doped zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) Cs3TbCl6 NCs exhibit a green emission with a narrow full width of half maximum of 8.6&#160;nm, and the best PLQY of 48.1% is about three times higher than that of undoped NCs. Experiments and theoretical calculations indicate that 0D crystalline and electronic structures make the exciton highly localized on [TbCl6]3&#8722; octahedron, which boosts the Cl&#8722;&#8208;Tb3+ charge transfer process, thus resulting in bright Tb3+ emission. More importantly, the introduction of Sb3+ not only facilitates the photon absorption transition, but also builds an effective thermally boosting energy transfer channel assisted by [SbCl6]3&#8722;&#8208;induced self&#8208;trapped state, which is responsible for the PL enhancement. The high luminescence efficiency and negligible self&#8208;absorption of the Cs3TbCl6: Sb nanoscintillator enable a more sensitive X&#8208;ray detection response compared with undoped sample. The study opens a new perspective to deeply understand the excited state dynamics of metal halide NCs, which helps to design high&#8208;performance luminescent lanthanide&#8208;based nanomaterials.

         <title>Promoting the Recruitment, Engagement, and Reinvigoration of Effector T Cells via an Injectable Hydrogel with a Supramolecular Binding Capability for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;decorated alginate hydrogel system with T cell recruitment, engagement, and reinvigoration capabilities is developed to enhance T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. 1) The adamantane&#8208;decorated anti&#8208;PD1 antibodies (Ad&#8208;aPD1) hitchhike on T cells. 2) Recruitment of T cells. 3) Supramolecular immobilization of antibodies. 4) Improved engagement between T cells and tumor cells. 5) Reinvigorated T cells in tumor tissue.









Abstract
T cells play a basic and key role in immunotherapy against solid tumors, and efficiently recruiting them into neoplastic foci and sustaining long&#8208;term effector function are consistent goals that remain a critical challenge. Here, an injectable alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with abundant &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (ALG&#8208;&#946;CD) sites is developed and intratumorally injected to recruit CCR9+CD8+ T cells (a subset of T cells with robust antitumor activity) via the trapped chemokine CCL25. In the meantime, an intravenously injected adamantane&#8208;decorated anti&#8208;PD1 antibody (Ad&#8208;aPD1) would hitchhike on recruited CCR9+CD8+ T cells to achieve the improved intratumoral accumulation of Ad&#8208;aPD1. Moreover, the Ad&#8208;PD1 and Ad&#8208;PDL1 antibodies are immobilized in the ALG&#8208;&#946;CD hydrogel through supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions of Ad and &#946;CD, which facilitate engagement between CD8+ T cells and tumor cells and reinvigorate CD8+ T cells to avoid exhaustion. Based on this treatment strategy, T cell&#8208;mediated anticancer activity is promoted at multiple levels, eventually achieving superior antitumor efficacy in both orthotopic and postsurgical B16&#8208;F10 tumor models.

&lt;p&gt;A &#946;-cyclodextrin-decorated alginate hydrogel system with T cell recruitment, engagement, and reinvigoration capabilities is developed to enhance T cell-mediated immunotherapy. 1) The adamantane-decorated anti-PD1 antibodies (Ad-aPD1) hitchhike on T cells. 2) Recruitment of T cells. 3) Supramolecular immobilization of antibodies. 4) Improved engagement between T cells and tumor cells. 5) Reinvigorated T cells in tumor tissue.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T cells play a basic and key role in immunotherapy against solid tumors, and efficiently recruiting them into neoplastic foci and sustaining long-term effector function are consistent goals that remain a critical challenge. Here, an injectable alginate-based hydrogel with abundant &#946;-cyclodextrin (ALG-&#946;CD) sites is developed and intratumorally injected to recruit CCR9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells (a subset of T cells with robust antitumor activity) via the trapped chemokine CCL25. In the meantime, an intravenously injected adamantane-decorated anti-PD1 antibody (Ad-aPD1) would hitchhike on recruited CCR9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to achieve the improved intratumoral accumulation of Ad-aPD1. Moreover, the Ad-PD1 and Ad-PDL1 antibodies are immobilized in the ALG-&#946;CD hydrogel through supramolecular host&#8211;guest interactions of Ad and &#946;CD, which facilitate engagement between CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells and tumor cells and reinvigorate CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells to avoid exhaustion. Based on this treatment strategy, T cell-mediated anticancer activity is promoted at multiple levels, eventually achieving superior antitumor efficacy in both orthotopic and postsurgical B16-F10 tumor models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Li2MnO3: A Catalyst for a Liquid Cl2 Electrode in Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Below &#8722;35&#160;&#176;C, the anionic oxygen redox in Li2MnO3 is &#8220;frozen,&#8221; thus not contributing to the observed capacity. However, at low temperatures, Li2MnO3 catalyzes a reversible redox reaction of Cl2(l)/Cl&#8722; on its surface in aqueous 7 m&#160;LiCl.








Abstract
Li2MnO3 has been contemplated as a high&#8208;capacity cathode candidate for Li&#8208;ion batteries; however, it evolves oxygen during battery charging under ambient conditions, which hinders a reversible reaction. However, it is unclear if this irreversible process still holds under subambient conditions. Here, the low&#8208;temperature electrochemical properties of Li2MnO3 in an aqueous LiCl electrolyte are evaluated and a reversible discharge capacity of 302 mAh g&#8722;1 at a potential of 1.0&#160;V versus Ag/AgCl at &#8722;78 &#176;C with good rate capability and stable cycling performance, in sharp contrast to the findings in a typical Li2MnO3 cell cycled at room temperature, is observed. However, the results reveal that the capacity does not originate from the reversible oxygen oxidation in Li2MnO3 but the reversible Cl2(l)/Cl&#8722;(aq.) redox from the electrolyte. The results demonstrate the good catalytic properties of Li2MnO3 to promote the Cl2/Cl&#8722; redox at low temperatures.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanoregulator to Mitigate Dynamic Immune Evasion of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC)&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator with first&#8208;stage spherical micelle to nanofiber, and second&#8208;stage nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles morphology transformation performance, is developed for tailoring dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The nanoregulator is demonstrated to intervene in cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast&#8208;mediated tumor fibrosis and reverse 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1&#8208;kynurenine axis&#8208;involed&#160;T&#8208;cell exhaustion.








Abstract
The advance of immunotherapy has shifted the paradigm of cancer management in clinics. Nevertheless, a considerable subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients marginally respond to current immunotherapy due to the occurrence of dynamic immune evasion arising from intrinsic and therapeutic stress. In this investigation, the pivotal role of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF)&#8208;induced fibrosis and tumor cell&#8208;mediated T&#8208;cell exhaustion in driving the dynamic immune evasion is identified. Building upon this discovery, the authors herein engineer a novel peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC)&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator for mitigating dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The resulting nanoregulator can perform a two&#8208;stage morphology transformation from spherical micelle to nanofiber, and subsequently from nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles. Such kind of nanostructure design can facilitate differentialized delivery of CAF inhibitor in the extracellular matrix for intervening CAF&#8208;mediated tumor fibrosis, and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 inhibitor to tumor cells for relieving IDO1&#8208;kynurenine axis&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell exhaustion. Antitumor study with the self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator elicited persistent antitumor immunity and remarkable antitumor performance in both Panc02 and KPC tumor models in vivo. Taken together, the PDC&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator may provide a novel avenue for enhanced PDAC immunotherapy.

         <title>Modular Fabrication of Bioorthogonal Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal nanozymes facilitate in situ drug synthesis at disease sites through prodrug activation. This review investigates the role of nanomaterials in stabilizing and regulating transition metal catalysts (TMCs), emphasizing the modular design of nanomaterials and catalysts. It explores their synergistic engineering for efficient in situ uncaging of diagnostic and therapeutic agents.








Abstract
The incorporation of transition metal catalysts (TMCs) into nanoscaffolds generates nanocatalysts that replicate key aspects of enzymatic behavior. The TMCs can access bioorthogonal chemistry unavailable to living systems. These bioorthogonal nanozymes can be employed as in situ &#8220;factories&#8221; for generating bioactive molecules where needed. The generation of effective bioorthogonal nanozymes requires co&#8208;engineering of the TMC and the nanometric scaffold. This review presents an overview of recent advances in the field of bioorthogonal nanozymes, focusing on modular design aspects of both nanomaterial and catalyst and how they synergistically work together for in situ uncaging of imaging and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Research Progress in Donor&#8722;Acceptor Type Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the influence of structure on the performance of donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type covalent organic frameworks (COFs) in terms of linkage bonds and proposes various functionalization strategies to construct stable, high carrier transport and excellent optical properties of D&#8722;A type COFs. Moreover, the applications of D&#8722;A type COFs in catalytic chemical reactions, photothermal therapy, and electronic devices are introduced.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are new organic porous materials constructed by covalent bonds, with the advantages of pre&#8208;designable topology, adjustable pore size, and abundant active sites. Many research studies have shown that COFs exhibit great potential in gas adsorption, molecular separation, catalysis, drug delivery, energy storage, etc. However, the electrons and holes of intrinsic COF are prone to compounding in transport, and the carrier lifetime is short. The donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8722;A) type COFs, which are synthesized by introducing D and A units into the COFs backbone, combine separated electron and hole migration pathway, tunable band gap and optoelectronic properties of D&#8722;A type polymers with the unique advantages of COFs and have made great progress in related research in recent years. Here, the synthetic strategies of D&#8722;A type COFs are first outlined, including the rational design of linkages and D&#8722;A units as well as functionalization approaches. Then the applications of D&#8722;A type COFs in catalytic reactions, photothermal therapy, and electronic materials are systematically summarized. In the final section, the current challenges, and new directions for the development of D&#8722;A type COFs are presented.

Graphdiyne (GDY) and black phosphorus (BP) are assembled in parallel to form building blocks (GDY/BP/GDY). The GDY/BP/GDY building blocks contribute to the superior migration kinetics of lithium&#8208;ion and desirable pseudocapacitive behaviors. The GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;based electrode with multilevel layered architecture constructed by such building blocks stacking exhibits excellent high&#8208;rate performance and cycling stability.








Abstract
To achieve the high&#8208;performance of lithium&#8208;ion battery, the optimization of electrode materials has generally been considered as the one of the important methods. But most of those works pay attention to the new materials preparation or interface modification rather than the structural innovation. Here, an advanced electrode (GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;E) with multilevel layered architecture constructed by planar building blocks stacking structure has been designed and fabricated to explore the structure design of the electrode. This new structure is assembled by graphdiyne (GDY) and black phosphorus (BP) in parallel to form a building block (GDY/BP/GDY). The electric fields between the two GDY sides of the planar building block structure contribute to the superior migration dynamics of lithium ions and desirable pseudocapacitance behavior. Meanwhile, the planar stacking structure of GDY/BP/GDY can efficiently inhibit volume expansion of BP and a series of parasitic reactions of electrolytes during the long&#8208;term cycling. The advanced GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;E exhibits excellent high&#8208;rate performance (1418.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and cycling stability (391.7 mAh g&#8211;1 after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). Such structural design of electrode materials shows a new way to develop high&#8208;performance electrodes.

         <title>Stochastic Electrical Detection of Single Ion&#8208;Gated Semiconducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical measurements of individual semiconducting polymer chains in solution as they freely diffuse between nanogap electrodes are presented. Combined with mixed ionic&#8211;electronic charge transport, these experiments reveal changes in internal molecular configuration manifested as abrupt conductance fluctuations. This behavior is consistent with theoretical simulations based on the worm&#8208;like chain model for flexible polymers.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymer chains constitute the building blocks for a wide range of electronic materials and devices. However, most of their electrical characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level have received little attention. Elucidating these properties can help understanding performance limits and enable new applications. Here, coupled ionic&#8211;electronic charge transport is exploited to measure the quasi&#8208;1D electrical current through long single conjugated polymer chains as they form transient contacts with electrodes separated by &#8776;10&#160;nm. Fluctuations between internal conformations of the individual polymers are resolved as abrupt, multilevel switches in the electrical current. This behavior is consistent with the theoretical simulations based on the worm&#8208;like&#8208;chain (WLC) model for semiflexible polymers. In addition to probing the intrinsic properties of single semiconducting polymer chains, the results provide an unprecedented window into the dynamics of random&#8208;coil polymers and enable the use of semiconducting polymers as electrical labels for single&#8208;molecule (bio)sensing assays.

         <title>A Dynamically Stable Mixed Conducting Interphase for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries (ASSLMBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes have attracted increasing attention owing to their superior safety and high energy density. However, the instability of sulfide electrolytes against Li metal generally induces the formation of two types of incompetent interphases, that is, solid&#8208;state interphase (SEI) and mixed conducting interphase (MCI), which significantly blocks the rapid Li&#8208;ion transport and induces uneven Li metal deposition and continuous interface degradation. In this contribution, a dynamically stable mixed conducting interphase (S&#8208;MCI) is proposed by in&#8208;situ stress self&#8208;limiting reactions to achieve the compatibility of Li metal with composite sulfide electrolytes (Li6PS5Cl (LPSCl) and Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS)) and the suppression of Li dendrite penetration. The rational design of composite electrolyte utilizes the expansion stress after the decomposition of working electrolyte to in turn constrain the further continuous decomposition of LGPS. Consequently, the dense S&#8208;MCI inherits the high dynamical stability of LPSCl&#8208;derived SEI and lithiophilic affinity of Li&#8208;Ge alloy in LGPS&#8208;derived MCI. The Li||Li symmetric cells with the protection of S&#8208;MCI can operate stably for 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. The Li||NCM622 full cells present stable cycling for 100 cycles at 0.1 C with a high&#8208;capacity retention of 93.7%. This work sheds fresh insight into constructing electrochemically stable interphase for high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

         <title>A Lithium Intrusion&#8211;Blocking Interfacial Shield for Wide&#8211;Pressure&#8211;Range Solid&#8211;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium garnets are considered as promising solid&#8211;state electrolytes for next&#8211;generation solid&#8211;state Li metal batteries (SSLBs). However, the Li intrusion driven by external stack pressure triggers premature of Li metal batteries. Herein, for the first time, we report an in situ constructed interfacial shield to efficiently inhibit the pressure&#8211;induced Li intrusion in SSLBs. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that high&#8211;hardness metallic Mo nanocrystals inside the shield effectively suppress Li dendrite growth without alloy hardening&#8211;derived interfacial contact deterioration. Meanwhile the electrically insulated Li2S as a shield component considerably promotes interfacial wettability and hinders Li dendrite penetration into the bulk of garnet electrolyte. Interfacial shield&#8211;protected Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO)&#8211;based cells exhibit significantly enhanced cyclability without short circuits under conventional pressures of &#8776;0.2&#160;MPa and even at high pressure of up to 70&#160;MPa; which is the highest endurable stack pressure reported for SSLBs using garnet electrolytes. These key findings are expected to promote the wide&#8211;pressure&#8211;range applications of SSLBs.

         <title>Charge Dispersion Strategy for High&#8208;performance and Rain&#8208;proof Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is becoming a sustainable and renewable way of energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing, because of its low cost, simple structure, and high efficiency. However, the output current of existing TENGs is still low. We propose that the output current of TENGs could be dramatically improved if the triboelectric charges could distribute inside the triboelectric layers. Herein, we developed a novel single&#8208;electrode conductive network&#8208;based TENG (CN&#8208;TENG) by introducing a conductive network of multiwalled carbon nanotubes in dielectric triboelectric layer of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). In this CN&#8208;TENG, the contact electrification&#8208;induced charges distribute not only on the surface but also interior of the dielectric TPU layer. Thus, the short&#8208;circuit current of CN&#8208;TENG improved for 100 folds, compared with that of traditional dielectric TENG. Additionally, our CN&#8208;TENG, even without packing, can work stably in high&#8208;humidity environments and even in the rain, which is another main challenge for conventional TENGs due to charge leakage. Furthermore, our CN&#8208;TENG was applied, for the first time, to successfully distinguish conductive and dielectric materials. This work provides a new and effective strategy to fabricate TENGs with high output current and humidity&#8208;resistivity, greatly expanding their practical applications in energy harvesting, movement sensing, human&#8208;machine interaction, etc.

Abstract
Cascade catalytic reaction exhibits simple procedure and high efficiency, such as that from the orderly assembly of different enzymes in biological systems. Mimicking of the natural cascade procedure becomes critical, but the orderly assembly of different enzymes is still challenging. Herein, we reported single Au&#8208;Pt nanozyme with &#8220;three&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; functions to initiate cascade conversions for O2 supply as mimic catalase, H2O2 production with its glucose oxidase&#8208;like property, and &#8226;OH generation as mimic peroxidase for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Thus, the complex assembly and cross&#8208;talk among the different enzymes are avoided. To this end, metastable Cu2O NPs, as scaffolds, are used to anchor ultrasmall Au&#8208;Pt nanozyme, while metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) is used to encapsulate the nanozyme for tumor microenvironment (TME) response and shielding protein adsorption. Pluronic&#174; F127 is then modified on the surface to improve hydrophilicity and biocompatibility of the composite. The endogenous acidity and glutathione in tumor degrade MOF to expose nanozyme for cascade catalytic CDT. The high photothermal conversion ability of the composite also enhances the CDT, while Cu2+ ions consume GSH to further improve CDT efficiency as augmented cascade catalytic tumor therapy. Thus, we provide a new paradigm with drug&#8208;free single nanozyme for improving tumor therapeutic efficacy and minimizing side effects.

         <title>An Industrially Applicable Passivation Strategy for Significantly Improving Cyclability of Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The cycling instability of metallic Zn anodes hinders the practicability of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries, though aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries may be the most credible alternative technology for future electrochemical energy storage applications. Commercially available trivalent chromium conversion films (TCCF) were successfully employed as robust artificial interphases on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Fabricated through a simple immersion method, the TCCF&#8208;protected Zn (TCCF@Zn) electrode enables a super&#8208;low nucleation overpotential for Zn plating of 6.9&#160;mV under 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outstanding Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1600 cycles in Zn||Cu asymmetric cells and superior cyclability in symmetric Zn||Zn batteries at 0.2, 2 and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 2500&#160;h and 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1200&#160;h. More importantly, the TCCF@Zn||V2O5 full cell exhibited a specific capacity of 118.5 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 53.4% at 3 A g&#8722;1 for 3000 cycles, which is considerably larger than that of the pristine Zn||V2O5 full cell (59.7 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention of 25.7%). This study demonstrates a highly efficient and low&#8208;cost surface modification strategy derived from an industrially applicable trivalent chromium passivation technique aimed at obtaining dendrite&#8208;free ZMAs with high reversibility for practical Zn batteries in the near future.

         <title>Ultrasound Nanobubble Coupling Agent for Effective Non&#8208;Invasive Deep&#8208;Layer Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional coupling agents (such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, methylcellulose, and polyurethane) are unable to efficiently transport drugs through the skin's dual barriers (the epidermal cuticle barrier and the basement membrane barrier between the epidermis and dermis) when exposed to ultrasound, hindering deep and non&#8208;invasive transdermal drug delivery. In this study, nanobubbles prepared by the double emulsification method and aminated hyaluronic acid were crosslinked with aldehyde&#8208;based hyaluronic acid by dynamic covalent bonding through the Schiff base reaction to produce an innovative ultrasound&#8208;nanobubble coupling agent. By amplifying the cavitation effect of ultrasound, drugs can be efficiently transferred through the double barrier of the skin and delivered to deep layers. In an in vitro model of isolated porcine skin, this agent achieved an effective penetration depth of 728&#160;&#956;m with the parameters of ultrasound set at 2&#160;W, 650&#160;kHz, and 50% duty cycle for 20&#160;min. Consequently, drugs can be efficiently delivered to deeper layers non&#8208;invasively. In summary, this ultrasound nanobubble coupling agent efficiently achieves deep&#8208;layer drug delivery by amplifying the ultrasonic cavitation effect and penetrating the double barriers, heralding a new era for non&#8208;invasive drug delivery platforms and disease treatment.

         <title>Digital Mechanical Metamaterial: Encoding Mechanical Information with Graphical Stiffness Pattern for Adaptive Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by the adaptive features exhibited by biological organisms like the octopus, soft machines that can tune their shape and mechanical properties have shown great potential in applications involving unstructured and continuously changing environments. However, current soft machines are far from achieving the same level of adaptability as their biological counterparts, hampered by limited real&#8208;time tunability and severely deficient reprogrammable space of properties and functionalities. As a steppingstone toward fully adaptive soft robots and smart interactive machines, this work introduces an encodable multifunctional material that uses graphical stiffness patterns to in situ program versatile mechanical capabilities without requiring additional infrastructure. Through independently switching the digital binary stiffness states (soft or rigid) of individual constituent units of a simple auxetic structure with elliptical voids, this work demonstrates in situ and gradational tunability in various mechanical qualities such as shape&#8208;shifting and &#8208;memory, stress&#8208;strain response, and Poisson's ratio under compressive load, as well as application&#8208;oriented functionalities such as tunable and reusable energy absorption and pressure delivery. This digitally programmable material is expected to pave the way toward multi&#8208;environment soft robots and interactive machines.

         <title>Cd&#8208;Free Pure Sulfide Kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 Solar Cell with Over 800&#160;mV Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Enabled by Phase Evolution Intervention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Cd&#8208;free Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) solar cell is an ideal candidate for producing low&#8208;cost clean energy through green materials owing to its inherent environmental friendliness and earth abundance. Nevertheless, sulfide CZTS has long suffered from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficits, limiting the full exploitation of performance potential and further progress. Here, we propose an effective strategy to alleviate the non&#8208;radiative VOC loss by manipulating the phase evolution during the critical kesterite phase formation stage. With a Ge cap layer on the precursor, premature CZTS grain formation is suppressed at low temperatures, leading to fewer nucleation centers at the initial crystallization stage. Consequently, the CZTS grain formation and crystallization are deferred to high temperatures, resulting in enhanced grain interior quality and less unfavorable grain boundaries in the final film. As a result, a champion efficiency of 10.7% for Cd&#8208;free CZTS solar cells with remarkably high VOC beyond 800&#160;mV (63.2% Schockley&#8208;Queisser limit) is realized, indicating that non&#8208;radiative recombination is effectively inhibited. This strategy may advance other compound semiconductors seeking high&#8208;quality crystallization.

         <title>Fully Recyclable Cured Polymers for Sustainable 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most prevalent materials used in the Additive Manufacturing era are polymers and plastics. Unfortunately, these materials are recognized for their negative environmental impact as they are primarily non&#8208;recyclable, resulting in environmental pollution. In recent years, a new sustainable alternative to these materials has been emerging: reversible covalent bond&#8208;containing polymers (RCBPs). These materials can be recycled, reprocessed, and reused multiple times without losing their properties. Nonetheless, they have two significant drawbacks when used in 3D printing. First, some require adding new materials every reprinting cycle, and second, others require high temperatures for (re)printing, limiting recyclability and increasing energy consumption. This study, thus, introduces fully recyclable RCBPs as a sustainable approach for radiation&#8208;based printing technologies. This approach enables multiple (re)printing cycles at low temperatures (50 &#176;C lower than the lowest reported) without adding new materials. It involves purposefully synthesized polymers that undergo reversible photopolymerization, composed of a tin&#8208;based catalyst. An everyday microwave oven quickly de&#8208;polymerized these polymers, obtaining complete reversibility.

         <title>Mesostructured Materials with Controllable Long&#8208;Range Orientational Ordering And Anisotropic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inorganic&#8208;organic mesophase materials provide a wide range of tunable properties, which are often highly dependent on their nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, or meso&#8208;scale compositions and structures. Among these are macroscopic orientational order and corresponding anisotropic material properties, the adjustability of which are difficult to achieve. This is due to the complicated transient and coupled transport, chemical reaction, and surface processes that occur during materials syntheses. By understanding such processes, general criteria are established and used to prepare diverse mesostructured materials with highly aligned channels with uniform nanometer dimensions and controllable directionalities over macroscopic dimensions and thicknesses. This is achieved by using a micropatterned semipermeable poly(dimethylsiloxane) stamp to manage the rates, directions, and surfaces at which self&#8208;assembling phases nucleate and the directions that they grow. This enables mesostructured surfactant&#8208;directed silica and titania composites, including with functional guest species, and mesoporous carbons to be prepared with high degrees of hexagonal order, as well as controllable orthogonal macroscopic orientational order. The resulting materials exhibit novel anisotropic properties, as demonstrated by the example of direction&#8208;dependent photocurrent generation, and are promising for enhancing the functionality of inorganic&#8208;organic nanocomposite materials in separations, catalysis, and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Growth, Distribution, and Photosynthesis of Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii in 3d Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineered living materials (ELMs) are a novel class of functional materials that typically feature spatial confinement of living components within an inert polymer matrix to recreate biological functions. Understanding the growth and spatial configuration of cellular populations within a matrix is crucial to predicting and improving their responsive potential and functionality. Here, we investigate the growth, spatial distribution, and photosynthetic productivity of eukaryotic microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in three&#8208;dimensionally shaped hydrogels in dependence of geometry and size. The embedded C. reinhardtii cells photosynthesize and form confined cell clusters, which grow faster when located close to the ELM periphery due to favorable gas exchange and light conditions. Taking advantage of location&#8208;specific growth patterns, we successfully design and print photosynthetic ELMs with increased CO2 capturing rate, featuring high surface to volume ratio. This strategy to control cell growth for higher productivity of ELMs resembles the already established adaptations found in multicellular plant leaves.

         <title>Photoinduced Nonvolatile Memory Transistor Based on Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Incorporating Fused &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Organic Ligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskites field&#8208;effect transistors (PeFETs) have been intensively investigated for their application in detector and synapse. However, synapse based on PeFETs is still very difficult to integrate excellent charge carrier transporting ability, photosensitivity and nonvolatile memory effects into one device, which is very important for developing bionic electronic devices and edge computing. Here, two&#8208;dimensional perovskites were synthesized by incorporating fused &#960;&#8209;conjugated pyrene&#8208;O&#8208;ethyl&#8208;ammonium (POE) ligands and a systematic study was conducted to obtain enhanced performance and reliable PeFETs. The optimized (POE)2SnI4 transistors display the hole mobility over 0.3 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, high repeatability and operational stability. Meanwhile, the derived photo memory devices show remarkable photoresponse, with a switching ratio higher than 105, high visible light responsivity (&gt;4&#215;104 A/W), and stable storage&#8208;erase cycles, as well as competitive retention performance (104 s). The photoinduced memory behavior can be benefiting from the insulating nature of quantum&#8208;well in 2D perovskite under dark and its excellent light sensitivity. The excellent photo memory behaviors have been maintained after 40 days in a N2 atmosphere. Finally, a 2D perovskite&#8208;only transistors with a multi&#8208;level memory behavior (16 distinct states) was described by controlling incident light pulse. This work provides broader attention toward 2D perovskite and optoelectronic application.

         <title>Bandgap Engineering of Melon using Highly Reduced Graphene Oxide for Enhanced Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bandgap of melon is engineered with highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG). 1% HRG@melon nanocomposite shows a higher photocurrent density (71 &#181;A cm&#8722;2) in alkaline conditions than melon (24 &#181;A cm&#8722;2), which is increased with a hole scavenger to 630 &#181;A cm&#8722;2. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the addition of HRG leads to an improved photocatalytic HER via charge redistribution.









Abstract
The uncondensed form of polymeric carbon nitrides (PCN), generally known as melon, is a stacked 2D structure of poly(aminoimino)heptazine. Melon is used as a photocatalyst in solar energy conversion applications, but suffers from poor photoconversion efficiency due to weak optical absorption in the visible spectrum, high activation energy, and inefficient separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Experimental and theoretical studies are reported to engineer the bandgap of melon with highly reduced graphene oxide (HRG). Three HRG@melon nanocomposites with different HRG:melon ratios (0.5%, 1%, and 2%) are&#160;prepared. The 1% HRG@melon nanocomposite shows higher photocurrent density (71&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) than melon (24&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) in alkaline conditions. The addition of a hole scavenger further increases the photocurrent density to 630&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). These experimental results are&#160;validated by calculations using density functional theory (DFT), which revealed that HRG results in a significant charge redistribution and an improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

         <title>Genetically Encoded Oligomerization for Protein&#8208;Based Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of proteins into optoelectronics offers a novel approach toward the development of eco&#8208;friendly materials, replacing non&#8208;sustainable elements while maintaining device efficiency. In this work, a genetically&#8208;encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy which enables versatile, electrostatic&#8208;controlled protein&#8211;protein interactions, ensuring the protein stability in non&#8208;native environments and stressful conditions, is developed.








Abstract
Implementing proteins in optoelectronics represents a fresh idea toward a sustainable new class of materials with bio&#8208;functions that can replace environmentally unfriendly and/or toxic components without losing device performance. However, their native activity (fluorescence, catalysis, and so on) is easily lost under device fabrication/operation as non&#8208;native environments (organic solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, and so on) and severe stress (temperature, irradiation, and so on) are involved. Herein, a gift bow genetically&#8208;encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy is showcased to promote protein&#8211;protein solid interaction enabling i) high versatility with arbitrary proteins, ii) straightforward electrostatic driven control of the macro&#8208;oligomer size by ionic strength, and iii) stabilities over months in pure organic solvents and stress scenarios, allowing to integrate them into classical water&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based materials/components for optoelectronics. Indeed, rainbow&#8208;/white&#8208;emitting protein&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, attesting a first&#8208;class performance compared to those with their respective native proteins: significantly enhanced device stabilities from a few minutes up to 100&#160;h keeping device efficiency at high power driving conditions. Thus, the oligomerization concept is a solid bridge between biological systems and materials/components to meet expectations in bio&#8208;optoelectronics, in general, and lighting schemes, in particular.

Recyclable and robust fluorescent probes are constructed based on lanthanide&#8208;doped nanocomposites and thermostable engineered enzymes. The probes can be easily reused more than ten times and stored in a warm environment (37&#160;&#176;C for 10 days). This saves resources, reduces costs, and lowers storage requirements to realize sustainable diagnostics that meet the World Health Organization criteria for ideal tests.








Abstract
Recyclable fluorescence assays that can be stored at room temperature would greatly benefit biomedical diagnostics by bringing sustainability and cost&#8208;efficiency, especially for point&#8208;of&#8208;care serodiagnostics in developing regions. Here, a general strategy is proposed to generate recyclable fluorescent probes by using engineered enzymes with enhanced thermo&#8208;/chemo&#8208;stability, which maintains an outstanding serodiagnostic performance (accuracy &gt;95%) after 10 times of recycling as well as after storage at elevated temperatures (37 &#176;C for 10 days). With these three outstanding properties, recyclable fluorescent probes can be designed to detect various biomarkers of clinical importance by using different enzymes.

         <title>Hapten/Myristoyl Functionalized Poly(propyleneimine) Dendrimers as Potent Cell Surface Recruiters of Antibodies for Mediating Innate Immune Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an innovative approach to enhance immune&#8208;mediated cancer cell killing. Poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers functionalized with cell membrane anchoring motifs and motifs recruiting endogenous anti&#8208;hapten antibodies exhibit exceptional antibody&#8208;recruiting capacity. In vitro experiments demonstrate efficient dendrimer&#8208;mediated binding of antibodies to cancer cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Intratumoral injection in mice successfully induces recruitment of anti&#8208;hapten antibodies into solid tumors.








Abstract
Recruiting endogenous antibodies to the surface of cancer cells using antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules has the potential to unleash innate immune effector killing mechanisms against antibody&#8208;bound cancer cells. The affinity of endogenous antibodies is relatively low, and many currently explored antibody&#8208;recruiting strategies rely on targeting over&#8208;expressed receptors, which have not yet been identified in most solid tumors. Here, both challenges are addressed by functionalizing poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimers with both multiple dinitrophenyl (DNP) motifs, as anti&#8208;hapten antibody&#8208;recruiting motifs, and myristoyl motifs, as universal phospholipid cell membrane anchoring motifs, to recruit anti&#8208;hapten antibodies to cell surfaces. By exploiting the multivalency of the ligand exposure on the dendrimer scaffold, it is demonstrated that dendrimers featuring ten myristoyl and six DNP motifs exhibit the highest antibody&#8208;recruiting capacity in vitro. Furthermore, it is shown that treating cancer cells with these dendrimers in vitro marks them for phagocytosis by macrophages in the presence of anti&#8208;hapten antibodies. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that intratumoral injection of these dendrimers in vivo in tumor&#8208;bearing mice results in the recruitment of anti&#8208;DNP antibodies to the cell surface in the tumor microenvironment. These findings highlight the potential of dendrimers as a promising class of novel antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules for use in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Targeting Dna Damage and Repair Machinery via Delivering WEE1 Inhibitor and Platinum (IV) Prodrugs to Stimulate Sting Pathway for Maximizing Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Both cisplatin&#8208;based chemotherapy and immune checkpoint blockers (ICBs)&#8208;based immunotherapy are the first&#8208;line treatments for patients with advanced bladder cancer. Cancer cells can develop resistance to cisplatin through extensive DNA repair, while a low response rate to ICBs is mostly due to the presence of an immunosuppressive microenvironment and low PD&#8208;L1 expression. Herein, a glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP2) loaded with cisplatin prodrug (Pt (IV)) and WEE1 inhibitor (MK1775) was designed. NP2 can be triggered by GSH in cancer cells, and the released MK1775 can inhibit the activity of WEE1 protein, which ultimately increased DNA damage by cisplatin. Genome&#8208;wide RNA sequencing first revealed that NP2 could inhibit DNA repair machinery by interfering with the cell cycle and significantly activate the Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by NP2 in vivo. As innate and adaptive immune responses were stimulated, the immunosuppressive microenvironment was modified, and the &#8220;immune cold tumor&#8221; was transformed into an &#8220;immune hot tumor&#8221;. In addition, NP2 could upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression in tumor cells, thereby increasing the response rate of PD&#8208;L1 monoclonal antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1) and eliciting long&#8208;term immune responses in both primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Reducing Gases Triggered Cathode Surface Reconstruction for Stable Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interface in Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The interfacial compatibility between cathode materials and sulfide solid&#8208;electrolytes (SEs) is a critical limiting factor of electrochemical performance in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ASSLBs). In response to this challenge, this work presents a novel approach: the development of a gas&#8208;solid interface reduction reaction (GSIRR). This GSIRR process aims to mitigate the reactivity of surface oxygen by inducing a surface reconstruction layer (SRL) through an in&#8208;situ generated metal oxide on the surface of layered oxide cathode's surface. Experimental results exhibit a substantial reduction in interfacial side reactions with sulfide SEs, leading to a notable decrease in interface resistance. A specific example involves the application of a SRL, CoO/Li2CO3, onto LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode. This modification results in impressive outcomes, including high capacity (149.7 mAh g&#8722;1), remarkable cyclability (retention of 84.63% over 400 cycles at 0.2C), outstanding rate capability (86.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2C), and exceptional stability in high&#8208;loading cathode (28.97 and 23.45&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) within ASSLBs. Furthermore, the SRL CoO/Li2CO3 enhances the interfacial stability between LCO and Li10GeP2S12 as well as Li3PS4 SEs. Significantly, our experiments suggest that the GSIRR mechanism can be broadly applied, not only to LCO cathodes but also to LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes and other reducing gases like H2S and CO, indicating its practical universality. This study highlights the significant influence of the surface chemistry of the oxide cathode on interfacial compatibility, and introduces a surface reconstruction strategy based on the GSIRR process as a promising avenue for designing enhanced ASSLBs.

         <title>Band Structure Engineering And Orbital Orientation Control Constructing Dual Active Sites For Efficient Sulfur Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The kinetics difference among multi&#8208;step sulfur electrochemical processes leads to the accumulation of soluble polysulfides and thus shuttle effect in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries. While the interaction between catalysts and representative species has been reported, the root of the kinetics difference, interaction change among redox reactions, remains unclear, which significantly impedes the rational design of catalysts for Li&#8722;S batteries. Here, we apply density functional theory to decipher the interaction change among electrocatalytic sulfur reactions, using tungsten disulfide (WS2) a model system to demonstrate the efficiency of modifying electrocatalytic selectivity via dual&#8208;coordination design. Band structure engineering and orbital orientation control are combined to guide the design of WS2 with boron dopants and sulfur vacancies (B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x), accurately modulating interaction with lithium and sulfur sites in polysulfide species for relatively higher interaction with short&#8208;chain polysulfides (Li2S4 and Li2S2). The modified interaction trend is experimentally confirmed by distinguishing the kinetics of each electrochemical reaction step, indicating the effectiveness of the designed strategy. An Ah&#8208;level pouch cell with B&#8722;WS2&#8722;x delivers a gravimetric energy density of up to 417.6 Wh&#8201;kg&#8722;1 with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 3.6&#160;&#956;L mg&#8722;1 and negative/positive capacity ratio of approximately 1.2. This work presents a dual&#8208;coordination strategy for advancing evolutionarily catalytic activity, offering a rational strategy to develop effective catalysts for practical Li&#8722;S batteries

         <title>Halide Heterogeneous Structure Boosting Ionic Diffusion and High&#8208;Voltage Stability of Sodium Superionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SSSBs) heavily hinges on the development of a Na+ conductor (SSC) that features high conductivity, (electro)chemical stability, and deformability. The construction of heterogeneous structures offers a promising approach to comprehensively enhancing these properties in a way that differs from traditional structural optimization. Here, we exploit the structural variance between high&#8208; and low&#8208;coordination halide frameworks to develop a new class of halide heterogeneous structure electrolytes (HSEs). The halide HSEs incorporating a UCl3&#8208;type high&#8208;coordination framework and amorphous low&#8208;coordination phase achieved the highest Na+ conductivity (2.7 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature) among halide SSCs so far. By discerning the individual contribution of the crystalline bulk, amorphous region, and interface, we unravel the synergistic ion conduction within halide HSEs and provide a comprehensive explanation of the amorphization effect. More importantly, the excellent deformability, high&#8208;voltage stability, and expandability of HSEs enable effective SSSB integration. Using a cold&#8208;pressed cathode electrode composite of uncoated Na0.85Mn0.5Ni0.4Fe0.1O2 and HSEs, the SSSBs present stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 91.0% after 100 cycles at 0.2 C.

         <title>Antibacterial and Angiogenic (2A) Bio&#8208;Heterojunctions Facilitate Infectious Ischemic Wound Regeneration via an Endogenous&#8208;Exogenous Bistimulatory Strategy</title>

Abstract
In infectious ischemic wounds, a lack of blood perfusion significantly worsens microbe&#8208;associated infection symptoms and frequently complicates healing. To overcome this daunting issue, we devise and develop antibacterial and angiogenic (2A) bio&#8208;heterojunctions (bio&#8208;HJs) consisting of CuS/MXene heterojunctions and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;mimicking peptide (VMP), to accelerate infectious cutaneous regeneration by boosting angiogenesis via an endogenous&#8208;exogenous bistimulatory (EEB) strategy. Assisted by near&#8208;infrared irradiation, the bio&#8208;HJ platform exhibits versatile synergistic photothermal, photodynamic, and chemodynamic effects for robust antibacterial efficacy. In addition, copper ions liberated from 2A bio&#8208;HJs elevate VEGF secretion from fibroblasts, which provokes VEGF receptors (VEGFR) activation through an endogenous pathway, whereas VMP itself promotes an exogenous pathway to facilitate endothelial cell multiplication and tube formation by directly activating the VEGFR signaling pathway. Moreover, employing an in vivo model of infectious ischemic wounds, we confirm that the EEB strategy can considerably boost cutaneous regeneration through pathogen elimination, angiogenesis promotion, and collagen deposition. As envisaged, this work leads to the development of a powerful 2A bio&#8208;HJ platform that can serve as an effective remedy for bacterial invasion&#8208;induced ischemic wounds through the EEB strategy.

         <title>Rejuvenating Aged Bone Repair Through Multihierarchy Reaction Oxygen Species&#8208;Regulated Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aging exacerbates the dysfunction of tissue regeneration at multiple levels and gradually diminishes individual's capacity to withstand stress, damage, and disease. The excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a hallmark feature of senescent stem cells, which causes oxidative stress, deteriorates the host microenvironment, and eventually becomes a critical obstacle for aged bone defect repair. Till now, the strategies cannot synchronously and thoroughly regulate intracellular and extracellular ROS in senescent cells. Herein, we developed a multihierarchy ROS scavenging system for aged bone regeneration by fabricating an injectable PEGylated poly(glycerol sebacate) (PEGS&#8208;NH2)/poly(&#947;&#8208;glutamic acid) (&#947;&#8208;PGA) hydrogel hydrogel containing rapamycin&#8208;loaded poly(diselenide&#8208;carbonate) nanomicelles (PSeR). This PSeR hydrogel exhibited highly sensitive ROS responsiveness to the local aged microenvironment and dynamically released drug&#8208;loaded nanomicelles to scavenge the intracellular ROS accumulated in senescent bone mesenchymal stem cells. The PSeR hydrogel effectively tuned the antioxidant function and delayed senescence of bone mesenchymal stem cells by safeguarding DNA replication in an oxidative environment, thereby promoting the self&#8208;renewal ability and enhancing the osteogenic capacity for aged bone repair in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this multihierarchy ROS&#8208;regulated hydrogel provides a new strategy for treating degenerative diseases.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered UV Photodetector With Ultrahigh Responsivity Based on 2D Perovskite Ferroelectric Films With Mixed Spacer Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations (BA+ and BDA2+) are prepared for self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PDs). The self&#8208;powered ultraviolet (UV) PDs exhibit excellent photoelectric properties, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. After applying pressures to the PD, the maximum responsivities can be modulated by the piezo&#8211;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered photodetectors (PDs) have the advantages of no external power requirement, wireless operation, and long life. Spontaneous ferroelectric polarizations can significantly increase built&#8208;in electric field intensity, showing great potential in self&#8208;powered photodetection. Moreover, ferroelectrics possess pyroelectric and piezoelectric properties, beneficial for enhancing self&#8208;powered PDs. 2D metal halide perovskites (MHPs), which have ferroelectric properties, are suitable for fabricating high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered PDs. However, the research on 2D metal halide perovskites ferroelectrics focuses on growing bulk crystals. Herein, 2D ferroelectric perovskite films with mixed spacer cations for self&#8208;powered PDs are demonstrated by mixing Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP)&#8208;type and Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;type perovskite. The (BDA0.7(BA2)0.3)(EA)2Pb3Br10 film possesses, overall, the best film qualities with the best crystalline quality, lowest trap density, good phase purity, and obvious ferroelectricity. Based on the ferro&#8211;pyro&#8211;phototronic effect, the PD at 360&#160;nm exhibits excellent photoelectric properties, with an ultrahigh peak responsivity greater than 93 A W&#8722;1 and a detectivity of 2.5 &#215; 1015 Jones, together with excellent reproducibility and stability. The maximum responsivities can be modulated by piezo&#8211;phototronic effect with an effective enhancement ratio of 480%. This work will open up a new route of designing MHP ferroelectric films for high&#8208;performance PDs and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various optoelectronics applications.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanofilms for High&#8208;Performance Resistive Memory Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanofilms with smooth surface, good crystallinity, and high orientation are successfully fabricated and employed in resistive memory devices. The resulting memristors demonstrate excellent switching behavior. More strikingly, the scratched HOF film can be readily regenerated through a simple solvent rinsing process, enabling their reuse for the fabrication of new memristors.








Abstract
The integration of hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) into electronic devices holds great promise due to their high crystallinity, intrinsic porosity, and easy regeneration. However, despite their potential, the utilization of HOFs in electronic&#160;devices remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges associated with fabricating high&#8208;quality films. Herein, a controlled synthesis of HOF&#160;nanofilms with smooth surface, good crystallinity, and high orientation is achieved using a solution&#8208;processed approach. The memristors exhibit outstanding bipolar switching performance with a&#160;low set voltage of 0.86&#160;V, excellent retention of 1.64 &#215; 104 s, and operational endurance of 60 cycles. Additionally, these robust memristors display remarkable thermal stability, maintaining their performance even at elevated temperatures of up to 200 &#176;C. More strikingly, scratched HOF&#160;films can be readily regenerated through a simple solvent rinsing process, enabling their reuse for the fabrication of new memristors, which is difficult to achieve with traditional resistive switching materials. Additionally, a switching mechanism based on the reversible formation and annihilation of conductive filaments is revealed. This work provides novel and invaluable insights that have a significant impact on advancing the widespread adoption of HOFs as active layers in electronic devices.

         <title>Challenges and Advances in Rechargeable Batteries for Extreme&#8208;Condition Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are widely used as power sources for portable electronics, electric vehicles and smart grids. Their practical performances are, however, largely undermined under extreme conditions, such as in high&#8208;altitude drones, ocean exploration and polar expedition. These extreme environmental conditions not only bring new challenges for batteries but also incur unique battery failure mechanisms. To fill in the gap, it is of great importance to understand the battery failure mechanisms under different extreme conditions and figure out the key parameters that limit battery performances. In this review, we start by investigating the key challenges from the viewpoints of ionic/charge transfer, material/interface evolution and electrolyte degradation under different extreme conditions. It is then followed by different engineering approaches through electrode materials design, electrolyte modification and battery component optimization to enhance practical battery performances. Finally, a short perspective is provided about the future development of rechargeable batteries under extreme conditions.

         <title>Inhibiting Endothelial Cell&#8208;Mediated T Lymphocyte Apoptosis with Integrin&#8208;Targeting Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate Filaments for Chemoimmunotherapy of Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>

Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells (TECs) limit anti&#8208;tumor immunity via inducing apoptosis of infiltrating T lymphocytes through a Fas ligand (FasL)&#8208;mediated mechanism. Herein, we create a peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC) by linking 7&#8208;ethyl&#8208;10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (SN38) to hydrophilic segments with either RGDR or HKD motif at their C&#8208;terminus through a glutathione&#8208;responsive linker. The PDCs spontaneously assemble into filaments in aqueous solution. The PDC filaments containing 1% of SN38&#8208;RGDR (SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR) effectively target triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and TECs with upregulated expression of integrin, and induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and FasL down&#8208;regulation of TECs. SN38&#8208;HKD/RGDR increases infiltration, activity, and viability of CD8+ T cells, and thus inhibits the growth of primary tumors and pulmonary metastasis. This study highlights the synergistic modulation of cancerous cells and TECs with integrin&#8208;targeting PDC filaments as a promising strategy for TNBC chemoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Lowering the Temperature of Solid Oxide Electrochemical Cells Using Triple&#8208;Doped Bismuth Oxides.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite the great potential of solid oxide electrochemical cells (SOCs) as highly efficient energy conversion devices, the undesirable high operating temperature has limited their wider applicability. Herein, a novel approach to developing high&#8208;performance low&#8208;temperature SOCs (LT&#8208;SOCs) is presented through the use of an Er, Y, and Zr triple&#8208;doped bismuth oxide (EYZB). This study demonstrates that EYZB exhibits &gt;147 times higher ionic conductivity of 0.44 S/cm at 600&#176;C compared to commercial Y&#8208;stabilized zirconia electrolyte with excellent stability over 1000&#160;h. By rationally incorporating EYZB in composite electrodes and bilayer electrolytes, the zirconia&#8208;based electrolyte LT&#8208;SOC achieves the unprecedentedly high performance of 3.45 and 2.02&#160;W/cm2 in the fuel cell mode and 2.08 and 0.95 A/cm2 in the electrolysis cell mode at 700 and 600&#176;C, respectively. Further, a distinctive microstructural feature of EYZB that largely extends triple phase boundary at the interface is revealed through digital twinning. This work provides insights for developing high&#8208;performance LT&#8208;SOCs.

         <title>Strain Induced Electronic Structure Modulation on MnO2 Nanosheet by Ir Incorporation for Efficient Water Oxidation in Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxygen electrochemistry plays a key role in renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, but its slow kinetics limits the performance and the commercialization of such devices. Here, a strained MnO2 nanosheet induced by Ir incorporation was developed with optimized electronic structure by a simple hydrothermal method. With the incorporation of Ir, the strain induces elongated Mn&#8208;O bond length, and thereby tuning the electronic structure to favor the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. The obtained catalyst exhibits an excellent mass activity of 5681 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4, and reaches 50 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at overpotentials of only 240 and 277&#160;mV, respectively. The catalyst is also stable even at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Using the nanosheet as the OER catalyst and the Pt/C as the hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst, a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer achieves 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with only a cell voltage of 1.453&#160;V for overall water splitting in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. This strategy enables the material with high feasibility for practical applications on hydrogen production.

         <title>Spatially Selective Solvation Structure by Electronegative Micro&#8208;Arrays for Stable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
For electrolytes with conventional lithium salt concentration, it is not easy to generate sufficient anion&#8208;derived beneficial inorganic components to stabilize the electrolyte&#8208;lithium metal anode interface due to the repulsion of the free state anions by the anode. In this study, we solve the above issues through the strong interaction between electronegative materials and lithium ions (Li+). A locally high Li+ concentration strategy is proposed by preparing micro&#8208;arrays of electronegative nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (nHA) on the Cu foil. It is found that the O atoms in &#8208;PO4 functional groups of the nHA can strongly adsorb Li+ to form locally Li+&#8208;rich region, which increases the probability of anions to interact with Li+. The formation of more Li+&#8208;coordinated anions at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface can reduce the Li+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier, and enable the anions to completely decompose into lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium nitride (Li3N) on Li metal anode. The interfacial transfer dynamics is accelerated and the Li dendrites are effectively suppressed. Under high current density, the anode exhibits long lifespan with high Coulombic efficiency and small polarization voltage. The nHA micro&#8208;arrays achieve the targeted solvation structure at the electrolyte&#8208;anode interface, while ensuring conventional lithium salt concentration in the bulk electrolyte.

         <title>Control of Mechanical and Fracture Properties in Two&#8208;Phase Materials Reinforced by Continuous, Irregular Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Composites with high strength and high fracture resistance are desirable for structural and protective applications. Most composites, however, suffer from poor damage tolerance and are prone to unpredictable fractures. Understanding the behavior of materials with an irregular reinforcement phase offers fundamental guidelines for tailoring their performance. Here, we study the fracture nucleation and propagation in two phase composites, as a function of the topology of their irregular microstructures. We use a stochastic algorithm to design the polymeric reinforcing network, achieving independent control of topology and geometry of the microstructure. By tuning the local connectivity of isodense tiles and their assembly into larger structures, we tailor the mechanical and fracture properties of the architected composites, at the local and global scale. Finally, combining different reinforcing networks into a spatially determined meso&#8208;scale assembly, we demonstrate how the spatial propagation of fractures in architected composite materials can be designed and controlled a priori.

         <title>Wireless and Closed&#8208;Loop Smart Dressing for Exudate Management and On&#8208;Demand Treatment of Chronic Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional wearable patch is synthetically integrated to absorb exudates, monitor wound status, and personalize treatment. The designed multifunctional integrated intelligent wound dressing (IWD) is suitable for different wound sizes and provides a basic platform reference for chronic wound treatment.








Abstract
Chronic wounds have become a significant threat to people's physical and mental health and have increased the burden of social medical care. Intelligent wound dressing (IWD) with wound condition monitoring and closed&#8208;loop on&#8208;demand drug therapy can shorten the healing process and alleviate patient suffering. However, single&#8208;function wound dressings cannot meet the current needs of chronic wound treatment. Here, a wearable IWD consisting of wound exudate management, sensor monitoring, closed&#8208;loop therapy, and flexible circuit modules is reported, which can achieve effective synergy between wound exudate management and on&#8208;demand wound therapy. The dressing is attached to the wound site, and the wound exudate is spontaneously pumped into the microfluidic channel for storage. Meanwhile, the IWD can detect the state of the wound through the temperature and humidity sensor, and use this as feedback to control the liquid metal (LM) heater through a smartphone, thereby realizing the on&#8208;demand drug release from the hydrogel. In a mouse model of infected wounds, IWD accelerates wound healing by reducing inflammatory responses, promoting angiogenesis and collagen deposition.

         <title>Insights into the Si&#9472;H Bonding Configuration at the Amorphous/Crystalline Silicon Interface of Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells by Raman and FTIR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that Raman spectroscopy can be used to investigate the silicon&#8208;hydrogen (Si&#9472;H) bonding configuration of thinhydrogenated amorphous silicon layers directly on silicon heterojunction solar cells. Additionally, a detailed comparison of the Si&#8211;H vibrational spectra near the amorphous/crystalline silicon interface measured by Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy is performed.








Abstract
In silicon heterojunction solar cell technology, thin layers of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) are applied as passivating contacts to the crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) wafer. Thus, the properties of the a&#8208;Si:H is crucial for the performance of the solar cells. One important property of a&#8208;Si:H is its microstructure which can be characterized by the microstructure parameter R based on Si&#9472;H bond stretching vibrations. A common method to determine R is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption measurement which, however, is difficult to perform on solar cells for various reasons like the use of textured Si wafers and the presence of conducting oxide contact layers. Here, it is demonstrated that Raman spectroscopy is suitable to determine the microstructure of bulk a&#8208;Si:H layers of 10&#160;nm or less on textured c&#8208;Si underneath indium tin oxide as conducting oxide. A detailed comparison of FTIR and Raman spectra is performed and significant differences in the microstructure parameter are obtained by both methods with decreasing a&#8208;Si:H film thickness.

         <title>Application of Conductive MOF in Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have a wide range of applications in modern society as a high&#8208;performance organic material. Conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) have superior electrical conductivity compared with pristine MOFs, and thus can further improve the performance of Zn&#8208;based batteries.








Abstract
The use of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) in zinc&#8208;based batteries has been a popular research direction. Zinc&#8208;based batteries are widely used with the advantages of high specific capacity and safety and stability, but they also face many problems. c&#8208;MOFs have excellent conductivity compared with other primitive MOFs, and therefore have better applications in zinc&#8208;based batteries. In this paper, the transfer mechanisms of the unique charges of c&#8208;MOFs: hop transport and band transport, respectively, are discussed and the way of electron transport is further addressed. Then, the various ways to prepare c&#8208;MOFs are introduced, among which solvothermal, interfacial synthesis, and postprocessing methods are widely used. In addition, the applications of c&#8208;MOFs are discussed in terms of their role and performance in different types of zinc&#8208;based batteries. Finally, the current problems of c&#8208;MOFs and the prospects for their future development are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers a comprehensive understanding of the properties of proteins and their subunits, and research progress of using these versatile biomolecules to address the engineering issues of various rechargeable batteries, including alkali&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, metal&#8211;air batteries, and flow batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances and the impacts of biomolecules on electrochemical properties are particularly emphasized.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries are of great significance for alleviating the growing energy crisis by providing efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions. However, the multiple issues associated with the diverse components in a battery system as well as the interphase problems greatly hinder their applications. Proteins and their subunits, peptides, and amino acids, are versatile biomolecules. Functional groups in different amino acids endow these biomolecules with unique properties including self&#8208;assembly, ion&#8208;conducting, antioxidation, great affinity to exterior species, etc. Besides, protein and its subunit materials can not only work in solid forms but also in liquid forms when dissolved in solutions, making them more versatile to realize materials engineering via diverse approaches. In this review, it is aimed to offer a comprehensive understanding of the properties of proteins and their subunits, and research progress of using these versatile biomolecules to address the engineering issues of various rechargeable batteries, including alkali&#8208;ion batteries, lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, metal&#8211;air batteries, and flow batteries. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in electrode, electrolyte, separator, binder, catalyst, interphase modification, as well as recycling of rechargeable batteries are involved, and the impacts of biomolecules on electrochemical properties are particularly emphasized. Finally, perspectives on this interesting field are also provided.

         <title>A Functional Janus Ag Nanowires/Bacterial Cellulose Separator for High&#8208;Performance Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Anode Under Harsh Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin Janus separator composed of Ag nanowires and bacterial cellulose is designed for dendrite&#8208;free zinc&#8208;metal batteries. This Janus separator with abundant zincophilic sites, uniform&#8208;distributed electric/thermal field, and enhanced ion transport kinetics can help to realize the stable cycle life over 1000 h under 80 mA cm&#8722;2 and sustain over 600 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 under 50 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) offer promising prospects for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to their inherent abundance and safety features. However, the growth of zinc dendrites remains a primary obstacle to the practical industrialization of AZIBs, especially under harsh conditions of high current densities and elevated temperatures. To address this issue, a Janus separator with an exceptionally ultrathin thickness of 29&#160;&#181;m is developed. This Janus separator features the bacterial cellulose (BC) layer on one side and Ag nanowires/bacterial cellulose (AgNWs/BC) layer on the other side. High zincophilic property and excellent electric/thermal conductivity of AgNWs make them ideal for serving as an ion pump to accelerate Zn2+ transport in the electrolyte, resulting in greatly improved Zn2+ conductivity, deposition of homogeneous Zn nuclei, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn. Consequently, the Zn||Zn symmetrical cells with the Janus separator exhibit a stable cycle life of over 1000 h under 80&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and are sustained for over 600 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under 50 &#176;C. Further, the Janus separator enables excellent cycling stability in AZIBs, aqueous zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (AZICs), and scaled&#8208;up flexible soft&#8208;packaged batteries. This study demonstrates the potential of functional separators in promoting the application of aqueous zinc batteries, particularly under harsh conditions.

         <title>An Ultrafast Air Self&#8208;Charging Zinc Battery</title>

Abstract
Air self&#8208;charging power systems possess the capability of energy harvesting, conversion and storage simultaneously. However, in general, their self&#8208;charging rate is slow and the batteries cannot be oxidized to the fully charged state due to the weak oxidizability of O2. Herein, we designed an ultrafast air self&#8208;charging aqueous zinc battery by constructing a PANI@Pt/C composite cathode. The introduction of Pt/C catalyst endows the redox reaction between PANI and O2 with fast reaction kinetics and extended redox potential difference. Therefore, the self&#8208;charging rate of the Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries is effectively accelerated and they can be self&#8208;charged to fully charged state. Furthermore, the PANI can be recharged by O2 simultaneously during discharging process to compensate the consumed electrical energy, achieving prolonged energy supply. In addition, the PANI@Pt/C cathodes can be directly used as the cathodes of flexible self&#8208;charging zinc batteries due to their excellent mechanical properties. As a proof of concept, flexible soft&#8208;packaged Zn/PANI@Pt/C batteries were fabricated and displayed stable electrochemical performance and self&#8208;rechargeability even at different bending states. This work provides a route to design ultrafast chemical self&#8208;charging energy storage devices and broadens the horizons of flexible energy storage devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;effect Coupling for Superior Dielectric and Thermal Conductivity of Polyimide Composite Films Featuring &#8220;Crystal&#8208;like Phase&#8221; Structure</title>

Abstract
To match the increasing miniaturization and integration of electronic devices, higher requirements are put on the dielectric and thermal properties of the dielectrics to overcome the problems of delayed signal transmission and heat accumulation. Here, a 3D thermal conductivity network has been successfully constructed inside the PI matrix by the combination of ionic liquids (IL) and calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanofillers, motivated by the bubble&#8208;hole forming orientation force. Benefiting from the 3D thermal network formed by IL as a porogenic template and &#8220;crystal&#8208;like phase&#8221; structures induced by CaF2&#8208; polyamide acid charge transfer, IL&#8208;10 vol% CaF2/PI porous film exhibits a low permittivity of 2.14 and a thermal conductivity of 7.22 W&#8729;m&#8722;1&#8729;K&#8722;1. This design strategy breaks the bottleneck that low permittivity and high thermal conductivity in microelectronic systems are difficult to be jointly controlled, and provides a feasible solution for the development of intelligent microelectronics.

         <title>Micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano Oncolytic Microbial System Shifts from Tumor Killing to Tumor Draining Lymph Nodes Remolding for Enhanced Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Because the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) microenvironment is commonly immunosuppressive, oncolytic microbe&#8208;induced tumor antigens aren't sufficiently cross&#8208;primed tumor specific T cells through antigen&#8208;presenting cells (e.g., DCs) in TDLNs. Herein, we developed the micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbial therapeutics based on pyranose oxidase (P2O)&#8208;overexpressed Escherichia coli (EcP) which were simultaneously encapsulated by PEGylated mannose and low&#8208;concentrated photosensitizer nanoparticles. Following administration, P2O from this system generated toxic hydrogen peroxide for tumor regression and led to the release of tumor antigens. The &#8220;microscale&#8221; EcP was triggered, following exposure to the laser irradiation, to secret the &#8220;nanoscale&#8221; bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The enhanced TDLNs delivery via OMVs significantly regulated the TDLNs immuno&#8208;microenvironment, promoting the maturation of DCs to potentiate tumor antigen&#8208;specific T cells immune response. The micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano oncolytic microbe was leveraged to exert tumor killing and remold TDLNs for initiating potent activation of DCs, providing promising strategies to facilitate microbial cancer vaccination.

         <title>Microfluidic Platforms for Real&#8208;Time in Situ Monitoring of Biomarkers for Cellular Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cellular processes are mechanisms carried out at the cellular level (within or among more than one cell interactions) that are aimed at guaranteeing the stability of the organism they comprise. The investigation of cellular processes is key to understanding cell fate, understanding pathogenic mechanisms, and developing new therapeutic technologies. Microfluidic platforms are thought to be the most powerful tools among all methodologies for investigating cellular processes because they can integrate almost all types of the existing intracellular and extracellular biomarker&#8208;sensing methods and observation approaches for cell behavior, combined with precisely controlled cell culture, manipulation, stimulation, and analysis. Most importantly, microfluidic platforms can realize real&#8208;time in situ detection of secreted proteins, exosomes, and other biomarkers produced during cell physiological processes (adhesion, differentiation, migration, apoptosis, and cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell communication), thereby providing the possibility to draw the whole picture for a cellular process. In addition, these can be used to study the process of cell or tissue response to changes in the microenvironment (drugs, physical signals, or types and quantities of surrounding cells). Owing to their advantages of high throughput, low sample consumption, and precise cell control, microfluidic platforms with real&#8208;time in situ monitoring characteristics are widely being used in cell analysis (cellular heterogeneity analysis, cell sorting, and cellular marker detection), disease diagnosis, pharmaceutical research, and biological production. This review focuses on the basic concepts, recent progress, and application prospects of microfluidic platforms for real&#8208;time in situ monitoring of biomarkers in cellular processes.

         <title>A Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembled Biomacromolecule Film for Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Side reactions on zinc metal anodes are formidable issues that cause limited battery life of aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, we deploy a facile and controllable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly technique to construct an ion&#8208;conductive and mechanically robust electrolyte/anode interface for stabilizing the Zn anode. The LbL film consists of two natural and biodegradable biomacromolecules, chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA). We show that such an LbL film tailors the solvation sheath of Zn ions and facilitates the oriented deposition of Zn. Symmetric cells with the four double layers of CS/SA ((CS/SA)4&#8208;Zn) exhibit stable cycles for over 5200&#160;h. The (CS/SA)4&#8208;Zn||H2V3O8 coin cell maintains a specific capacity of 125.5 mAh&#8729;g&#8722;1 after 14000 cycles. The pouch cell with an electrode area of 5&#215;7 cm2 also presents a capacity retention of 83% for over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. No obvious dendrites are observed after long cycles in both symmetric and full cells. Given the cost&#8208;effective material and fabrication, and environmental friendliness of the LbL films, this Zn protection strategy may boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

         <title>Hybrid Data&#8208;Driven Discovery of High&#8208;Performance Silver Selenide&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning leveraging literature data and actively collected experimental data can speed up optimizing new AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. The approach considers five different chemical elements, and with only seven rounds of active experimentation guided by Bayesian optimization, a 75% improvement in power factor is achieved, resulting in one of the best values in this material class (2100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2).








Abstract
Optimizing material compositions often enhances thermoelectric performances. However, the large selection of possible base elements and dopants results in a vast composition design space that is too large to systematically search using solely domain knowledge. To address this challenge, a hybrid data&#8208;driven strategy that integrates Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Data is collected from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe&#8208;based materials prepared using a simple high&#8208;throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag2Se1).

     alt="Hybrid Data-Driven Discovery of High-Performance Silver Selenide-Based Thermoelectric Composites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning leveraging literature data and actively collected experimental data can speed up optimizing new AgSe-based thermoelectric materials. The approach considers five different chemical elements, and with only seven rounds of active experimentation guided by Bayesian optimization, a 75% improvement in power factor is achieved, resulting in one of the best values in this material class (2100 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimizing material compositions often enhances thermoelectric performances. However, the large selection of possible base elements and dopants results in a vast composition design space that is too large to systematically search using solely domain knowledge. To address this challenge, a hybrid data-driven strategy that integrates Bayesian optimization (BO) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) is proposed to optimize the composition of five elements (Ag, Se, S, Cu, and Te) in AgSe-based thermoelectric materials. Data is collected from the literature to provide prior knowledge for the initial GPR model, which is updated by actively collected experimental data during the iteration between BO and experiments. Within seven iterations, the optimized AgSe-based materials prepared using a simple high-throughput ink mixing and blade coating method deliver a high power factor of 2100 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which is a 75% improvement from the baseline composite (nominal composition of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The success of this study provides opportunities to generalize the demonstrated active machine learning technique to accelerate the development and optimization of a wide range of material systems with reduced experimental trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators Based on Fluid Medium: From Fundamental Mechanisms toward Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fluid&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (FB&#8208;TENGs) are at the forefront of promising energy technologies, demonstrating the ability to generate electricity through the dynamic interaction between two dissimilar materials, wherein at least one is a fluidic medium (such as gas or liquid). By capitalizing on the dynamic and continuous properties of fluids and their interface interactions, FB&#8208;TENGs exhibit a larger effective contact area and a longer&#8208;lasting triboelectric effect in comparison to their solid&#8208;based counterparts, thereby affording longer&#8208;term energy harvesting and higher&#8208;precision self&#8208;powered sensors in harsh conditions. In this review, various fluid&#8208;based mechanical energy harvesters, including liquid&#8208;solid, gas&#8208;solid, liquid&#8208;liquid and gas&#8208;liquid TENGs, have been systematically summarized. Their working mechanism, optimization strategies, respective advantages and applications, theoretical and simulation analysis, as well as the existing challenges, have also been comprehensively discussed, which provide prospective directions for device design and mechanism understanding of FB&#8208;TENGs.

Abstract
Piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric materials are considered unique biomedical materials due to their dielectric crystals and asymmetric centers that allow them to directly convert various primary forms of energy in the environment, such as sunlight, mechanical energy, and thermal energy, into secondary energy, such as electricity and chemical energy. These materials possess exceptional energy conversion ability and excellent catalytic properties, which have led to their widespread usage within biomedical fields. Numerous biomedical applications have demonstrated great potential with these materials, including disease treatment, biosensors, and tissue engineering. For example, piezoelectric materials have been used to stimulate cell growth in bone regeneration, while pyroelectric materials have been applied in skin cancer detection and imaging. Ferroelectric materials have even found use in neural implants that record and stimulate electrical activity in the brain. This paper reviews the relationship between ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and pyroelectric effects and the fundamental principles of different catalytic reactions. It also highlights the preparation methods of these three materials and the significant progress made in their biomedical applications. The review concludes by presenting key challenges and future prospects for efficient catalysts based on piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric nanomaterials for biomedical applications.

         <title>Flexible Electrodes for Brain&#8211;Computer Interface System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The brain projects around the world, the classification of electrical neural signals, the applications of brain&#8211;computer interface, drawbacks of rigid electrodes, and the necessity to switch to flexible electrodes, are briefly introduced in this article. Then the classification of different type of electrodes, electrode materials, fabrication methods, flexible substrates, and extra requirements for flexible electrodes have been systematically reviewed.








Abstract
Brain&#8211;computer interface (BCI) has been the subject of extensive research recently. Governments and companies have substantially invested in relevant research and applications. The restoration of communication and motor function, the treatment of psychological disorders, gaming, and other daily and therapeutic applications all benefit from BCI. The electrodes hold the key to the essential, fundamental BCI precondition of electrical brain activity detection and delivery. However, the traditional rigid electrodes are limited due to their mismatch in Young's modulus, potential damages to the human body, and a decline in signal quality with time. These factors make the development of flexible electrodes vital and urgent. Flexible electrodes made of soft materials have grown in popularity in recent years as an alternative to conventional rigid electrodes because they offer greater conformance, the potential for higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR)&#160;signals, and a wider range of applications. Therefore, the latest classifications and future developmental directions of fabricating these flexible electrodes are explored in this paper to further encourage the speedy advent of flexible electrodes for BCI. In summary, the perspectives and future outlook for this developing discipline are provided.

         <title>Berry Curvature Dipole Induced Giant Mid&#8208;Infrared Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in 2D Weyl Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant mid&#8208;infrared second&#8208;harmonic generation performance (better than the visible region) is demonstrated in the newly discovered Weyl semiconductor &#8722;2D Te. Theoretical calculations reveal that it originated from the large Berry curvature dipole near the Weyl points of 2D Te. Therefore, even excited by continuous&#8208;wave laser, strong sum&#8208;frequency generation can be obtained in 2D Te.








Abstract
Due to its inversion&#8208;broken triple helix structure and the nature of Weyl semiconductor, 2D Tellurene (2D Te) is promising to possess a strong nonlinear optical response in the infrared region, which is rarely reported in 2D materials. Here, a giant nonlinear infrared response induced by large Berry curvature dipole (BCD) is demonstrated in the Weyl semiconductor 2D Te. Ultrahigh second&#8208;harmonic generation response is acquired from 2D Te with a large second&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibility (&#967;(2)), which is up to 23.3 times higher than that of monolayer MoS2 in the range of 700&#8211;1500&#160;nm. Notably, distinct from other 2D nonlinear semiconductors, &#967;(2) of 2D Te increases extraordinarily with increasing wavelength and reaches up to 5.58&#160;nm&#160;V&#8722;1 at &#8776;2300&#160;nm, which is the best infrared performance among the reported 2D nonlinear materials. Large &#967;(2) of 2D Te also enables the high&#8208;intensity sum&#8208;frequency generation with an ultralow continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pump power. Theoretical calculations reveal that the exceptional performance is attributed to the presence of large BCD located at the Weyl points of 2D Te. These results unravel a new linkage between Weyl semiconductor and strong optical nonlinear responses, rendering 2D Te a competitive candidate for highly efficient nonlinear 2D semiconductors in the infrared region.

         <title>Bulk&#8208;Switching Memristor&#8208;Based Compute&#8208;In&#8208;Memory Module for Deep Neural Network Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory module integrated with bulk&#8208;switching memristor arrays is demonstrated. A hardware&#8211;software co&#8208;designed system is constructed to accelerate the neural network training and relax stringent requirements for device precision and endurance. The on&#8208;chip trained networks are able to reach software&#8208;comparable accuracies and exhibit robustness to weight perturbation when transferred to a new chip.








Abstract
The constant drive to achieve higher performance in deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to the proliferation of very large models. Model training, however, requires intensive computation time and energy. Memristor&#8208;based compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) modules can perform vector&#8208;matrix multiplication (VMM) in place and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications. However, CIM&#8208;based model training faces challenges due to non&#8208;linear weight updates, device variations, and low&#8208;precision. In this work, a mixed&#8208;precision training scheme is experimentally implemented to mitigate these effects using a bulk&#8208;switching memristor&#8208;based CIM module. Low&#8208;precision CIM modules are used to accelerate the expensive VMM operations, with high&#8208;precision weight updates accumulated in digital units. Memristor devices are only changed when the accumulated weight update value exceeds a pre&#8208;defined threshold. The proposed scheme is implemented with a system&#8208;onchip of fully integrated analog CIM modules and digital sub&#8208;systems, showing fast convergence of LeNet training to 97.73%. The efficacy of training larger models is evaluated using realistic hardware parameters and verifies that CIM modules can enable efficient mix&#8208;precision DNN training with accuracy comparable to full&#8208;precision software&#8208;trained models. Additionally, models trained on chip are inherently robust to hardware variations, allowing direct mapping to CIM inference chips without additional re&#8208;training.

Memristor-based compute-in-memory (CIM) modules can perform vector-matrix multiplication (VMM) in place and in parallel, and have shown great promises in DNN inference applications. However, CIM-based model training faces challenges due to non-linear weight updates, device variations, and low-precision. In this work, a mixed-precision training scheme is experimentally implemented to mitigate these effects using a bulk-switching memristor-based CIM module. Low-precision CIM modules are used to accelerate the expensive VMM operations, with high-precision weight updates accumulated in digital units. Memristor devices are only changed when the accumulated weight update value exceeds a pre-defined threshold. The proposed scheme is implemented with a system-onchip of fully integrated analog CIM modules and digital sub-systems, showing fast convergence of LeNet training to 97.73%. The efficacy of training larger models is evaluated using realistic hardware parameters and verifies that CIM modules can enable efficient mix-precision DNN training with accuracy comparable to full-precision software-trained models. Additionally, models trained on chip are inherently robust to hardware variations, allowing direct mapping to CIM inference chips without additional re-training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activatable Prodrug Nanosystem for Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Multimodal Tumor Therapy and Metastasis Inhibition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dihydroethidium (DHE)&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem (DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE) is introduced for ultrasound&#8208;driven tumor therapy. Under medical ultrasound, it produces cytotoxic ethidium and reactive oxygen species. DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE induces ferroptosis via glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and glutathione peroxidase 4 reduction. Furthermore, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE NPs not only exhibits effective ultrasound&#8208;active therapy of solid tumors but also downregulate the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins, inhibiting lung metastasis.








Abstract
Ultrasound, featuring deep tissue penetration and noninvasiveness, offers a new opportunity to activate functional materials in a tumor&#8208;selective manner. However, very few direct ultrasound&#8208;responsive redox systems are applicable under therapeutic ultrasound (1&#160;MHz). Herein, the investigations on nanoprodrug of DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE are reported, which exhibit glutathione&#8208;activated release of dihydroethidium (DHE) in tumor cells. DHE is stable with good biosafety and is transformed into cytotoxic ethidium to induce DNA damage under medical ultrasound irradiation, accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Further, DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE could effectively induce ferroptosis through glutathione depletion, lipid peroxide accumulation, and downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. In vivo studies confirmed that DHE@PEG&#8208;SS&#8208;DSPE nanoparticles effectively inhibit both the growth of solid tumors and the expression of metastasis&#8208;related proteins in mice, thus effectively inhibiting lung metastasis. This DHE&#8208;based prodrug nanosystem could lay a foundation for the design of ultrasound&#8208;driven therapeutic agents.

         <title>Light&#8208;Based 3D Printing of Complex&#8208;Shaped Photonic Colloidal Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photonic colloidal glasses with isotropic structural color can be shaped into complex objects by light&#8208;based 3D printing and calcination. Printed and calcined parts rely on sustainable, non&#8208;bleaching colloidal particles for color formation, making them an attractive alternative to traditional pigments in applications such as security features, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Colloidal glasses display angle&#8208;independent structural color that is tunable by the size and local arrangement of sub&#8208;micrometer particles. While films, droplets, and microcapsules with isotropic structural color have been demonstrated, the shaping of colloidal glasses in three dimensions remains an open manufacturing challenge. Here, a light&#8208;based printing platform for the shaping of colloidal glasses into 3D objects featuring complex geometries and vivid structural color after thermal treatment is reported. Rheology, photopolymerization, and calcination experiments are performed to design the photoreactive resins leading to printable colloidal glasses. With the help of microscopy, scattering, and optical characterization, it is shown that the photonic properties of the printed objects reflect the locally ordered microstructure of the glass. The capability of the platform in creating 3D objects with isotropic structural color is illustrated by printing lattices and miniaturized sculpture replicas with unique shapes and multimaterial designs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Bright Heptamethine Dye Clusters Based on a Self&#8208;Adaptive Co&#8208;Assembly Strategy for NIR&#8208;IIb Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy, FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence which enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with ultra&#8208;high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can also occur in situ between IPA&#8208;FlavP2000/FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD).








Abstract
Despite the wide range of applications of bright NIR&#8208;II polymethine scaffolds in biomedical imaging, their solvatochromism and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects in aqueous solutions limit their inherent brightness using traditional encapsulation methods, and effective hydrophilization strategies are still scarce. Here, a new set of Flav dyes is synthesized and PEGylated, followed by manufacturing DSPE@FlavP2000 nanoparticles using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy to overcome these limitations. FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence (&#8776;44.9% fluorescence of Flav in DMSO). DSPE@FlavP2000 enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can occur in situ between FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD), achieving consistent brightness as DSPE@FlavP2000 in blood or serum. The self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy can be enhanced by incorporating an IPA moiety, which dynamically binds to albumin to prolong the dye's blood circulation time. Thus, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; BAD is successfully applied to long&#8208;term vascular imaging and sciatic nerve imaging. Both the self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy and BAD phenomenon improve the selectivity and availability of the hydrophilization methods, paving the way for efficient biological applications of polymethine dyes.

         <title>A Multiscale, Dynamic Elucidation of Li Solubility in the Alloy and Metallic Plating Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying rationales that govern the rate&#8208;determining Li+ mass&#8208;transfer kinetics are comprehensively investigated across multiple scales, from the bulk solution, the faradic reaction at the interface to the solid&#8208;state diffusion. This study provides insights of thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetics competitive processes, which facilitates innovation of the high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.









Abstract
Li&#8208;containing alloys and metallic deposits offer substantial Li+ storage capacities as alternative anodes to commercial graphite. However, the thermodynamically in sequence, yet kinetically competitive mechanism between Li solubility in the solid solution and intermediate alloy&#8208;induced Li deposition remains debated, particularly across the multiple scales. The elucidation of the mechanism is rather challenging due to the dynamic alloy evolution upon the non&#8208;equilibrium, transient lithiation processes under coupled physical fields. Here, influential factors governing Li solubility in the Li&#8208;Zn alloy are comprehensively investigated as a demonstrative model, spanning from the bulk electrolyte solution to the ion diffusion within the electrode. Through real&#8208;time phase tracking and spatial distribution analysis of intermediate alloy/Li metallic species at varied temperatures, current densities and particle sizes, the driving force of Li solubility and metallic plating along the Li migration pathway are probed in&#8208;depth. This study investigates the correlation between kinetics (pronounced concentration polarization, miscibility gap in lattice grains) and rate&#8208;limiting interfacial charge transfer thermodynamics in dedicating the Li diffusion into the solid solution. Additionally, the lithiophilic alloy sites with the balanced diffusion barrier and Li adsorption energy are explored to favor the homogeneous metal plating, which provides new insights for the rational innovation of high&#8208;capacity alloy/metallic anodes.

         <title>Flexible Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Epitaxially Grown Nanocrystals for Micro&#8208;Thermoelectric Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an unconventional heteroepitaxial growth strategy to prepare high&#8208;performance flexible and freestanding thermoelectric film with ordered and uniform microstructures. The integrated micro&#8208;thermoelectric module based on the above films exhibits excellent energy harvesting and cooling performance, validating the potential of freestanding thermoelectric films for thermal energy efficient harvesting and management.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal management.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flexible thermoelectric materials have attracted increasing interest because of their potential use in thermal energy harvesting and high-spatial-resolution thermal management. However, a high-performance flexible micro-thermoelectric device (TED) compatible with the microelectronics fabrication process has not yet been developed. Here a universal epitaxial growth strategy is reported guided by 1D van der Waals-coupling, to fabricate freestanding and flexible hybrids comprised of single-wall carbon nanotubes and ordered (Bi,Sb)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals. High power factors ranging from &#8776;1680 to &#8776;1020 &#181;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the temperature range of 300&#8211;480 K, combined with a low thermal conductivity yield a high average figure of merit of &#8776;0.81.

         <title>Spatial Position Regulation of Cu Single Atom Site Realizes Efficient Nanozyme Photocatalytic Bactericidal Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes in the interlayer and in&#8208;plane of PHI are synthesized through different synthesis pathways. Compared with the Cu atoms located within the PHI plane, the interlayer position of PHI is more conducive to photoelectron migration and O2 adsorption and activation, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics.








Abstract
Recently, single&#8208;atom nanozymes have made significant progress in the fields of sterilization and treatment, but their catalytic performance as substitutes for natural enzymes and drugs is far from satisfactory. Here, a method is reported to improve enzyme activity by adjusting the spatial position of a single&#8208;atom site on the nanoplatforms. Two types of Cu single&#8208;atom site nanozymes are synthesized in the interlayer (CuL/PHI) and in&#8208;plane (CuP/PHI) of poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) through different synthesis pathways. Experimental and theoretical analysis indicates that the interlayer position of PHI can effectively adjust the coordination number, coordination bond length, and electronic structure of Cu single atoms compared to the in&#8208;plane position, thereby promoting photoinduced electron migration and O2 activation, enabling effective generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under visible light irradiation, the photocatalytic bactericidal activity of CuL/PHI against aureus is &#8776;100%, achieving the same antibacterial effect as antibiotics, after 10&#160;min of low&#8208;dose light exposure and 2&#160;h of incubation.

         <title>Spatially Controlled UV Light Generation at Depth using Upconversion Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
UV light can trigger diverse photochemical reactions, yet it is extremely challenging to deliver these high&#8208;energy photons beyond the surface. Triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to tackle this issue. To demonstrate precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are deployed to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter deep within an aqueous solution.








Abstract
UV light can trigger a plethora of useful photochemical reactions for diverse applications, including photocatalysis, photopolymerization, and drug delivery. These applications typically require penetration of high&#8208;energy photons deep into materials, yet delivering these photons beyond the surface is extremely challenging due to absorption and scattering effects. Triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) shows great promise to circumvent this issue by generating high&#8208;energy photons from incident lower&#8208;energy photons. However, molecules that facilitate TTA&#8208;UC usually have poor water solubility, limiting their deployment in aqueous environments. To address this challenge, a nanoencapsulation method is leveraged to fabricate water&#8208;compatible UC micelles, enabling on&#8208;demand UV photon generation deep into materials. Two iridium&#8208;based complexes are presented for use as TTA&#8208;UC sensitizers with increased solubilities that facilitate the formation of highly emissive UV&#8208;upconverting micelles. Furthermore, this encapsulation method is shown to be generalizable to nineteen UV&#8208;emitting UC systems, accessing a range of upconverted UV emission profiles with wavelengths as low as 350&#160;nm. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle demonstration of precision photochemistry at depth, UV&#8208;emitting UC micelles are used to photolyze a fluorophore at a focal point nearly a centimeter beyond the surface, revealing opportunities for spatially controlled manipulation deep into UV&#8208;responsive materials.

         <title>Permittivity&#8208;Based Microparticle Classification by the Integration of Impedance Cytometry and Microwave Resonators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material classification is achieved by measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles through a novel sensing platform that combines impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. Polystyrene and soda&#8208;lime glass microparticles are successfully classified, while differentiating between healthy and fixed cells. This paves the way for targeted applications in environmental monitoring and pharmaceutical quality control.








Abstract
Permittivity of microscopic particles can be used as a classification parameter for applications in materials and environmental sciences. However, directly measuring the permittivity of individual microparticles has proven to be challenging due to the convoluting effect of particle size on capacitive signals. To overcome this challenge, a sensing platform is built to independently obtain both the geometric and electric size of a particle, by combining impedance cytometry and microwave resonant sensing in a microfluidic chip. This way the microwave signal, which contains both permittivity and size effects, can be normalized by the size information provided by impedance cytometry to yield an intensive parameter that depends only on permittivity. The technique allows to differentiate between polystyrene and soda lime glass microparticles&#8212;below 22&#160;&#181;m in diameter&#8212;with more than 94% accuracy, despite their similar sizes and electrical characteristics. Furthermore, it is shown that the same technique can be used to differentiate between normal healthy cells and fixed cells of the same geometric size. The technique offers a potential route for targeted applications such as environmental monitoring of microplastic pollution or quality control in pharmaceutical industry.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable, Excitation&#8208;Dependent, and Water Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Cellulose for Versatile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined with the advantages of conventional conjugated aromatic luminescence and macromolecular cluster luminescence, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction. The resulting transparent films exhibit color&#8208;tunable, excitation&#8208;dependent, and water stimulus&#8208;response afterglows, giving an impressive room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms.








Abstract
Smart&#8208;response materials with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desirable, but they have rarely been described, especially those originating from sustainable polymers. Herein, a variety of cellulose derivatives with 1,4&#8208;dihydropyridine (DHP) rings are synthesized through the Hantzsch reaction, giving impressive RTP with a long lifetime of up to 1251&#160;ms. Specifically, the introduction of acetoacetyl groups and DHP rings promotes the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and intersystem crossing process; and multiple interactions between cellulose induce clustering and inhibit the nonradiative transitions, boosting long&#8208;live RTP. Furthermore, the resulting transparent and flexible cellulose films also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependent and color&#8208;tunable afterglows by introducing different extended aromatic groups. More interestingly, the RTP performance of these films is sensitive to water and can be repeated in response to wet/dry stimuli. Inspired by these advantages, the RTP cellulose demonstrates advanced applications in information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work not only enriches the photophysical properties of cellulose but also provides a versatile platform for the development of sustainable afterglows.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general synthetic strategy for fabricating single&#8208;layer hollow structures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with high 1T&#8208;phase purity is developed by selectively etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures. The obtained single&#8208;layer hollow structure of 1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits excellent electrochemical activity and durable stability in hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Rational design and controllable synthesis of hollow structures based on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have gained tremendous attention in the field of clean energy. However, the general synthetic strategies to fabricate single&#8208;layer hollow structures of TMDs, especially with unconventional phases (e.g., 1T or 1T&#8242;), still pose significant challenges. Herein, a scalable method is reported for the synthesis of single&#8208;layer hollow spheres (SLHS) of TMDs with high 1T&#8208;phase purity by etching bismuth (Bi) cores from pre&#8208;synthesized Bi@TMDs core&#8211;shell heterostructures including SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoSe2, SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WS2, and SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;WSe2. Additionally, the etched Bi ions can be adsorbed on the single&#8208;layer TMDs shells in the form of single atoms (SAs) via the Bi&#9472;S bond. Due to the benefits of the single&#8208;layer hollow structure, high conductivity of 1T phase, and synergistic effect of Bi SAs and TMDs supports, the fabricated SLHS&#8208;1T&#8208;MoS2 exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen production. This work provides a way to manufacture advanced functional materials based on the single&#8208;layer hollow structures of 1T&#8208;TMDs and to expand their applications.

The organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction platform helps prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) with ultrahigh drug&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) that can be used for personalized anticancer therapy. According to the platform, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with a DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for medium&#8208;sized and large ovarian tumors. Moreover, aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for colon tumors.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;drug conjugates (ADCs) have exciting possibilities in targeted tumor therapy. However, in the existing ADC preparation processes, the random attachment of the payloads to the antigen&#8208;binding fragments (Fab) greatly increases the risk of disrupting its antigen recognition ability, while the drug&#8208;antibody ratio&#160;(DAR) is low, leading to a cumbersome preparation process and low drug delivery efficiency. Herein, poly(glutamic acid) is used to expand the number of drug binding sites, based on the &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; of azide and DBCO, and the high affinity of Fc&#8208;III&#8208;4C peptide to the crystalline fragment (Fc) of the monoclonal antibodies. Various antibody&#8208;polymer&#8208;drug conjugates are obtained with ultrahigh DAR using this organic&#8208;solvent&#8208;free &#8220;Lego&#8208;like&#8221; modular construction. Among them, aHER2&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE with DAR of 41.6 achieves tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 99.7% for both medium&#8208;sized and large SKOV&#8208;3 ovarian tumors, and aPDL1&#8208;P&#8208;MMAE (DAR = 40.7) achieves TGI of 98.5% for MC38 colon tumors. In summary, a universal platform is created to prepare Fab&#8208;nondestructive ADCs with ultrahigh DAR, which can be used to develop precision medicine for personalized anticancer therapy.

         <title>Modulating the Active Hydrogen Adsorption on Fe&#9472;N Interface for Boosted Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction with Ultra&#8208;Long Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Fe&#8211;N interface is designed to ameliorate the utilization of active hydrogen for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction to suppress the occurrence of hydrogen evolution reaction. In addition, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC harvests superb stability due to the dual reinforcement of the internal Fe2N and the external carbon layer. This catalyst exhibits trade&#8208;offs between the scale&#8208;up application and the nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to nitrogen (N2) is an environmentally friendly approach for efficient N&#8208;cycle management (toward a nitrogen&#8208;neutral cycle). However, poor catalyst durability and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly impede its practical application. Interface&#8208;chemistry engineering, utilizing the close relationship between the catalyst surface/interface microenvironment and electron/proton transfer process, has facilitated the development of catalysts with high intrinsic activity and physicochemical durability. This study reports the synthesis of a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated rice&#8208;like iron nitride (RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC) electrocatalyst with excellent electrocatalytic nitrate&#8208;reduction reaction activity (high N2 selectivity (&#8776;96%) and NO3&#8722; conversion (&#8776;86%)). According to detailed mechanistic investigations by in situ tests and theoretical calculations, the strong hydrogenation ability of iron nitride and enhanced nitrate enrichment of the system synergistically contribute to the rapid hydrogenation of nitrogen&#8208;containing species, increasing the intrinsic activity of the catalyst and reducing the occurrence of the competing hydrogen&#8208;evolution side reaction. Moreover, RL&#8208;Fe2N@NC shows excellent stability, retaining good NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;N2 electrocatalysis activity for more than 40 cycles (one cycle per day). This paper could guide the interfacial design of Fe&#8208;based composite nanostructures for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction, facilitating a shift toward nitrogen neutrality.

         <title>Water Activation in Solar&#8208;Powered Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive understanding on theoretical analyses about vaporization enthalpy, general calculation, and characterization means related to solar&#8208;powered water evaporation and the mechanisms of water activation to reduce the enthalpy are outlined. Furthermore, the typical representative and milestone works in solar&#8208;powered vapor generation are summarized, aiming to provide a relatively complete development chain and introduce a faster insight into this direction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;powered vapor evaporation (SVG), based on the liquid&#8208;gas phase conversion concept using solar energy, has been given close attention as a promising technology to address the global water shortage. At molecular level, water molecules escaping from liquid water should overcome the attraction of the molecules on the liquid surface layer to evaporate. For this reason, it is better to reduce the energy required for evaporation by breaking a smaller number of hydrogen bonds or forming weak hydrogen bonds to ensure efficient and convenient vapor production. Many novel evaporator materials and effective water activation strategies have been proposed to stimulate rapid steam production and surpass the theoretical thermal limit. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the phase/enthalpy change process of water evaporation is unclear. In this review, a summary of theoretical analyses of vaporization enthalpy, general calculations, and characterization methods is provided. Various water activation mechanisms are also outlined to reduce evaporation enthalpy in evaporators. Moreover, unsolved issues associated with water activation are critically discussed to provide a direction for future research. Meanwhile, significant pioneering developments made in SVG are highlighted, hoping to provide a relatively entire chain for more scholars who are just stepping into this field.

         <title>Outer Membrane Vesicle&#8208;Based Nanohybrids Target Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages to Enhance Trained Immunity&#8208;Related Vaccine&#8208;Generated Antitumor Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) nanohybrids, as a trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine (TIrV), induce central and peripheral trained immunity that can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring and enhance trained immunity&#8208;related vaccine&#8208;generated antitumor activity. This TIrV&#160;targets tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) and induces different antitumor mechanisms with or without CD8 T cell activation in two distinct tumor models.








Abstract
Trained immunity refers to the innate immune system building memory&#8208;like features in response to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Compared with classical tumor vaccines, trained immunity&#8208;related vaccines (TIrV) are independent of tumor&#8208;specific antigens. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV&#8208;inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long&#8208;term training, and trained tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, an OMV&#8208;based TIrV is developed, OMV nanohybrids (OMV&#8208;SIRP&#945;@CaP/GM&#8208;CSF) for exerting vaccine&#8208;enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM&#8208;CSF&#8208;assisted OMVs train bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which are inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP&#945;&#8208;Fc&#8208;assisted OMVs trigger TAM&#8208;mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase&#8208;accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV&#8208;mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM&#8208;hot and T cell&#8208;cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16&#8208;F10 tumor model (T cell&#8208;hot and TAM&#8208;cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. This study not only develops and identifies OMV&#8208;based TIrV, but also investigates the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.

&lt;p&gt;Outer membrane vesicle (OMV) nanohybrids, as a trained immunity-related vaccine (TIrV), induce central and peripheral trained immunity that can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring and enhance trained immunity-related vaccine-generated antitumor activity. This TIrV&#160;targets tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and induces different antitumor mechanisms with or without CD8 T cell activation in two distinct tumor models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trained immunity refers to the innate immune system building memory-like features in response to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Compared with classical tumor vaccines, trained immunity-related vaccines (TIrV) are independent of tumor-specific antigens. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV-inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long-term training, and trained tumor-associated macrophage (TAM)-mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, an OMV-based TIrV is developed, OMV nanohybrids (OMV-SIRP&#945;@CaP/GM-CSF) for exerting vaccine-enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM-CSF-assisted OMVs train bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which are inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP&#945;-Fc-assisted OMVs trigger TAM-mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, it is found that the TIrV-mediated antitumor mechanism in the MC38 tumor model (TAM-hot and T cell-cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in the B16-F10 tumor model (T cell-hot and TAM-cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. This study not only develops and identifies OMV-based TIrV, but also investigates the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cooperative Rheological State&#8208;Switching of Enzymatically&#8208;Driven Composites of Circular DNA And Dextran</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. Time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. Bulk state&#8208;switching is shown to arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses.








Abstract
Polymer topology, which plays a principal role in the rheology of polymeric fluids, and non&#8208;equilibrium materials, which exhibit time&#8208;varying rheological properties, are topics of intense investigation. Here, composites of circular DNA and dextran are pushed out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium via enzymatic digestion of DNA rings to linear fragments. These time&#8208;resolved rheology measurements reveal discrete state&#8208;switching, with composites undergoing abrupt transitions between dissipative and elastic&#8208;like states. The gating time and lifetime of the elastic&#8208;like states, and the magnitude and sharpness of the transitions, are surprisingly decorrelated from digestion rates and non&#8208;monotonically depend on the DNA fraction. These results are modeled using sigmoidal two&#8208;state functions to show that bulk state&#8208;switching can arise from continuous molecular&#8208;level activity due to the necessity for cooperative percolation of entanglements to support macroscopic stresses. This platform, coupling the tunability of topological composites with the power of enzymatic reactions, may be leveraged for diverse material applications from wound&#8208;healing to self&#8208;repairing infrastructure.

         <title>Diels&#8211;Alder Photoclick Patterning of Extracellular Matrix for Spatially Controlled Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radical&#8208;free, Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based photopatterning platform is presented which enables the spatially defined modification of protein&#8208;based hydrogels with dienophile&#8208;bearing biomolecules. By utilizing commercially available maleimide&#8208;functionalized streptavidin and biotinylated species of interest, a robust mix&#8208;and&#8208;match platform is demonstrated. Through the immobilization of biotinylated growth factors, the use of these engineered substrates to program cell behaviors is highlighted.








Abstract
Strategies that mimic the spatial complexity of natural tissues can provide cellular scaffolds to probe fundamental questions in cell biology and offer new materials for regenerative medicine. Here, the authors demonstrate a light&#8208;guided patterning platform that uses natural engineered extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins as a substrate to program cellular behaviors. A photocaged diene which undergoes Diels&#8211;Alder&#8208;based click chemistry upon uncaging with 365&#160;nm light is utilized. By interfacing with commercially available maleimide dienophiles, patterning of common ECM proteins (collagen, fibronectin Matrigel, laminin) with readily purchased functional small molecules and growth factors is achieved. Finally, the use of this platform to spatially control ERK activity and migration in mammalian cells is highlighted, demonstrating programmable cell behavior through patterned chemical modification of natural ECM.

         <title>Esterase&#8208;Labile Quaternium Lipidoid Enabling Improved mRNA&#8208;LNP Stability and Spleen&#8208;Selective mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipidoids is constructed with the aim to develop new AMB&#8208;POC18 lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for robust messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection exclusively in the spleen. The AMB&#8208;POC18 LNPs encapsulating tumor antigen mRNA can effectively transfect antigen&#8208;presenting cells, induce the proliferation of effector T cells, and exhibit potent therapeutic and prophylactic efficacy against melanoma without side effects.









Abstract
Ionizable cationic lipids are recognized as an essential component of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery but can be confounded by low lipoplex stability with mRNA during storage and in vivo delivery. Herein, the rational design and combinatorial synthesis of esterase&#8208;triggered decationizable quaternium lipid&#8208;like molecules (lipidoids) are reported to develop new LNPs with high delivery efficiency and improved storage stability. This top lipidoid carries positive charges at the physiological condition but promptly acquires negative charges in the presence of esterase, thus permitting stable mRNA encapsulation during storage and in vivo delivery while balancing efficient mRNA release in the cytosol. An optimal LNP formulation is then identified through orthogonal optimization, which enables efficacious mRNA transfection selectively in the spleen following intravenous administration. LNP&#8208;mediated delivery of ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;encoding mRNA induces efficient antigen expression in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicits robust antigen&#8208;specific immune responses against OVA&#8208;transduced tumors. The work demonstrates the potential of decationizable quaternium lipidoids for spleen&#8208;selective RNA transfection and cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Enantioselective Oral Absorption of Molecular Chiral Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by the unique pharmacological effects of chiral drugs in the asymmetrical body environments, we assumed the chirality of nanocarriers was also a key factor to determine their oral adsorption efficiency, apart from their size, shape, etc. Herein, we fabricated L/D&#8208;tartaric acid modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (L/D&#8208;CMSNs) via a one&#8208;pot co&#8208;condensation method, and focused on whether the oral adsorption of nanocarriers would be benefited from their chirality. We found that L&#8208;CMSN performed better in the sequential oral absorption processes, including mucus permeation, mucosa bio&#8208;adhesion, cellular uptake, intestinal transport and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) retention, than those of the D&#8208;chiral (D&#8208;CMSN), racemic (DL&#8208;CMSN), and achiral (MSN) counterparts. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrated the multiple chiral recognition mechanisms following simple differential adsorption on bio&#8208;interfaces, wherein electrostatic interaction was the dominant energy. During the oral delivery task, L&#8208;CMSN, which was proven to be stable, nonirritative, biocompatible and biodegradable, was efficiently absorbed into the blood (1.72&#8211;2.05&#8208;fold higher than other nanocarriers), and helped the loaded doxorubicin (DOX) to achieve better intestinal transport (2.32&#8211;27.03&#8208;times higher than other samples), satisfactory bioavailability (449.73%) and stronger anti&#8208;tumor effect (up to 95.43%). These findings validated the dominant role of chirality in determining the biological fate of nanocarriers.

         <title>Synergetic Sn Incorporation&#8208;Zn Substitution in Copper&#8208;Based Sulfides Enabling Superior Na&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high&#8208;energy Na&#8208;ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation&#8208;Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper&#8208;based sulfides. First, the Na&#8208;ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy&#8208;based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied with the sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na&#8208;ion uptake. Subsequently, to maintain the high Na&#8208;ion storage capacity, and concurrently improve the cycling and rate capabilities, a Zn substitution strategy (taking partial Sn sites) is carried out, which could significantly promote the Na&#8208;ion diffusion/reaction kinetics and relieve the mechanical strain&#8208;stress within the crystal framework. The synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution endow the copper&#8208;based sulfides with high specific capacity (&#8764;560 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1), ultrastable cyclability (80 k cycles with &#8764;100% capacity retention), superior rate capability up to 200 A g&#8722;1, and ultrafast charging feature (&#8764;4 s per charging with &#8764;190 mAh g&#8722;1 input). This work provides in&#8208;depth insights for developing superior anode materials via synergetic multi&#8208;cation incorporation/substitution, aiming at solving their intrinsic issues of either low specific capacity or poor cyclability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal sulfides have been regarded as perspective anode candidates for high-energy Na-ion batteries. Their application, however, is precluded severely by either low charge storage or huge volumetric change along with sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, an effective synergetic Sn incorporation-Zn substitution strategy is proposed based on copper-based sulfides. First, the Na-ion storage capability of copper sulfide is significantly improved via incorporating an alloy-based Sn element. However, this process is accompanied with the sacrifice of structural stability due to the high Na-ion uptake. Subsequently, to maintain the high Na-ion storage capacity, and concurrently improve the cycling and rate capabilities, a Zn substitution strategy (taking partial Sn sites) is carried out, which could significantly promote the Na-ion diffusion/reaction kinetics and relieve the mechanical strain-stress within the crystal framework. The synergetic Sn incorporation and Zn substitution endow the copper-based sulfides with high specific capacity (&#8764;560 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ultrastable cyclability (80 k cycles with &#8764;100% capacity retention), superior rate capability up to 200 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ultrafast charging feature (&#8764;4 s per charging with &#8764;190 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; input). This work provides in-depth insights for developing superior anode materials via synergetic multi-cation incorporation/substitution, aiming at solving their intrinsic issues of either low specific capacity or poor cyclability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Revealing The Deposition Mechanism of The Powder Aerosol Deposition Method Using Ceramic Oxide Core&#8208;Shell Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Powder Aerosol Deposition method (PAD) is a process to manufacture ceramic films completely at room temperature. Since the first reports by Akedo in the late 1990s, much research has been conducted to reveal the exact mechanism of the deposition process. However, it is still not fully understood. We tackled this challenge using core shell particles. Two coated oxides, Al2O3 core with a SiO2 shell and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 core with a LiNbO3 shell, were investigated. Initially, the element ratios Al:Si and Ni:Nb of the powder were determined by EDX. In a second step, the change in the element ratios of Al:Si and Ni:Nb after deposition were investigated. The element ratios from powder to film strongly shift towards the shell&#8208;elements, indicating that the particles fracture and only the outer parts of the particles are deposited. In the last step, we investigated cross&#8208;sections of the deposited films with STEM combined with EDX and an EsB detector to unveil the element distribution within the film itself. Therefore, the following overall picture emerges: particles impact on the substrate or on previously deposited particle, fracture, and only a small part of the impacting particles that originate from the outer part of the impacting particle gets deposited.

         <title>Simultaneous Catalytic Acceleration of White Phosphorus Polymerization And Red Phosphorus Potassiation for High&#8208;Performance Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Red phosphorus (P) as an anode material of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) possesses ultra&#8208;high theoretical specific capacity (1154 mAh g&#8722;1). However, owing to residual white P during the preparation and sluggish kinetics of K&#8208;P alloying limit its practical application. Seeking an efficient catalyst to address above problems is crucial for secure preparation of red P anode with high performance. Herein, through the analysis of the activation energies in white P polymerization, it is revealed that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy of I2 (&#8208;7.40&#160;eV) is in proximity to P4 (&#8208;7.25&#160;eV), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy of I2 molecule (&#8208;4.20&#160;eV) is lower than that of other common non&#8208;metallic molecules (N2, S8, Se8, F2, Cl2, Br2). The introduction of I2 can thus promote the breaking of P&#8208;P bond and accelerate the polymerization of white P molecules. Besides, the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations show the I2 can enhance the kinetics of P&#8208;K alloying. The as&#8208;obtained red P/C composites with I2 deliver excellent cycling stability (358 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1200 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). This study establishes catalysis as a promising pathway to tackle the challenges of P anode for alkali metal ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Red phosphorus (P) as an anode material of potassium-ion batteries (KIBs) possesses ultra-high theoretical specific capacity (1154 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, owing to residual white P during the preparation and sluggish kinetics of K-P alloying limit its practical application.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Efficiency And Operational&#8208;Stability of Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells via Interfacial Toughening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We have investigated the combined effects of compact TiO2 (c&#8208;TiO2) electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) without and with mesoscopic TiO2 (m&#8208;TiO2) on top, and without and with an iodine&#8208;terminated silane self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), on the mechanical behavior, opto&#8208;electronic properties, photovoltaic (PV) performance, and operational&#8208;stability of solar cells based on metal&#8208;halide perovskites (MHPs). The interfacial toughness increases almost three&#8208;fold in going from c&#8208;TiO2 without SAM to m&#8208;TiO2 with SAM. This is attributed to the synergistic effect of the m&#8208;TiO2/MHP nanocomposite at the interface and the enhanced adhesion afforded by the iodine&#8208;terminated silane SAM. The combination of m&#8208;TiO2 and SAM also offers a significant beneficial effect on the photocarriers extraction at the ETL/MHP interface, resulting in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 24% and 20% for 0.1 cm2 and 1 cm2 active areas, respectively. These PSCs also have exceptionally long operational&#8208;stability lives: extrapolated T80 (duration at 80% initial PCE retained) is about 18,000&#160;h and 10,000&#160;h for 0.1 cm2 for 1 cm2 active areas, respectively. Postmortem characterization and analyses of the operational&#8208;stability&#8208;tested PSCs were performed to elucidate the possible mechanisms responsible for the long operational&#8208;stability.

         <title>Achieving Desired Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells via Binary&#8208;Dilution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The sequential deposition process has demonstrated the great possibility to achieve a photolayer architecture with an ideal gradient phase separation morphology, which has a vital influence on the physical processes that determine the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the controllable preparation of pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (P&#8208;PHJ) with gradient distribution has not been effectively elucidated. Herein, we have proposed a binary&#8208;dilution strategy, the PM6 solution with micro acceptor BO&#8208;4Cl and the L8&#8208;BO solution with micro donor PM6 respectively, to form P&#8208;PHJ film. This architecture exists good donor (D) and acceptor (A) vertical gradient distribution and larger D/A interpenetrating regions, which promotes exciton generation and dissociation, shortens charge transport distance and optimizes carrier dynamics. Moreover, the dilution of PM6 by BO&#8208;4Cl promotes the regulation of active layer aggregation size and phase purity, thus alleviating energy disorder and voltage loss. As a result, the P&#8208;PHJ device exhibits an outstanding power conversion efficiency of 19.32% with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.92&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, much higher than planar binary heterojunction (17.67%) and ternary bulk heterojunction (18.49%) devices. This research proves a simple but effective method to provide an avenue for constructing desirable active layer morphology and high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>The Lotus Effect Inspired Hydrophobic Strategy for Stable Zn Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H2O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)&#8208;modified Cu@Zn (SA&#8208;Cu@Zn) anode as example, we herein illustrate how the lotus effect controls the H2O adsorption energy on Zn metal anode. The in&#8208;situ integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long&#8208;chain alkyl groups have been constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode exhibits long&#8208;term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, which has improved the electrochemical performance of Zn||V2O5 full cell. DFT calculations combined with water contact angle measurements demonstrated that the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn exhibits larger water contact angle and weaker H2O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA&#8208;Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how excellent reversibility has been achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H2O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIBs anode.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) have long suffered from the unstable Zn metal anode, which faces numerous challenges concerning dendrite growth, corrosion and hydrogen evolution reaction. The absence of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption control techniques has become a bottleneck for the further development of ZIBs. Using the stearic acid (SA)-modified Cu@Zn (SA-Cu@Zn) anode as example, we herein illustrate how the lotus effect controls the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption energy on Zn metal anode. The &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; integrated Cu nanorods arrays and hydrophobic long-chain alkyl groups have been constructed, which provide zincophilic ordered channels and hydrophobic property. Consequently, the SA-Cu@Zn anode exhibits long-term cycling stability over 2000&#160;h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.83% at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which has improved the electrochemical performance of Zn||V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; full cell. DFT calculations combined with water contact angle measurements demonstrated that the SA-Cu@Zn exhibits larger water contact angle and weaker H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption than Zn. Moreover, the presence of Cu ensures the selective adsorption of Zn on the SA-Cu@Zn anode, well explaining how excellent reversibility has been achieved. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of the lotus effect on controllable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O adsorption and Zn deposition mechanism, offering a universal strategy for achieving stable ZIBs anode.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lanthanide Three&#8208;Dimensional Supramolecular Framework Boosts Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with High Uv Utilization</title>

Abstract
In this work, the ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transition and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process is exploited to derive lanthanide organic framework (Tb&#8208;cpon) modified perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with enhanced performance under UV irradiation. Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;modified PSCs exhibit rapid response and reduced degradation due to energy down&#8208;conversion facilitated by effective coupling of UV&#8208;sensitive chromophores to lanthanide luminescent centers, enhancing the spectral response range of the composite films. Furthermore, the characteristic changes of precursor particle sizes suggest formation of Tb&#8208;cpon adducts as intermediate products, leading to enhanced crystallinity and reduced defect concentrations in the Tb&#8208;cpon&#8208;perovskite hybrid film. Accordingly, the Tb&#8208;cpon modified PSC devices obtained a champion efficiency up to 23.72% as well as a sensitive photovoltaic conversion even under pure UV irradiation. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained more than 80% of the initial efficiency after continuous irradiation under a 310&#160;nm UV lamp for 24&#160;h (from the Au electrode side), compared to 21% for the control devices.

         <title>Universal Stripe Symmetry of Short&#8208;range Charge Density Waves in Cuprate Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The omnipresence of charge density waves (CDWs) across almost all cuprate families underpins a common organizing principle. However, a longstanding debate of whether its spatial symmetry is stripe or checkerboard remains unresolved. While CDWs in lanthanum&#8208; and yttrium&#8208;based cuprates possess a stripe symmetry, distinguishing these two scenarios has been challenging for the short&#8208;range CDW in bismuth&#8208;based cuprates. Here, we&#160; employed high&#8208;resolution resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering to uncover the spatial symmetry of the CDW in Bi2$_2$Sr2&#8722;x$_{2-x}$Lax$_{x}$CuO6+&#948;$_{6+\delta }$. Across a wide range of doping and temperature, anisotropic CDW peaks with elliptical shapes were&#160; found in reciprocal space. Based on Fourier transform analysis of real&#8208;space models, we&#160; interpret the results as evidence of unidirectional charge stripes, hosted by mutually 90&#8728;$^\circ$&#8208;rotated anisotropic domains. Our&#160; work paves the way for a unified symmetry and microscopic description of CDW order in&#160;cuprates.

         <title>Crystallization Control Based on The Regulation of Solvent&#8208;Perovskite Coordination for High&#8208;performance Ambient Printable FAPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The critical requirement for ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 lies in the control of nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics and defect formation behavior, which are extensively influenced by interactions between the solvent and perovskite. In this study, a strategy has been developed that combines a cosolvent and an additive to efficiently tailor the coordination between the solvent and perovskite. Through in&#8208;situ characterizations, we illustrate the direct crystallization from the sol&#8211;gel phase to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. When the solvent exhibits strong interactions with the perovskite, the sol&#8211;gel phases cannot effectively transform into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, resulting in a lower nucleation rate and confined crystal growth directions. Consequently, it becomes challenging to fabricate high&#8208;quality void&#8208;free perovskite films. Conversely, weaker solvent&#8211;perovskite coordination promotes direct crystallization from sol&#8211;gel phases to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. This process exhibits more balanced nucleation&#8208;growth kinetics and restrains the formation of defects and microstrains in situ. This strategy leads to improved structural and optoelectronic properties within the FAPbI3 films, characterized by more compact grain stacking, smoother surface morphology, released lattice strain, and fewer defects. The ambient&#8208;printed FAPbI3 PSCs fabricated using this strategy exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 24%, with significantly reduced efficiency deviation and negligible decreases in the stabilized output.

Abstract
The latest developments in fiber design and materials science are paving the way for fibers to evolve from parts in passive components to functional parts in active fabrics. Designing conformable, organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) structures using poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) fibers has excellent potential for low&#8208;cost wearable bioelectronics, bio&#8208;hybrid devices and adaptive neuromorphic technologies. However, realizing this potential requires developing approaches to form good electrodes, on small fiber diameters with poor wettability and irregular coatings, to achieve high&#8208;performance and good stability devices. Additionally, PEDOT:PSS&#8208;fiber fabrication needs to move away from small batch processing to roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll or continuous processing. Here, we show that synergistic effects from a superior electrode/organic interface, and exceptional fiber alignment from continuous processing, enable PEDOT:PSS fiber&#8208;OECTs with stable contacts, high &#956;C* product (1570.5 F/cmVs), and high hole mobility over 45 cm2/Vs. We developed fiber&#8208;electrochemical neuromorphic organic devices (fiber&#8208;ENODes) to demonstrate that the high mobility fibers are promising building blocks for future bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. The fiber&#8208;ENODes have synaptic weight update in response to dopamine, as well as a form factor closely matching the neuronal axon terminal.

         <title>Revealing the Mutually Enhanced Mechanism of Necroptosis and Immunotherapy Induced by Defect Engineering and Piezoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to low immunogenicity&#8208;induced immune escape and short&#8208;term circulating immune responses, the efficiency of immunotherapy is unsatisfactory. Therefore, triggering immunogenic cell death and establishing a long&#8208;term, mutually reinforced treatment modality are urgent challenges. In this study, ultrathin CaBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets with tunable oxygen vacancies (abbreviated as CBNO&#8208;OV1) are prepared for synergistic necroptosis and immunotherapy. The optimized vacancy concentration significantly improves the piezoelectric effect under ultrasound irradiation, thereby considerably improving the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Density functional theory shows that oxygen vacancies can improve the efficiency of electron hole separation by suppressing their recombination, thus resulting in enhanced piezocatalytic activity. Moreover, the piezoelectric effect improves the permeability of tumor cell membranes, thus resulting in Ca2+ influx. Additionally, CBNO&#8208;OV1 also releases a portion of Ca2+, which induces necroptosis assisted by explosive ROS. Ribonucleic Acid transcription tests suggest the mechanisms associated with immune response activation and necroptosis. More importantly, necroptosis can trigger a significant immune response in vivo, thus activating macrophage M1 polarization through the NF&#8208;&#954;B pathway and promoting T&#8208;cell differentiation. TNF&#8208;&#945; differentiated from macrophages conversely promotes necroptosis, thus realizing a mutually enhanced effect. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of mutually reinforced necroptosis and immunotherapy for amplifying tumor efficacy.

         <title>Highly Efficient And Stable ITO&#8208;free Organic Solar Cells Based on Squaraine N&#8208;Doped Quaternary Bulk Heterojunction</title>

Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high efficiency and robust device stability remains a significant challenge for organic solar cells (OSCs). Solving this challenge is highly dependent on the film morphology of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive blends; however, there is a lack of rational control strategy. Herein, we show that the molecular crystallinity and nanomorphology of nonfullerene&#8208;based BHJ can be effectively controlled by a squaraine&#8208;based doping strategy, leading to an increase in device efficiency from 17.26% to 18.5% when doping 2&#160;wt.% squaraine into the PBDB&#8208;TF:BTP&#8208;eC9:PC71BM ternary BHJ. The efficiency is further improved to 19.11% (certified 19.06%) using an ITO&#8208;free column&#8208;patterned microcavity (CPM) architecture. Combined with interfacial modification, CPM quaternary OSC excitingly shows an extrapolated lifetime of &#8764;23 years based on accelerated aging test, with the mechanism behind enhanced stability well studied. Furthermore, a flexible OSC module with a high and stable efficiency of 15.2% and an overall area of 5 cm2 has been successfully fabricated, exhibiting a high average output power for wearable electronics. Our work demonstrates OSCs with new design of BHJ and device architecture are highly promising to be practical relevance with excellent performance and stability.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;driven Non&#8208;metallic Fenton&#8208;active Center Construction for Extensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is an emerging tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive cancer therapeutic strategy based on Fenton/Fenton&#8208;like reactions. However, the effectiveness of CDT is subject to the slow kinetic rate and non&#8208;homogeneous distribution of H2O2. In this study, a conceptual non&#8208;metallic &#8220;Fenton&#8208;active&#8221; center construction strategy is proposed to enhance CDT efficiency using Bi0.44Ba0.06Na0.5TiO3 (BNBT&#8208;6) nanocrystals. The separated charge carriers under a piezoelectric&#8208;induced electric field synchronize the oxidation of H2O and reduction of H2O2, which consequently increases hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) yield even under low H2O2 levels. Moreover, acceptor doping induces electron&#8208;rich oxygen vacancies to facilitate the dissociation of H2O2 and H2O and further promote &#183;OH generation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that BNBT&#8208;6 induces extensive intracellular oxidative stress and enhances cell&#8208;killing efficiency by activating necroptosis in addition to the conventional apoptotic pathway. This study proposes a novel design approach for nanomaterials used in CDT and presents a new treatment strategy for apoptosis&#8208;resistant tumors.

         <title>A &#8220;Trinity&#8221; Design of Li&#8208;O2 Battery Engaging the Slow&#8208;Release Capsule of Redox Mediators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nonaqueous Li&#8208;O2 battery (LOB) represents one of the promising next&#8208;gen energy storage solutions owing to its ultrahigh energy density but suffers from problems such as high charging overpotential, slow redox kinetics and Li anode corrosion etc., calling for a systemic optimization of the battery configuration and structural components. Herein, an ingenious &#8220;trinity&#8221; design of LOB is initiated by implementing a hollowed cobalt metal organic framework (MOF) impregnating iodized polypyrrole simultaneously as the cathode catalyst, anode protection layer and slow&#8208;release capsule of redox mediators, so as to systemically address issues of impeded mass transport and redox kinetics on the cathode, dendrite growth and surface corrosion on the anode, as well as limited intermediate solubility in the low donor&#8208;number (DN) solvent. As a result of the systemic effort, the LOB constructed demonstrates an ultralow discharge/charge polarization of 0.2&#160;V, prolonged cycle life of 1200&#160;h and total discharge capacity of 28.41 mAh cm&#8722;2. Mechanistic investigations attribute the superb LOB performance to the redox&#8208;mediated solution growth mechanism of crystalline Li2O2 with both enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility. This study offers a paradigm in designing smart materials to raise the performance bar of Li&#8208;O2 battery towards realistic applications.

Abstract
Air electrode is an essential component of air&#8208;demanding energy storage/conversion devices, such as zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) and hydrogen fuel cells (HFCs), which determines the output power and stability of the devices. Despite atom&#8208;level modulation in catalyst design being recently achieved, the following air electrodes have received much less attention, causing a stagnation in the development of air&#8208;demanding equipment. This Progress Report begins with the evolution of air electrodes for ZABs and HFCs from the early stages to current requirements. Then, the operation mechanism and the corresponding electrocatalytic mechanisms of ZABs are summarized. In particular, by clarifying the air electrode interfaces of ZABs at different scales, several approaches to improve the air electrode in rechargeable ZABs are reviewed, including the innovative electrode structures and bifunctional oxygen catalysts. Afterwards, we explain the operating mechanisms of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). Subsequently, the strategies employed to enhance the efficiency of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFCs and AEMFCs, respectively, are highlighted and discussed in detail. Last, the prospects for air electrodes in ZABs and HFCs are considered by discussing the main challenges. This Progress Report aims to facilitate the industrialization of ZABs and HFCs.

         <title>Intrinsic Polarised Electric Field Induces A Storing Mechanism to Achieve Energy Storing Catalysis in V2c MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient storage and separation of holes and electrons pose significant challenges for catalytic reactions, particularly in the context of single&#8208;phase catalysis. Herein, V2C MXene, with its intrinsic polarized electric field, successfully overcomes this obstacle. To enhance hole storage, a multi&#8208;step etching process is employed under reducing conditions to control the content of surface termination groups, thus exposing more defective active sites. The intrinsically polarized electric field confines holes to the surface of the layer and free electrons within the layer, leading to a lag in e&#8208; release compared to h+. The quantities of stored holes and electrons were measured to be 18.13 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1 and 106.37 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1, respectively. Under dark, V2C demonstrates excellent and stable dark&#8208;catalytic performance, degrading 57.91% of tetracycline (TC 40&#160;mg/L) and removing 23% of organic carbon (TOC) after 140 minutes. In simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light, the corresponding degradation rates reached 72.24% and 79.54%, with corresponding TOC removal rates of 49% and 48%, respectively. The hole and electron induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effects contribute to a long&#8208;lasting and enhanced broad&#8208;spectrum mineralization of V2C MXene. This study provides valuable insights into the research and application of all&#8208;weather MXene energy storage catalytic materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Amorphous Silicon Carbide for Nanomechanics</title>

Abstract
For decades, mechanical resonators with high sensitivity have been realized using thin&#8208;film materials under high tensile loads. Although there have been remarkable strides in achieving low&#8208;dissipation mechanical sensors by utilizing high tensile stress, the performance of even the best strategy is limited by the tensile fracture strength of the resonator materials. In this study, a wafer&#8208;scale amorphous thin film is uncovered, which has the highest ultimate tensile strength ever measured for a nanostructured amorphous material. This silicon carbide (SiC) material exhibits an ultimate tensile strength of over 10 GPa, reaching the regime reserved for strong crystalline materials and approaching levels experimentally shown in graphene nanoribbons. Amorphous SiC strings with high aspect ratios are fabricated, with mechanical modes exceeding quality factors 108 at room temperature, the highest value achieved among SiC resonators. These performances are demonstrated faithfully after characterizing the mechanical properties of the thin film using the resonance behaviors of free&#8208;standing resonators. This robust thin&#8208;film material has significant potential for applications in nanomechanical sensors, solar cells, biological applications, space exploration and other areas requiring strength and stability in dynamic environments. The findings of this study open up new possibilities for the use of amorphous thin&#8208;film materials in high&#8208;performance&#160;applications.

         <title>Exploring the Synergies of Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence and 2D Materials Coupled by DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating single&#8208;molecule (SM) fluorescence methods with 2D materials by using DNA and related nanostructures as molecular anchors provides significant benefits for both fields: deepening knowledge about the materials while adding information to SM fluorescence experiments. This Perspective delves into the rich interplay, highlights new opportunities for further synergies, and identifies challenges in this cross&#8208;disciplinary venture.








Abstract
The world of 2D materials is steadily growing, with numerous researchers attempting to discover, elucidate, and exploit their properties. Approaches relying on the detection of single fluorescent molecules offer a set of advantages, for instance, high sensitivity and specificity, that allow the drawing of conclusions with unprecedented precision. Herein, it is argued how the study of 2D materials benefits from fluorescence&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule modalities, and vice versa. A special focus is placed on DNA, serving as a versatile adaptor when anchoring single dye molecules to 2D materials. The existing literature on the fruitful combination of the two fields is reviewed, and an outlook on the additional synergies that can be created between them provided.

         <title>Tailor&#8208;Made White Photothermal Fabrics: A Bridge between Pragmatism and Aesthetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A white composite fabric with an exceptional photo&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion capability that outperforms ordinary black photothermal fabric is developed. Collective characteristics of shape retention, softness, breathability, light weight, fast&#8208;drying, durability, and tailorability into diverse appearances are integrated into this novel fabric, which promises to satisfy the needs of future advanced garment manufacturing, thermoregulation, and aesthetics.








Abstract
Maintaining human thermal comfort in the cold outdoors is crucial for diverse outdoor activities, e.g., sports and recreation, healthcare, and special occupations. To date, advanced clothes are employed to collect solar energy as a heat source to stand cold climates, while their dull dark photothermal coating may hinder pragmatism in outdoor environments&#160;and visual sense considering fashion. Herein, tailor&#8208;made white webs with strong photothermal effect are proposed. With the embedding of cesium&#8211;tungsten bronze (CsxWO3) nanoparticles (NPs) as additive inside nylon nanofibers, these webs are capable of drawing both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight for heating. Their exceptional photothermal conversion capability enables 2.5&#8211;10.5 &#176;C greater warmth than that of a commercial sweatshirt of six times greater thickness under different climates. Remarkably, this smart fabric can increase its photothermal conversion efficiency in a wet state. It is optimal for fast sweat or water evaporation at human comfort temperature (38.5 &#176;C) under sunlight, and its role in thermoregulation is equally important to avoid excess heat loss in wilderness survival. Obviously, this smart web with considerable merits of shape retention, softness, safety, breathability, washability, and on&#8208;demand coloration provides a revolutionary solution to realize energy&#8208;saving outdoor thermoregulation and simultaneously satisfy the needs of fashion and aesthetics.

         <title>Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scaffold&#8208;based platform to increase the throughput, reproducibility, and geometric control of 3D organoids is presented. Melt electrowriting is used to generate fibrous scaffolds that guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into a large array of suspended interconnected or discrete organoids. Tuning the geometry of the scaffold enables to control the shape and lumen formation of the emerging tissues.








Abstract
3D organoids are widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low&#8208;throughput culture methods, coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity, restrict the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, melt electrospinning writing is used to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. Grid geometry is shown to be a key determinant of stem cell self&#8208;organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature&#8208;controlled tissue growth. Two distinct methods for culturing scaffold&#8208;grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids are reported. These scaffolds provide a high&#8208;throughput method to generate, culture, and analyze large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labor involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. It is anticipated that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high&#8208;throughput screening.

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic tetra&#8208;carboxyphenyl&#8208;substituted cobalt phthalocyanine is designed to adjust the hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of CoPc/carbon hybrid materials from a molecular perspective. The catalyst maintains effective contact between the active sites and the electrolyte, and achieves efficient CO2RR in both H&#8208;type cell and MEA device with exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability, and structural tunability of the macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). In this work, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to reveal the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. Surprisingly, the resultant electrode exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95% for CO2RR with turnover frequency (TOF) of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in a H&#8208;type cell. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, the boosted transport of water vapor to the catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode, with FECO value of &gt;99% over 27 h at &#8722;0.25 A, representing the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from a molecular perspective.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Frameworks of High Piezovoltage for Sono&#8208;Piezo Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectric Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework (MT&#8208;MOF) of high piezovoltage is designed for new sono&#8208;piezoelectric dynamic therapy with significant antitumor efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, the MT&#8208;MOF, which has a piezopotential of 2.9&#160;V, exciting charges under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, not only causes ROS overproduction but also disrupts the polarization of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes inducing intense cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials produce charges to directly act on cancer medium or promote the generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) for novel tumor therapy triggered by sonography. Currently, piezoelectric sonosensitizers are mainly used to catalyze ROS generation by the band&#8208;tilting effect for sonodynamic therapy. However, it remains a challenge for piezoelectric sonosensitizers to produce high piezovoltages to overcome the bandgap barrier for direct charge generation. Herein, Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework tetragonal nanosheets (MT&#8208;MOF TNS) are designed to produce high piezovoltages for novel sono&#8208;piezo (SP)&#8208;dynamic therapy (SPDT) with remarkable antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS comprise non&#8208;centrosymmetric secondary building units of Mn&#8211;Ti&#8211;oxo cyclic octamers with charge heterogeneous components for piezoelectricity. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS promotes strong sonocavitation to induce piezoelectric effect with a high SP voltage (2.9&#160;V) in situ, to directly excite charges, which is validated by SP&#8208;excited luminescence spectrometry. The SP voltage and charges depolarize the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials and cause ROS overproduction and serious tumor cell damage. Importantly, MT&#8208;MOF TNS can be decorated with targeting molecules and chemotherapeutics for more severe tumor regression by combining SPDT with chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. This report develops a fascinating MT&#8208;MOF piezoelectric nano&#8208;semiconductor and provides an efficient SPDT strategy for tumor treatment.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in 2D Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental evidence of the nearly independent single topological flat band (FB) generated by the 2D Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layer&#160;in Nb3TeCl7 with identical on&#8208;site energy of Nb sites is reported. The possibility of modulating the bandwidth, energy position, and topology of the FB by altering the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites in the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome frustrated geometry is disclosed.








Abstract
Flat bands&#160;(FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an aveanue to manipulate FB characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;Derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semicrystalline, mechanochromic stereoelastomers possessing spiropyran mechanophores are synthesized via thiol&#8208;yne Michael addition polymerization. Tensile tests across two decades of strain rates reveal significant correlations between strain hardening, strain&#8208;induced crystallization, and mechanochromism, which exhibits a novel multiregime behavior. Spiropyran recovery kinetics after failure are controlled by strain&#8208;induced crystallization, resulting in record activation lifetimes.








Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8211;0.38&#160;mol%) are reported. The material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP is a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Mechanophore reversion kinetics correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently crosslinked, they are recyclable by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, increasing their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here, a strategy is reported to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane elastomer by phototriggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. A trifunctional molecular motor modified with an ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light&#8208;responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Molecular Structure and Conformational Design of Donor&#8208;Acceptor Conjugated Polymers to Enable Predictable Optoelectronic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing integrated experimental and computational methods, it is demonstrated that alterations in the chain conformation of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers do not consistently exhibit a direct correlation with shifts in optical absorption. Moreover, it is revealed that the combined effect of chain conformation and the alignment of molecular orbital energy between donor and acceptor units influence the ultimate optical bandgap of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers.








Abstract
Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor&#8208;acceptor conjugated polymers (D&#8208;A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices. However, there remains a critical challenge in precise control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, D&#8208;A CPs with different acceptor units are explored that show an opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy, it is found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D&#8208;A CPs. For polymers with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for polymers with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding of the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D&#8208;A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.

&lt;p&gt;By employing integrated experimental and computational methods, it is demonstrated that alterations in the chain conformation of donor-acceptor conjugated polymers do not consistently exhibit a direct correlation with shifts in optical absorption. Moreover, it is revealed that the combined effect of chain conformation and the alignment of molecular orbital energy between donor and acceptor units influence the ultimate optical bandgap of donor-acceptor conjugated polymers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuning the optoelectronic properties of donor-acceptor conjugated polymers (D-A CPs) is of great importance in designing various organic optoelectronic devices. However, there remains a critical challenge in precise control of bandgap through synthetic approach, since the chain conformation also affects molecular orbital energy levels. Here, D-A CPs with different acceptor units are explored that show an opposite trend in energy band gaps with the increasing length of oligothiophene donor units. By investigating their chain conformation and molecular orbital energy, it is found that the molecular orbital energy alignment between donor and acceptor units plays a crucial role in dictating the final optical bandgap of D-A CPs. For polymers with staggered orbital energy alignment, the higher HOMO with increasing oligothiophene length leads to a narrowing of the optical bandgap despite decreased chain rigidity. On the other hand, for polymers with sandwiched orbital energy alignment, the increased band gap with increasing oligothiophene length originates from the reduction of bandwidth due to more localized charge density distribution. Thus, this work provides a molecular understanding of the role of backbone building blocks on the chain conformation and bandgaps of D-A CPs for organic optoelectronic devices through the conformation design and segment orbital energy alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming Water Diffusion Limitations in Hydrogels via Microtubular Graphene Networks for Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates bioinspired microstructured thermoresponsive hydrogels for soft actuators with enhanced actuation performance and options for both light&#8208; and electrically controlled actuation. The poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels contain interconnected microtubular graphene networks for enhanced water transport, resulting in increased actuation dynamics and stresses without compromising the softness and mechanical stability of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of up to &#8776;90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense skin layer. Here it is shown, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4% dramatically enhances actuation dynamics by up to &#8776;400% and actuation stress by &#8776;4000% without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light&#8208;controlled and electrically powered actuation. It is anticipated that the concept provides a versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining responsive and 2D materials, paving the way toward designing soft intelligent matter.

         <title>A Bioinspired Bilevel Metamaterial for Multispectral Manipulation toward Visible, Multi&#8208;Wavelength Detection Lasers and Mid&#8208;Infrared Selective Radiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation with visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared selective absorption for camouflage, motivated by the butterfly scales with broadband reflection splitting effect. This work not only widens the working wavebands compared to the conventional materials but also opens a bioinspired way to improve the multispectral performance of wave&#8208;functional metamaterials.








Abstract
Manipulation of the electromagnetic signature in multiple wavebands is necessary and effective in civil and industrial applications. However, the integration of multispectral requirements, particularly for the bands with comparable wavelengths, challenges the design and fabrication of current compatible metamaterials. Here, a bioinspired bilevel metamaterial is proposed for multispectral manipulation involving visible, multi&#8208;wavelength detection lasers and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR), along with radiative cooling. The metamaterial, consisting of dual&#8208;deck Pt disks and a SiO2 intermediate layer, is inspired by the broadband reflection splitting effect found in butterfly scales and achieves ultralow specular reflectance (average of 0.013) over the entire 0.8&#8211;1.6&#160;&#181;m with large scattering angles. Meanwhile, tunable visible reflection and selective dual absorption peaks in MIR can be simultaneously realized, providing structural color, effective radiative thermal dissipation at 5&#8211;8&#160;&#181;m and 10.6&#160;&#181;m laser absorption. The metamaterial is fabricated by a low&#8208;cost colloidal lithography method combined with two patterning processes. Multispectral manipulation performances are experimentally demonstrated and a significant apparent temperature drop (maximum of 15.7&#160;&#176;C) compared to the reference is observed under a thermal imager. This work achieves optical response in multiple wavebands and provides a valuable way to effectively design multifunctional metamaterials inspired by nature.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxides&#8208;Based Memristor: Outstanding Resistive Switching Performance and Mechanisms in Atomic Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive random&#8208;access memory based on high&#8208;entropy oxide exhibits excellent performance, such as low power consumption, long retention time, and excellent endurance. The excellent properties are due to the interactions among the five metal cations and the entropy stabilization effect. The switching behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt.








Abstract
The application of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique structural characteristics, such as excellent electrochemical properties and long&#8208;term cycling stability. However, the application of resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) has not been extensively studied, and the switching mechanism of HEO&#8208;based RRAM has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, HEO (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)3O4 with a spinel structure is epitaxially grown on a Nb:STO conductive substrate, and Pt metal is deposited as the top electrode. After the resistive&#8208;switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure are transformed into a rock&#8208;salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. From the results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive&#8208;switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 105, outstanding endurance (&gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&gt;104 s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillation of Thermoplasmonic Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oscillation is the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus. A new self&#8208;oscillator model is presented in which photoactive plasmonic nanoparticles display periodic clustering under non&#8208;periodic illumination. The surface temperature of nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at infrasonic/acoustic frequencies. Further mathematical extension of the model suggests the emergence of a thermoplasmonic attractor.








Abstract
Self&#8208;oscillation&#8212;the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus&#8212;is vital for creating low&#8208;maintenance autonomous devices in soft robotics technologies. Soft composites of macroscopic dimensions are often doped with plasmonic nanoparticles to enhance energy dissipation and generate periodic response. However, while it is still unknown whether a dispersion of photonic nanocrystals may respond to light as a soft actuator, a dynamic analysis of nanocolloids self&#8208;oscillating in a liquid is also lacking. This study presents a new self&#8208;oscillator model for illuminated colloidal systems. It predicts that the surface temperature of thermoplasmonic nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at frequencies ranging from infrasonic to acoustic values. New experiments with spontaneously clustering gold nanorods, where the photothermal effect alters the interplay of light (stimulus) with the disperse system on a macroscopic scale, strongly support the&#160;theory. These findings enlarge the current view on self&#8208;oscillation phenomena and anticipate the colloidal state of matter to be a suitable host for accommodating light&#8208;propelled machineries. In broad terms, a complex system behavior is observed, which goes from periodic solutions (Hopf&#8211;Poincar&#233;&#8211;Andronov bifurcation) to a new dynamic attractor driven by nanoparticle interactions, linking thermoplasmonics to nonlinearity and&#160;chaos.

         <title>Effective Modulation of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress for Enhanced Regeneration of Intervertebral Discs Using 3D Porous Hybrid Protein Nanoscaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Effective modulation of inflammation requires sustainable and dynamic blockades of diverse inflammatory mediators. A 3D porous hybrid protein nanoscaffold&#8208;based therapeutic strategy is developed to inhibit pro&#8208;inflammatory reactive oxygen species, cf nucleic acids, and regulate epigenetics in immune cells. This strategy robustly suppresses inflammation in vivo, promotes tissue regeneration, and reduces pain signaling after intervertebral disc injuries.








Abstract
Degeneration of fibrocartilaginous tissues is often associated with complex pro&#8208;inflammatory factors. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell&#8208;free nucleic acids (cf&#8208;NAs), and epigenetic changes in immune cells. To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanoscaffold&#8208;based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D&#8208;PHP) self&#8208;therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial&#8208;templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release, disc&#8208;mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme&#8208;like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf&#8208;NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D&#8208;PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long&#8208;term pain reduction. Therefore, self&#8208;therapeutic and epigenetic modulator&#8208;encapsulated hybrid protein nanoscaffold shows great promise as a novel approach to restore dysregulated inflammatory signaling and treat degenerative fibrocartilaginous diseases, including disc injuries, providing hope and relief to patients worldwide.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Synthesis of Sodium Chlorides of Unconventional Stoichiometries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis yield of 2D Na2Cl crystals with unconventional stoichiometries in a graphene membrane can be significantly improved by applying a negative potential. Such high content can substantially improve the physical performance of the abnormal Na2Cl crystals. These findings represent a step toward the potential applications of abnormal 2D crystal materials with unique properties.








Abstract
Abnormal salt crystals with unconventional stoichiometries, such as Na2Cl, Na3Cl, K2Cl, and CaCl crystals that have been explored in reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) or diamond anvil cells, hold great promise in applications due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties predicted in theory. However, the low content of these crystals, only &lt;1% in rGOM, limits their research interest and utility in applications. Here, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of 2D abnormal crystals with unconventional stoichiometries is reported, which is achieved by applying negative potential on rGOM. A more than tenfold increase in the abnormal Na2Cl crystals is obtained using a potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V, resulting in an atomic content of 13.4&#160;&#177;&#160;4.7% for Na on rGOM. Direct observations by transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrates a unique piezoelectric behavior arising from 2D Na2Cl crystals with square structure. The output voltage increases from 0 to &#8776;180&#160;mV in the broad 0&#8211;150&#176; bending angle regime, which meets the voltage requirement of most nanodevices in realistic applications. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the applied negative potential of the graphene surface can strengthen the effect of the Na+&#8211;&#960; interaction and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between cations, making more Na2Cl crystals formed.

         <title>A Nano&#8208;Biohybrid&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Solar Cell to Regulate the Electrical Signal Transmission to Living Cells for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell capable of absorbing a broad range of visible wavelengths and generating an amplified photocurrent density is developed to verify the possibility of its biomedical application. The electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction are regulated precisely by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell upon light irradiation.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;solar cells are studied as sustainable and biocompatible energy sources with significant potential for biomedical applications. However, they are composed of light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules with narrow absorption wavelengths and weak transient photocurrent generation. In this study, a nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell composed of bacteriorhodopsin, chlorophyllin, and Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles is developed to overcome the current limitations and verify the possibility of biomedical applications. Bacteriorhodopsin and chlorophyllin are introduced as light&#8208;harvesting biomolecules to broaden the absorption wavelength. As a photocatalyst, Ni/TiO2 nanoparticles are introduced to generate a photocurrent and amplify the photocurrent generated by the biomolecules. The developed bio&#8208;solar cell absorbs a broad range of visible wavelengths and generates an amplified stationary photocurrent density (152.6&#160;nA&#160;cm&#8722;2) with a long lifetime (up to 1&#160;month). Besides, the electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions are precisely regulated by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell, indicating that the bio&#8208;solar cell can control living cells by signal transmission through other types of living cells. The proposed nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell can be used as a sustainable and biocompatible energy source for the development of wearable and implantable biodevices and bioelectronic medicines for humans.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#9472;C Bonds achieving Long Cycle Life of an Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling effect of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds increases the reaction energy barrier and restrains the irreversible structure reconstruction from FeOOH to &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3, endowing an Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C electrode with the coexistence of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycle stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure are developed, and they exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase can be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24&#160;000 cycles). An ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38&#160;000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1.

         <title>Engineering and Characterization of an Artificial Drug&#8208;Carrying Vesicles Nanoplatform for Enhanced Specifically Targeted Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>

ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are constructed via a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, can carry Doxorubicin (DOX) to penetrate blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and target inflamed brain tumors. It can improve the anticancer efficacy of DOX, significantly reducing side effects. Meanwhile, this work indicates that the nanoplatform may offer great promise for targeted glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) chemotherapy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment is hindered by complex pathologies and the need to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) during drug delivery. Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are&#160;constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, is developed. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep&#8208;2 fused to the N&#8208;terminus of TRP&#8208;PK1, to present Angiopep&#8208;2 on the EAVs. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have efficient BBB&#8208;penetration and GBM&#8208;targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo. Doxorubicin loading EAVs (ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@DOX) do not alter the characteristics of the EAVs, which can cross the BBB, reach the GBM, and kill tumor cells in orthotopic GBM mouse models. These engineered drug&#8208;loaded artificial vesicles show better therapeutic effects on GBM than temozolomide in mice, with very few side effects. In conclusion, EAVs can be inserted into different targeting ligands and packed into different drugs, and they may serve as unique and efficient nanoplatforms for drug delivery and tumor promise therapy.

         <title>Photothermal&#8211;Magnetic Synergistic Effects in an Electrocatalyst for Efficient Water Splitting under Optical&#8211;Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the corresponding optical and magnetic design of Co3O4/CoFe2O4@NF, its resistance is reduced from 16 &#937; to 7&#160;&#937; under an optical&#8211;magnetic field (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mT). Furthermore, spin polarization occurs inducing the parallel alignment of oxygen atoms and the formation of paramagnetic triplet oxygen, reducing the reaction energy barrier, and improving the kinetics of the OER reaction. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in the optical&#8211;magnetic field is only 172.4&#160;mV, achieving a &#916;&#951; of 76.51&#160;mV.








Abstract
The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits water splitting, and external fields can help improve it. However, the effect of a single external field on the OER is limited and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism by which external fields improve the OER is unclear, particularly in the presence of multiple fields. Herein, a strategy is proposed for enhancing the OER activity of a catalyst using the combined effect of an optical&#8211;magnetic field, and the mechanism of catalytic activity enhancement is studied. Under the optical&#8211;magnetic field, Co3O4 reduces the resistance by increasing the catalyst temperature. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 further reduces the resistance via the negative magnetoresistance effect, thus decreasing the resistance from 16 to 7.0&#160;&#937;. Additionally, CoFe2O4 acts as a spin polarizer, and electron polarization results in a parallel arrangement of oxygen atoms, which increases the kinetics of the OER under the magnetic field. Benefiting from the optical and magnetic response design, Co3O4/CoFe2O4@Ni foam requires an overpotential of 172.4&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under an optical&#8211;magnetic field, which is significantly higher than those of recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Modulation on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>

         <dc:description>
A dual defect engineering strategy is developed to simultaneously create tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects. These defects in a Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) are created to modulate the spin state of Ni active sites and further optimize the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH* intermediates for accelerating OER kinetics, ensuring fast OER kinetics and enhanced OER activity.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are heavily correlated with hybridization of the transition metal d&#8208;orbital and oxygen intermediate p&#8208;orbital, which dictates the barriers of intermediate adsorption/desorption on the active sites of catalysts. Herein, a strategy is developed involving strain engineering and coordination regulation to enhance the hybridization of Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the as&#8208;synthesized Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) nanosheets deliver a low OER overpotential of 260&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. By integrating an alkaline anion exchange membrane electrolyzer and Pt/C electrode, 200 and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current densities are reached with cell voltages of 1.6 and 2.1&#160;V, respectively. When loaded on a BiVO4 photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar&#8208;driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive and Fast&#8208;Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm&#8208;shifting mold&#8208;free manufacturing is demonstrated for high&#8208;sensitivity and ultrafast responsive sensors using sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;m 3D&#8208;printing and conformal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymers. Much&#8208;enhanced sensing performance is achieved, compared to those manufactured with mold&#8208;based techniques, due to the high electrical conductivity of the sensing element, oxidative CVD&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene), and the benefits from the multiscale (from micrometer&#160;to millimeter) patterns.








Abstract
A new manufacturing paradigm is showcased to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. This mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D&#8208;printed multiscale microstructures as the substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt;60&#160;&#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185&#160;kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultrafast response time (&#8776;36&#160;&#181;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. These unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&amp;lt;60&#160;&#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185&#160;kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultrafast response time (&#8776;36&#160;&#181;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure-of-merit sensing performance. These unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost-effective manufacturing manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) carbon nanotubes are synthesized, and third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) processes with extreme polarization anisotropy in the broad spectral range are studied, due to the 1D character of CNTs. The THG processes are enhanced by exciton resonance (S11, S22, and M11 excitons) in both films, revealing coupling between the excitons and nonlinear effects.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their 1D character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs are synthesized and polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#181;m is studied. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength&#8208;dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (metallic CNTs), respectively are found, for 1.8&#160;&#181;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization&#8208;dependent THG measurements, the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor are determined, verifying the macroscopically 1D nature of the films. Finally, polarized THG imaging is performed to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large&#8208;size CNT film with good alignment. These findings promise applications of aligned CNT films in mid&#8208;infrared frequency conversion, nonlinear optical switching, polarized pulsed lasers, polarized long&#8208;wave detection, and high&#8208;performance anisotropic nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Enhancing Photocatalytic&#8208;Transfer Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkynes Over Pd/C3N4 Through Dual Regulation of Nitrogen Defects and the Mott&#8211;Schottky Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Schottky catalyst&#160;of Pd nanoparticles supported on graphite&#8208;like C3N4 with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN), &#160;containing a large number of cyano groups, is reported. The catalyst exhibits higher reactivity and selectivity in the selective transfer hydrogenation of alkynes under visible light.








Abstract
The selective hydrogenation of alkynes is an important reaction; however, the catalytic activity and selectivity in this reaction are generally conflicting. In this study, ultrafine Pd nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a graphite&#8208;like C3N4 structure with nitrogen defects (Pd/DCN) are synthesized. The resulting Pd/DCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic performance in the transfer hydrogenation of alkynes with ammonia borane. The reaction rate and selectivity of Pd/DCN are superior to those of Pd/BCN (bulk C3N4 without nitrogen defects) under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations show that the Mott&#8211;Schottky effect in Pd/DCN can change the electronic density of the Pd NPs, and thus enhances the hydrogenation selectivity toward phenylacetylene. After 1&#160;h, the hydrogenation selectivity of Pd/DCN reaches 95%, surpassing that of Pd/BCN (83%). Meanwhile, nitrogen defects in the supports improve the visible&#8208;light response and accelerate the transfer and separation of photogenerated charges to enhance the catalytic activity of Pd/DCN. Therefore, Pd/DCN exhibits higher efficiency under visible light, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 2002 min&#8722;1. This TOF is five times that of Pd/DCN under dark conditions and 1.5 times that of Pd/BCN. This study provides new insights into the rational design of high&#8208;performance photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Spectrum&#8211;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with a Dielectric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;spectrum&#8211;polarization recombinant optical encryption with all&#8208;silicon metasurface is reported. The arbitrary and continuous combination of polarization and wavelength channels enables the dramatic increase of information capacity to 210 or more. The high transmittance and large operation bandwidth in mid&#8208;infrared further promise the high&#8208;capability encryption communication application in this indispensable atmosphere window.








Abstract
The Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous&#8208;spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (210), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m). It is believed that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screen&#8208;printed flexible humidity sensors based on hexagonal tungsten oxide nanowires exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, and fast response in a wide relative humidity range, showing great potential in respiration rate monitoring, medicine packaging state monitoring, and non&#8208;contact measurements. Moreover, the sensitivity of the humidity sensors can be adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode.








Abstract
The utilization of printing techniques for the development of high&#8208;performance humidity sensors holds immense significance for various applications in the fields of the Internet of Things, agriculture, human healthcare, and storage environments. However, the long response time and low sensitivity of current printed humidity sensors limit their practical applications. Herein, a series of high&#8208;sensing&#8208;performance flexible resistive&#8208;type humidity sensors is fabricated by the screen&#8208;printing method, and hexagonal tungsten oxide (h&#8208;WO3) is employed as the humidity&#8208;sensing material due to its low cost, strong chemical adsorption ability, and excellent humidity&#8208;sensing ability. The as&#8208;prepared printed sensors exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, outstanding flexibility, low hysteresis, and fast response (1.5&#160;s) in a wide relative humidity (RH) range (11&#8211;95%&#160;RH). Furthermore, the sensitivity of humidity sensors can be easily adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode to meet the diverse requirements of specific applications. The printed flexible humidity sensors possess immense potential in various applications, including wearable devices, non&#8208;contact measurements, and packaging opening state monitoring.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Platelet Lysates Proteins into Microparticles by Unnatural Disulfide Bonds for Bottom&#8208;Up Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins from human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs) produce microparticles by forming unnatural disulfide bonds (&#8211;S&#8211;S&#8211;). In this study, protein&#8208;based microparticles are produced with defined surface topography and tunable size using a direct, simple, and low&#8208;cost methodology. These bioactive microstructures allow cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form and have applications in bottom&#8208;up approaches.








Abstract
There is a demand to design microparticles holding surface topography while presenting inherent bioactive cues for applications in the biomedical and biotechnological fields. Using the pool of proteins present in human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs), the production of protein&#8208;based microparticles via a simple and cost&#8208;effective method is reported, exploring the prone redox behavior of cysteine (Cy&#8208;SH) amino acid residues. The forced formation of new intermolecular disulfide bonds results in the precipitation of the proteins as spherical, pompom&#8208;like microparticles with adjustable sizes (15&#8211;50&#160;&#181;m in diameter) and surface topography consisting of grooves and ridges. These PL microparticles exhibit extraordinary cytocompatibility, allowing cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form, while also working as injectable systems for cell support. Early studies also suggest that the surface topography provided by these PL microparticles can support osteogenic behavior. Consequently, these PL microparticles may find use to create live tissues via bottom&#8208;up procedures or injectable tissue&#8208;defect fillers, particularly for bone regeneration, with the prospect of working under xeno&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>An H2O&#8208;Initiated Crosslinking Strategy for Ultrafine&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Reinforced High&#8208;Toughness Polymer&#8208;In&#8208;Plasticizer Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel crosslinking strategy where metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator is proposed. After incorporating a high concentration of plasticizers, the polymer&#8208;in&#8208;plasticizer solid electrolyte still maintains outstanding mechanical properties, thus demonstrating fast lithium&#8208;conduction kinetics and effective inhibition of lithium dendrites simultaneously.








Abstract
Incorporating plasticizers is an effective way to facilitate conduction of ions in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, this conductivity enhancement often comes at the cost of reduced mechanical properties, which can make the electrolyte membrane more difficult to process and increase safety hazards. Here, a novel crosslinking strategy, wherein metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator, is proposed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, trimethylaluminum (TMA)&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is used to demonstrate that ultrafine Al&#8211;O nanoclusters can serve as nodes to crosslink PEO chains with a wide range of molecular weights from 10&#160;000 to 8&#160;000&#160;000&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1. The crosslinked polymer network can incorporate a high concentration of plasticizers, with a total weight percentage over 75%, while still maintaining excellent stretchability (4640%) and toughness (3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.41&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), low interfacial resistance toward Li metal (48.1&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2), and a wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.8&#160;V vs Li+/Li) at 30&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery shows stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 98.6% (146.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) over 1000 cycles at 1C (1C&#160;=&#160;170&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Reconstructed Hierarchically Structured Keratin Fibers with Shape&#8208;Memory Features Based on Reversible Secondary&#8208;Structure Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose via wet&#8208;spinning in a more cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The reconfiguration of the keratin secondary structure is proposed as the mechanism of the water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory effect. The smart keratin fibers show the potential to be applied as artificial muscles.








Abstract
Biocompatible and biodegradable shape&#8208;memory polymers have gained popularity as smart materials, offering a wide range of applications and environmental benefits. Herein, the possibility of fabricating regenerated water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers from wool and cellulose in a more effective and environmentally friendly manner is investigated. The regenerated keratin fibers exhibit comparable shape&#8208;memory performance to other hydration&#8208;responsive materials, with a shape&#8208;fixity ratio of 94.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.15% and a shape&#8208;recovery rate of 81.4&#160;&#177;&#160;3.84%. Owing to their well&#8208;preserved secondary structure and cross&#8208;linking network, keratin fibers exhibit outstanding water&#8208;stability and wet stretchability, with a maximum tensile strain of 362&#160;&#177;&#160;15.9%. In this system, the reconfiguration of the protein secondary structure between &#945;&#8208;helix and &#946;&#8208;sheet is investigated as the fundamental actuation mechanism in response to hydration. This responsiveness is studied under force loading and unloading along the fiber axis. Hydrogen bonds act as the &#8220;switches&#8221; clicked by water molecules to trigger the shape&#8208;memory effect, while disulfide bonds and cellulose nanocrystals play the role of &#8220;net&#8208;points&#8221; to maintain the permanent shape of the material. Water&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory keratin fibers are manipulable and exhibit potential in the fabrication of textile actuators, which may be applied in smart apparel and programmable biomedical devices.

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive, and Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel with a double&#8208;network architecture is created from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer self&#8208;assembly peptide. Its strong tissue adhesion facilitates excellent integration in the host and demonstrates self&#8208;healing feature. The novel hydrogel demonstrates a strong capability of promoting exuberant neural regeneration after spinal cord injury and consequently promotes sensory and motor functions, particularly protecting the urinary system.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffolds show promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI is developed. The hydrogel is composed of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to conventional hydrogels, this hydrogel ensures a significant promotion of immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries are enhanced, including motor function, sensory function, and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, this proposed hydrogel represents an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>A Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>

PM6 polycrystals are incubated through a vapor diffusion method and redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates, which can increase the structural order of both the donors and the acceptors in photovoltaic blends upon solution casting, consequently delivering high performance for both thin and thick junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid&#8208;state films, which leads to low charge&#8208;transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy orders the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that are incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals are redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which is found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both the PM6 and the L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 nm&#8208;thick and 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick photoactive layer, respectively.

A self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem is decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) for delivering small interfering RNA to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1, generating simultaneous inhibition of glycolysis and programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 interaction with blockage on tumor growth. This study highlights the potential of the dendrimer platform for elaborating combined and precision therapy.








Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. Here an effective strategy is reported for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is established for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1 (PDK1), a kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem, named PPD, is designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer&#8208;specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively generates simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of the tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside a unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

         <title>Circular Reprocessing of Thermoset Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam reprocessing of thermoset polyurethane is reported for circular recycling of polyurethane products. As carbamate exchange catalysts enable melt&#8208;reprocessing of thermoset polyurethanes, extrusion foaming and foam injection molding of polyurethane are demonstrated, and the potential scalability is assessed. The structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship of the processes is investigated to achieve low&#8208;density foam with comparable mechanical properties to those of as&#8208;synthesized polyurethane foams.








Abstract
Thermoset polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in industrial applications, but they cannot be recycled by conventional melt reprocessing because of their cross&#8208;linked structures. The introduction of carbamate exchange catalysts converts thermoset PU into covalent adaptable networks (CANs), which are amenable to reprocessing at elevated temperatures. However, this approach has produced solid PU films, which have fewer uses and lower commercial demand. In this work, simultaneous reprocessing and refoaming of thermoset PU foams is demonstrated by leveraging the melt&#8208;processability of PU CANs and allowing cell growth by gas generation in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The optimal operating temperature of the refoaming process is determined through chemical, thermal, and structural analysis of PU foam extrudates. The foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam extrusion process produces controllable, continuous, and uniform foam structures, as characterized by cell diameter and cell number density. Low&#8208;density PU foams are obtained through a process simulating injection molding. The compression properties of reprocessed PU foam are compared with as&#8208;synthesized PU foam to demonstrate efficacy of the refoaming processes. These results demonstrate that PU foams can be prepared through recycling while maintaining microstructural and chemical integrity. In the future, this strategy may be applied to thermoset PU foams of various chemical compositions and shows promise for scalability.

A structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 to improve the reaction kinetics and cycling stability for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D NiBi3 with metallic conductivity and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers high&#8208;rate capability and superior cycling performance for Na/K storage.








Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured bismuth (Bi) is an attractive anode for Na&#8208;ion and K&#8208;ion batteries due to its large volumetric capacity and suitable redox potentials. However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K&#8208;storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting&#160;2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;1D structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high&#8208;rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and 3D Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g&#8722;1) after 15&#160;000 cycles for Na&#8208;ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K&#8208;storage reaction mechanisms and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high&#8208;performance anode design by structural dimensionality manipulation and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction.

Benefiting from excellent electrical conductivity, abundant Cu&#9472;O4 species, and adsorbed iodide at the Cu sites of the Cu&#8208;HHB/I2, an assembled NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver a superior energy density (31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2) and record&#8208;long cycling lifetime (89.5% after 10&#160;000 cycles).








Abstract
Ammonium ions (NH4+) are emerging non&#8208;metallic charge carriers for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, due to their low cost, elemental abundance, and environmental benignity. However, finding suitable electrode materials to achieve rapid diffusion kinetics for NH4+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, a 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) for immobilizing iodine, as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors, is reported. Cu&#8208;HHB (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene) MOF embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) features excellent electrical conductivity, highly porous structure, and rich accessible active sites of copper&#8208;bis(dihydroxy) (Cu&#9472;O4) and iodide species, resulting in a remarkable areal capacitance of 111.7 mF cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the Cu&#9472;O4 species in Cu&#8208;HHB play a critical role in binding polyiodide and suppressing its dissolution, as well as contributing to a large pseudocapacitance with adsorbed iodide. In combination with a porous MXene anode, the full NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver an excellent energy density of 31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 89.5% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, superior to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. This study sheds light on the material design for NH4+ storage, enabling the development of novel high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;Doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memcapacitive&#8208;synapse&#8208;based physical reservoir computing (RC) system is reported. The device's intrinsic property matches the dynamics of multisensory information processing. A touchless user interface (TUI) for a virtual shopping system is demonstrated, benefitting from the robustness and versatility of such a device, which is of profound implication for energy&#8208;efficient human&#8722;computer interface and edge computing apparatus.








Abstract
Hardware implementation tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but have not been experimentally exploited yet. Here, this work&#160;reports an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could originate from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium&#8208;oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8776;113.4 fJ per spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. This&#160;system is verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping based on the&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system is demonstrated, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. These&#160;results shed light on the development of highly power&#8208;efficient human&#8211;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

         <title>Generation of Terahertz Radiation via the Transverse Thermoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense terahertz radiation generation via the transverse thermoelectric effect in layered conducting transition metal oxides is demonstrated . Ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, induced by femtosecond laser pulses on thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents leading to efficient THz emission. This approach offers a simple and promising avenue for versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful tool with widespread applications ranging from imaging, sensing, and broadband communications to spectroscopy and nonlinear control of materials. Future progress in THz technology depends on the development of efficient, structurally simple THz emitters that can be implemented in advanced miniaturized devices. Here, it is shown how the natural electronic anisotropy of layered conducting transition metal oxides enables the generation of intense terahertz radiation via the transverse thermoelectric effect. In thin films grown on off&#8208;cut substrates, femtosecond laser pulses generate ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, which in turn launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents, thus allowing efficient emission of the resulting THz field out of the film structure. This scheme is demonstrated in experiments on thin films of the layered metals PdCoO2 and La1.84Sr0.16CuO4, and model calculations that elucidate the influence of the material parameters on the intensity and spectral characteristics of the emitted THz field are presented. Due to its simplicity, the method opens up a promising avenue for the development of highly versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.

         <title>Photoinduced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical cloaking in microgels: a diarylethene photoswitch is introduced as a co&#8208;crosslinker into PVCL microgels. Light&#8208;induced photoswitching of the diaryethene results in a phase&#8208;transition shift and thus changes the swelling status of microgels at a fixed temperature, rendering them differently reactive to mechanical force.








Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as a crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase&#8208;transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8211;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated by the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photoinduced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Iridium&#8208;Based Selective Emitters for Thermophotovoltaic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superior oxidation resistance of Ir, having a low Gibbs energy of oxide formation, in an Ir/HfO2&#8208;based selective emitter at 1000&#160;&#176;C over 100&#160;h at 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar is demonstrated in comparison to refractory W, in a W/HfO2 selective emitter. 6 layers of Ir are stable after annealing, whereas W layers vanish due to oxidation and sublimation.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term operation of refractory&#8208;metal&#8208;based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb, and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here, the use of the noble metal Ir is proposed, which is stable to oxidation and has optical properties comparable to gold. The thermal endurance of Ir in a 3&#8208;layer&#8208;system, consisting of HfO2/Ir/HfO2, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#160;&#176;C in a pressure range from 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;6&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar, is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;The superior oxidation resistance of Ir, having a low Gibbs energy of oxide formation, in an Ir/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based selective emitter at 1000&#160;&#176;C over 100&#160;h at 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mbar is demonstrated in comparison to refractory W, in a W/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selective emitter. 6 layers of Ir are stable after annealing, whereas W layers vanish due to oxidation and sublimation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term operation of refractory-metal-based metamaterials is crucial for applications such as thermophotovoltaics. The metamaterials based on refractory metals like W, Mo, Ta, Nb, and Re fail primarily by oxidation. Here, the use of the noble metal Ir is proposed, which is stable to oxidation and has optical properties comparable to gold. The thermal endurance of Ir in a 3-layer-system, consisting of HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Ir/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, by performing annealing experiments up to 1240&#160;&#176;C in a pressure range from 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mbar to 1&#160;bar, is demonstrated. The Ir layer shows no oxidation in a vacuum and inert gas atmosphere. At temperatures above 1100&#160;&#176;C, the Ir layer starts to agglomerate due to the degradation of the confining HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers. An in situ X-ray diffraction experimental comparison between 1D multilayered Ir/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and W/HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selective emitters annealed at 1000&#160;&#176;C, 2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;mbar, over 100&#160;h, confirms oxidation stability of Ir while W multilayers gradually disappear. The results of this work show that W-based metamaterials are not long-term stable even at 1000&#160;&#176;C. However, the oxidation resistance of Ir can be leveraged for refractory plasmonic metamaterials, such as selective emitters in thermophotovoltaic systems with strong suppression of long wavelength radiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Customized Microenvironments Spontaneously Facilitate Coupled Engineering of Real&#8208;Life Large&#8208;Scale Clean Water Capture and Pollution Remediation</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of drinking water directly from contaminated seawater is proposed. The strategy is based on a novel coupling perspective (parallel reaction space) to achieve photocatalytic degradation of pollutants while capturing clean water. It is demonstrated that this evaporator (CCMs&#8208;x) is widely adaptable and persistent to multiple real&#8208;life scenarios with excellent scalability. This work makes it crucial to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism and gain insight into the performance of catalytic materials at the microscopic level.








Abstract
Harnessing abundant renewable resources and pollutants on a large scale to address environmental challenges, while providing sustainable freshwater, is a significant endeavour. This study presents the design of fully functional solar vaporization devices (SVD) based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposites (CCMs&#8208;x). These devices exhibit efficient photothermal properties that facilitate multitargeted interfacial reactions, enabling simultaneous catalysis of sewage and desalination. The localized interfacial heating generated by the photothermal effect of CCMs&#8208;x triggers surface&#8208;dominated catalysis and steam generation. The CCMs&#8208;x SVD achieves a solar water&#8208;vapor generation rate of 1.41&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (90.8%), and it achieves over 95% removal of pollutants within 60&#160;min under one&#8208;sun for practical application. The exceptional photothermal conversion rate of wastewater for environmental remediation and water capture is attributed to customized microenvironments within the system. The integrated parallel reaction system in SVD ensures it is a real&#8208;life application in multiple scenarios such as municipal/medical wastewater and brine containing high concentrations. Additionally, the SVD exhibits long&#8208;term durability, antifouling functionality toward complex ionic contaminants. This study not only demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds strategy for large&#8208;scale direct production of potable water from polluted seawater, but also opens up exciting possibilities for parallel production of energy and water resources.

         <title>Giant Atomic Swirl in Graphene Bilayers with Biaxial Heterostrain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxial heterostrain in bilayer graphene leads to a new atomic lattice relaxation to minimize the stacking energy. Elastic energy is stored in solitons hosting topological states. This demonstrates that heterostrain can be an additional tuning parameter in moir&#233; materials opening new possibilities for moir&#233; engineering.








Abstract
The study of moir&#233; engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, in which stacking 2D layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir&#233; pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it&#160;was&#160;found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly&#8208;correlated&#8208;electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. A twist is now routinely used to adjust the properties of 2D materials. This study investigates a new type of moir&#233; superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other&#8212;so&#8208;called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry&#8208;breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight&#8208;binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir&#233; engineering in van der Waals&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Suppressed Concentration Quenching Brightens Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The well&#8208;known concentration quenching phenomenon is intrinsically suppressed in sensitized luminescent systems by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, thereby unlocking the full potential of sensitization strategy in enhancing photoexcitation efficiency of doped luminescent materials and providing a new approach to achieve high&#8208;purity sensitized luminescence.








Abstract
The brightness of doped luminescent materials is usually limited by the ubiquitous concentration quenching phenomenon resulting in an intractable tradeoff between internal quantum efficiency and excitation efficiency. Here, an intrinsic suppression of concentration quenching in sensitized luminescent systems, by exploiting the competitive relationship between light emitters and quenchers in trapping excitation energies from sensitizers, is reported. Although Cr3+ sensitizers and trivalent lanthanide (Ln3+, Ln = Yb, Nd, and Er) emitters themselves are highly susceptible to concentration quenching, the unprecedentedly high&#8208;brightness luminescence of Cr3+&#8211;Ln3+ systems is demonstrated in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) range employing high concentrations of Cr3+, whereby a record photoelectric efficiency of 23% is achieved for SWIR phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes, which is about twice as high as those previously reported. The results underscore the beneficial role of emitters in terminating excitation energies, opening up a new dimension for developing efficient sensitized luminescent materials.

         <title>Tuning the Organ Tropism of Polymersome for Spleen&#8208;Selective Nanovaccine Delivery to Boost Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>

A well&#8208;designed polymersome library reveals specific organ selectivity to the liver and spleen. With the advanced tailoring of splenic immune responses, spleen targeting nanovaccine can effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.








Abstract
The past few decades have witnessed explosive development in drug delivery systems. However, in vivo delivery suffers from non&#8208;specific distribution in non&#8208;targeted organs or tissues, which may cause undesired side effects and even genotoxicity. Here, a general strategy that enables tuning the tropism of polymersomes for liver&#8208; and spleen&#8208;selective delivery is reported. By using a library screening approach, spleen&#8208;targeted polymersome PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 and liver&#8208;targeted polymersome PA9&#8208;ZP3&#8208;5050 are identified accordingly. Meanwhile, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. O ur findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, PH9&#8208;Aln&#8208;8020 is employed as a systemic nanocarrier to co&#8208;deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ&#8208;selective delivery and other biomedical applications.

Meanwhile, the second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging allows for in vivo dynamic evaluation of their spatial and temporal accumulation in specific tissues. O ur findings indicate that both polymer composition and protein corona on the surface are essential to determine the in vivo fate of polymersomes and tendency for specific organs. Importantly, PH9-Aln-8020 is employed as a systemic nanocarrier to co-deliver the antigen and adjuvant, which remarkably boost splenic immune responses in acute myeloid leukemia, melanoma, and melanoma lung metastasis mouse models. This study may open a new frontier for polymersomes in organ-selective delivery and other biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating the d&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported&#160;ultrafine Pt3Fe alloy nanoparticles (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. Owing to the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions that intentionally modulate the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, both the required energy barrier for H2O dissociation and adsorption energy for H* intermediates are reduced, thereby resulting in the enhanced HER activities of Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions.








Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotentials (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m&#160;H2SO4, 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH, and 1.0&#160;m phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt&#8208;based alloys for practical applications.

         <title>A Bifunctional Catalyst for Green Ammonia Synthesis from Ubiquitous Air and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni applying to plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic synthesis of NH3 from air and water is proposed, with which a record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and excellent FE of 96.8% can be obtained. Moreover, the reaction system is enlarged and the generated NH3 precipitates into MgNH4PO4&#183;6H2O solid to promote the practical application.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is essential for modern agriculture and industry, and, due to its high hydrogen density and no carbon emission, it is also expected to be the next&#8208;generation of &#8220;clean&#8221; energy carrier. Herein, directly from air and water, a plasma&#8208;electrocatalytic reaction system for NH3 production, which combines two steps of plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and electrochemical NOx&#8722; reduction reaction (eNOxRR) with a bifunctional catalyst, is successfully established. Especially, the bifunctional catalyst of CuCo2O4/Ni can simultaneously promote plasma&#8208;air&#8208;to&#8208;NOx&#8722; and eNOxRR processes. The easy adsorption and activation of O2 by CuCo2O4/Ni greatly improve the NOx&#8722; production rate at the first step. Further, CuCo2O4/Ni can also resolve the overbonding of the key intermediate of *NO, and thus reduce the energy barrier of the second step of eNOxRR. Finally, the &#8220;green&#8221; NH3 production achieves excellent FENH3 (96.8%) and record&#8208;high NH3 yield rate of 145.8&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with large partial current density (1384.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). Moreover, an enlarged self&#8208;made H&#8208;type electrolyzer improves the NH3 yield to 3.6&#160;g&#160;h&#8722;1, and the obtained NH3 is then rapidly converted to a solid of magnesium ammonium phosphate hexahydrate, which favors the easy storage and transportation of NH3.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;featured non&#8208;conjugated polymers with largely enhanced thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance are demonstrated, in which a secondary phosphine oxide acceptor is introduced to balance intra&#8208; and interchain charge transfer for radiation facilitation and non&#8208;radiation suppression, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 30%, respectively.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT can markedly improve performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this work, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by way of a series of non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing a 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO)&#8208;based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve balanced intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT by accurately optimizing the inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. The DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. This demonstrates that, compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT&#8208;based copolymers for radiation, and suppress singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photocontrolled Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared using a commodity polyacrylonitrile and reversible crosslinker via reversible metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The thermosets are mechanically robust, and they are recyclable via reversible coordination upon light irradiation in a solvent and heating. This reversible coordination method enables the preparation of recyclable materials using other commodity polymers and polymer composites. The thermosets can be recycled from plastic waste.








Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed in over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. In this work, recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8211;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. In addition, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be de&#8208;crosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. The preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as poly(styrene&#8208;coacrylonitrile) (SAN) resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking is also demonstrated. This study shows that reversible crosslinking via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

Hydrogel Soft Actuators
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap between rigid machines interacting with soft matter. In article number 2302816, Rainer Adelung, Fabian Sch&#252;tt, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the incorporation of a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix dramatically enhances actuation performance, thereby overcoming water&#8208;transport limitations in hydrogel soft actuators while providing options for both light&#8208; and electrically&#8208;controlled actuation.

Mechanical Microgel Cloaking
Concepts to control mechanical polymer degradation on demand are one possible pathway toward a sustainable polymer future. In article 2305845, Robert G&#246;stl and co&#8208;workers gate the mechanochemical degradation of microgels as prototypical material platform by light. The observed mechanical cloaking effect is caused by a photoinduced phase transition, hence operates on the polymer topology level, and might be universally applicable.

Resistive Switching
In article number 2302979, Wen&#8208;Wei Wu and co&#8208;workers systematically investigate the resistive&#8208;switching performance and mechanisms of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO)&#8208;based memristors. The SET/RESET behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt. This novel high&#8208;performance resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) device paves a new avenue toward memristors and holds great potential for various applications.

         <title>Advances in In Vitro Models of Neuromuscular Junction: Focusing on Organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip, Organoids, and Biohybrid Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the advances in in vitro neuromuscular junction models with 2D and 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robots, and introduces the related derivative techniques for functional analysis and stimulus methods, their application as disease models and for drug screening, and prospects for their future development and related challenges.








Abstract
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a peripheral synaptic connection between presynaptic motor neurons and postsynaptic skeletal muscle fibers that enables muscle contraction and voluntary motor movement. Many traumatic, neurodegenerative, and neuroimmunological diseases are classically believed to mainly affect either the neuronal or the muscle side of the NMJ, and treatment options are lacking. Recent advances in novel techniques have helped develop in vitro physiological and pathophysiological models of the NMJ as well as enable precise control and evaluation of its functions. This paper reviews the recent developments in in vitro NMJ models with 2D or 3D cultures, from organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip and organoids to biohybrid robotics. Related derivative techniques are introduced for functional analysis of the NMJ, such as the patch&#8208;clamp technique, microelectrode arrays, calcium imaging, and stimulus methods, particularly optogenetic&#8208;mediated light stimulation, microelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation, and biochemical stimulation. Finally, the applications of the in vitro NMJ models as disease models or for drug screening related to suitable neuromuscular diseases are summarized and their future development trends and challenges are discussed.

         <title>Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next&#8208;generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.








Abstract
Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high&#8208;end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode and liquid crystal display industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light&#8208;induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer&#8208;scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviews recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high&#8208;resolution QD patterns. The paper also discusses prospects for future research directions.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Deficient Bioceramics: Combination of Diagnosis, Therapy, and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 41, October 12, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fourth generation of bioceramics called colored/oxygen&#8208;deficient for biomedical applications are introduced in this review. The importance of this class of bioceramics can be defined through multifunctionality since they are regarded as the connection between the past and future. The microstructure, applications, potential challenges, future trends, and perspectives are discussed in detail.








Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation&#8212;alumina, zirconia, etc.&#8212;to the third &#8212;3D scaffolds. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics, which have recently found their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and near infrared regions, making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, diagnostic, and regenerative. Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies, respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8722;x, MoO3&#8722;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, and WO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanical Signal&#8208;Tailored Hydrogel Microspheres Recruit and Train Stem Cells for Precise Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposed an enhanced endogenous regeneration strategy to direct stem cell differentiation via mechanotransduction. Microfluidic hydrogel microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus and ECM ligand density are fabricated and demonstrated to recruit intervertebral disc progenitor/stem cells and train them to differentiate into nucleus pulposus&#8208;like cells for repairing intervertebral disc degeneration.








Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction is constructed . Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres are prepared with the independently tunable elastic modulus (1&#8211;10Kpa) and ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) can support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) is loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated matrix synthesis. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

         <title>Nanotargeted Delivery of Immune Therapeutics in Type 1 Diabetes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted delivery platform for type 1 diabetes (T1D) treatment using high endothelial venule (HEV)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles is developed. The HEV&#8208;targeting nanoplatform delivers anti&#8208;CD3 antibodies simultaneously to pancreatic lymph nodes and pancreata, thereby suppressing effector T cells and prolonging the reversal of T1D in a nonobese diabetic mouse model.








Abstract
Immune therapeutics holds great promise in the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Nonetheless, their progress is hampered by limited efficacy, equipoise, or issues of safety. To address this, a novel and specific nanodelivery platform for T1D that targets high endothelial venules (HEVs) presented in the pancreatic lymph nodes (PLNs) and pancreas is developed. Data indicate that the pancreata of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and patients with T1D are unique in their expression of newly formed HEVs. Anti&#8208;CD3 mAb is encapsulated in poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) nanoparticles (NPs), the surfaces of which are conjugated with MECA79 mAb that recognizes HEVs. Targeted delivery of these NPs improves accumulation of anti&#8208;CD3 mAb in both the PLNs and pancreata of NOD mice. Treatment of hyperglycemic NOD mice with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs results in significant reversal of T1D compared to those that are untreated, treated with empty NPs, or provided free anti&#8208;CD3. This effect is associated with a significant reduction of T effector cell populations in the PLNs and a decreased production of pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine in the mice treated with MECA79&#8208;anti&#8208;CD3&#8208;NPs. In summary, HEV&#8208;targeted therapeutics may be used as a means by which immune therapeutics can be delivered to PLNs and pancreata to suppress autoimmune diabetes effectively.

         <title>Erasable, Rewritable, and Reprogrammable Dual Information Encryption Based on Photoluminescent Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Recognition and Hydrogel Shape Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating the fluorescence of a well&#8208;designed self&#8208;inclusion supramolecular fluorescent ink immobilized in a polymer brush on a hydrogel surface through host&#8211;guest recognition. This supramolecular recognition is combined with the shape&#8208;memory effect of responsive hydrogel to achieve dual&#8208;encryption.








Abstract
Information encryption technologies are very important for security, health, commodity, and communications, etc. Novel information encryption mechanisms and materials are desired to achieve multimode and reprogrammable encryption. Here, a supramolecular strategy is demonstrated to achieve multimodal, erasable, reprogrammable, and reusable information encryption by reversibly modulating fluorescence. A butyl&#8208;naphthalimide with flexible ethylenediamine functionalized &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (N&#8208;CD) is utilized as a fluorescent responsive ink for printing or patterning information on polymer brushes with dangling adamantane group grafted on responsive hydrogels. The photoluminescent naphthalimide moiety is bonded to &#946;&#8208;CD and entrapped in the cavity. Its fluorescence is highly weakened in &#946;&#8208;CD cavity and recovers after being expelled from the cavity by a competing guest molecule to emit bright green photoluminescence under UV. Experiments and theoretical calculations suggest &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking and ICT as the primary mechanism for the naphthalimides assembly and fluorescence, which can be quenched through insertion of conjugated molecules and recover by removing the insert. Such reversible quenching and recovering are used to achieve repeated writing, erasing, and re&#8208;writing of information. Supramolecular recognition and hydrogel shape memory are further combined to achieve reversible dual&#8208;encryption. This study provides a novel strategy to develop smart materials with improved information security for broad applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Subpicosecond Magnetization of a 2D Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first sub&#8208;ps (&#8776;600&#160;fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well is successfully demonstrated, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This hopefully opens a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information processing.








Abstract
Strong spin&#8208;charge interactions in several ferromagnets are expected to lead to subpicosecond (sub&#8208;ps) magnetization of the magnetic materials through control of the carrier characteristics via electrical means, which is essential for ultrafast spin&#8208;based electronic devices. Thus far, ultrafast control of magnetization has been realized by optically pumping a large number of carriers into the d or f orbitals of a ferromagnet; however, it is extremely challenging to implement by electrical gating. This work demonstrates a new method for sub&#8208;ps magnetization manipulation called wavefunction engineering, in which only the spatial distribution (wavefunction) of s (or p) electrons is controlled and no change is required in the total carrier density. Using&#160;a ferromagnetic semiconductor (FMS) (In,Fe)As quantum well (QW), instant enhancement, as fast as 600&#160;fs, of the magnetization is observed upon irradiating a femtosecond (fs) laser pulse. Theoretical&#160;analysis shows that the instant enhancement of the magnetization is induced when the 2D electron wavefunctions (WFs) in the FMS QW are rapidly moved by a photo&#8208;Dember electric field formed by an asymmetric distribution of the photocarriers. Because this WF engineering method can be equivalently implemented by applying a gate electric field, these results open a new way to realize ultrafast magnetic storage and spin&#8208;based information processing in present electronic systems.

         <title>Organic Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), which integrate electroluminescence, current switching, and polarized emission into one device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization of 0.97. The high polarization characteristics of the OPLETs are assigned to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of molecular properties. High&#8208;contrast optical imaging and modern anti&#8208;counterfeit security based on OPLETs are demonstrated, establishing a new direction for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Electrically driven polarized light&#8208;emitting sources are central to various applications including quantum computers, optical communication, and 3D displays, but serious challenges remain due to the inevitable incorporation of complex optical elements in conventional devices. Here, organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), a kind of novel device that integrates the functions of organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and polarizers into one unique device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization (DOP) as high as 0.97, which is comparable to completely linearly polarized light (DOP = 1). Under the modulation of gate voltage, robust and efficient polarization emission is proven, ascribed to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of the molecular transition dipole moment in organic semiconductors and the open&#8208;ended feature of OPLETs instead of other factors. As a result, high&#8208;contrast optical imaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on&#8208;chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.

         <title>A Nanodisc&#8208;Paved Biobridge Facilitates Stem Cell Membrane Fusogenicity for Intracerebral Shuttling and Bystander Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A membrane fusogenicity technology using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides is designed to functionalize mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) through a lipid raft&#8208;mediated membrane fusion pathway. For Alzheimer's disease therapy, 4F&#8211;VBP (HDL) is assembled for MSC4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) fabrication. After systemic infusion, MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) recognize pathological vascular clues for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing, achieving bystander effects on neurons and microglia.








Abstract
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies experience steadfast clinical advances but are still hindered by inefficient site&#8208;specific migration. An adaptable MSC membrane fusogenicity technology is conceptualized for lipid raft&#8208;mediated targeting ligand embedding by using toolkits of discoidal high&#8208;density lipoprotein (HDL)&#8208;containing biomimicking 4F peptides. According to the pathological clues of brain diseases, the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 specialized VBP peptide is fused with 4F to assemble 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL), which acts as a biobridge and transfers VBP onto the living cell membrane via lipid rafts for surface engineering of MSCs in suspension. When compared with the membrane&#8208;modifying strategies of PEGylated phospholipids, 4F&#8208;VBP (HDL) provides a 3.86 higher linkage efficiency to obtain MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL), which can recognize and adhere to the inflammatory endothelium for efficient blood&#8211;brain barrier crossing and brain accumulation. In APPswe/PSEN1dE9 mice with Alzheimer's disease (AD), the transcriptomic analysis reveals that systemic administration of MSCs4F&#8211;VBP(HDL) can activate pathways associated with neuronal activity and diminish neuroinflammation for rewiring AD brains. This customizable HDL&#8208;mediated membrane fusogenicity platform primes MSC inflammatory brain delivery, which can be expanded to other disease treatments by simply fusing 4F with relevant ligands for living cell engineering.

         <title>Trivalent Europium&#8208;Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots are introduced in FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 (Cs&#8211;FA) PSCs and simultaneously exert the talent of Cs&#8211;FA PSCs on stability, which maintains the optimal bandgap of FAPbI3 and offsets the Cs&#8208;induced local strain with a high power conversion efficiency of 24.13%.








Abstract
Cesium&#8211;formamidinium (Cs&#8211;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8211;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8211;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). In this work, &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl, Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots, are&#160;developed to solve the key issues in Cs&#8211;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promotes the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8211;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8211;I cluster. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Intense Hydrochromic Photon Upconversion from Lead&#8208;Free 0D Metal Halides For Water Detection and Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new 0D lead&#8208;free metal halide upconversion smart material is developed and applied as a moisture sensor. It exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Additionally, this upconversion smart material is applied to cipher text information encryption via a laser&#8208;based optical lighting method.








Abstract
Hydrochromic materials that change their luminescence color upon exposure to moisture have attracted considerable attention owing to their applications in sensing and information encryption. However, the existing materials lack high hydrochromic response and color tunability. This study reports the development of a new and bright 0D Cs3GdCl6 metal halide as the host for hydrochromic photon upconversion in the form of polycrystals (PCs) and nanocrystals. Lanthanides co&#8208;doped cesium gadolinium chloride metal halides exhibit upconversion luminescence (UCL) in the visible&#8211;infrared region upon 980&#160;nm laser excitation. In particular, PCs co&#8208;doped with Yb3+ and Er3+ exhibit hydrochromic UCL color change from green to red. These hydrochromic properties are quantitatively confirmed through the sensitive detection of water in tetrahydrofuran solvent via UCL color changes. This water&#8208;sensing probe exhibits excellent repeatability and is particularly suitable for real&#8208;time and long&#8208;term water monitoring. Furthermore, the hydrochromic UCL property is exploited for stimuli&#8208;responsive information encryption via cyphertexts. These findings will pave the way for the development of new hydrochromic upconverting materials for emerging applications, such as noncontact sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Error&#8208;Correction Learning Accelerates Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning model using error&#8208;correction learning with experimental feedback is developed to predict high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Experimentally a new family of thermoelectric materials consisting of PbSe:SnSb is achieved, which exhibits large power factor at room temperature.








Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here, historical data is incorporated, and is updated using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). This is achieved by learning from prior datasets and then&#160;adapting the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. This strategy is thus applied to discovering thermoelectric materials, where synthesis is prioritized at temperatures &lt;300&#160;&#176;C. A previously unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, is documented, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2&#215; that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3&#215; compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning (ML) models. It is also observed that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.

         <title>Achieving All&#8208;Plateau and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon is constructed through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy. Evidence from advanced techniques indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements, resulting in a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Advancing In Situ Food Monitoring through a Smart Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package System Demonstrated by the Detection of Salmonella in Whole Chicken</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a Salmonella&#8208;specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready&#8208;to&#8208;eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real&#8208;world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.








Abstract
With food production shifting away from traditional farm&#8208;to&#8208;table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture&#8208;based methods has increased, despite its lack of real&#8208;time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221; is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent&#8208;infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent&#8208;immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered Salmonella&#8208;responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands&#8208;free detection of 103 colony forming units (CFU) g&#8722;1 target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken. The platform remains effective when contamination is introduced with toolsand surfaces, ensuring widespread efficacy. Its real&#8208;world use for in situ detection is simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well&#8208;known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high&#8208;performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule&#8208;mediated ion memristors.








Abstract
Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, the well&#8208;known tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is introduced with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into a stable polymers framework to modulate Ag migration and then achieve high&#8208;performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles, and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrates&#160;that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, the TCNQ molecule distribution can be modulated inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by Raman mapping, in situ conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM), X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus the controllable molecule&#8208;mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high&#8208;performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule&#8208;mediated ion movements.

         <title>Direct Observation of Atomic Step&#8208;Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;In situ atomic-scale electron microscopy combined with first-principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.

&lt;p&gt;Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic-scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step-assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces.

While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in-plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step-edge atoms; the step-edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step-edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first-principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out-of-plane and in-plane electric fields. This hitherto unknown mechanism reveals the central role of step reconstruction in stabilizing a polar surface, providing valuable insights for understanding the novel charge compensation mechanism accompanied by the step reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;2D Polypyrrole Film with Band&#8208;Like Transport Behavior and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first band&#8208;like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H2SO4&#8208;interface&#8208;assisted approach, a quasi&#8208;2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge&#8208;carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, attributed to the efficient band&#8208;like short&#8208;range transport in q2DPPy.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H2SO4 (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS reveals a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.

         <title>Triiodide Attacks the Organic Cation in Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites: Mechanism and Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triiodide is formed from thermally stressed lead halide perovskites. It hydrogen bonds strongly with organic cations in these materials, and it induces, catalytically, their deprotonation leading to perovskite decomposition. A simple thiol applied to the perovskite surface interrupts the catalytic cycle, and when applied at the perovskite&#8211;hole&#8208;transport material interface, creates a surface dipole that facilitates hole injection.








Abstract
Molecular I2 can be produced from iodide&#8208;based lead perovskites under thermal stress; triiodide, I3&#8722;, is formed from this I2 and I&#8722;. Triiodide attacks protic cation MA+&#8208; or FA+&#8208;based lead halide perovskites (MA+, methylammonium; FA+, formamidinium) as explicated through solution&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies: triiodide has strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding affinity for MA+ or FA+, which leads to their deprotonation and perovskite decomposition. Triiodide is a catalyst for this decomposition that can be obviated through perovskite surface treatment with thiol reducing agents. In contrast to methods using thiol incorporation into perovskite precursor solutions, no penetration of the thiol into the bulk perovskite is observed, yet its surface application stabilizes the perovskite against triiodide&#8208;mediated thermal stress. Thiol applied to the interface between FAPbI3 and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (&#8220;Spiro&#8221;) prevents oxidized iodine species penetration into Spiro and thus preserves its hole&#8208;transport efficacy. Surface&#8208;applied thiol affects the perovskite work function; it ameliorates hole injection into the Spiro overlayer, thus improving device performance. It helps to increase interfacial adhesion (&#8220;wetting&#8221;): fewer voids are observed at the Spiro/perovskite interface if thiols are applied. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating interfacial thiol treatment maintain over 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300&#160;h of 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress.

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of a Large Area of the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mucoadhesive microgel (Bi&#8208;GLUE) integrating high mucoadhesion and flowability is developed as a novel gastrointestinal (GI) modulation platform, which can cover large&#8208;area GI tracts through oral administration. The contrast&#8208;loaded Bi&#8208;GLUE achieves multimodal, large&#8208;area GI imaging that traditional contrasts cannot fulfill. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;GLUE offers a new GI&#8208;radioprotection strategy by constructing an intracorporal radiation&#8208;attenuating shield in the GI lumen.








Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrain the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. High mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, a bismuth&#8211;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex is screened and engineered into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion, such that it&#160;can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivers contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI&#8208;tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or magnetic resonance &#160;modalities and to facilitate the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG&#8208;N materials developed in this work achieve record&#8208;fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.








Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density.

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation and Activating a Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;Induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the feed ratio of two thiol ligands with different steric hindrances, the conformation of the gold nanocluster is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16, while simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into a membrane&#8208;active antibacterial nanomedicine for the effective treatment of refractory bacterial keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8776;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) affects &#8776;120&#160;000&#8211;190&#160;000 people annually and is a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents; although how the GNC structure and capping ligands control the antibacterial properties remains largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their monoligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by approximately ninefold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Promote Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Embedded in Collagen/Platelet&#8208;Rich Plasma Scaffold and Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and application of an exosome/cell&#8208;loaded COL/PRP scaffold for wound healing are assessed. The scaffold is applied on the dorsum wound of the mouse, wherein it promotes wound healing by reducing the level of inflammation, triggering proliferation of cells embedded in the scaffold, and promoting angiogenesis.








Abstract
Engineered skin substitutes derived from human skin significantly reduce inflammatory reactions mediated by foreign/artificial materials and are consequently easier to use for clinical application. Type I collagen is a main component of the extracellular matrix during wound healing and has excellent biocompatibility, and platelet&#8208;rich plasma can be used as the initiator of the healing cascade. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are crucial for tissue repair and play key roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and remodeling extracellular matrix. Herein, Type I collagen and platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which provide natural supports for keratinocyte and fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation, are mixed to form a stable 3D scaffold. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are added to the scaffold to improve the performance of the engineered skin. The physicochemical properties of this cellular scaffold are analyzed, and the repair effect is evaluated in a full&#8208;thickness skin defect mouse model. The cellular scaffold reduces the level of inflammation and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing. Proteomic analysis shows that exosomes exhibit excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory and proangiogenic effects in collagen/platelet&#8208;rich plasma scaffolds. The proposed method provides a new therapeutic strategy and theoretical basis for tissue regeneration and wound repair.

         <title>Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Carbon Dots for Solvent&#8208;Free Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of solvent&#8208;free direct ink writing (DIW) of carbon dots is demonstrated via liquid crystallization, giving rise to highly luminescent fluorescent patterns in three primary colors of blue, green, and red, respectively, due to the significantly limited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect, and promising technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low&#8208;temperature (&lt;50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that DIW with the LC inks dramatically outperforms DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of the LC processing. The approach reported herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

         <title>Enhanced Multiwavelength Response of Flexible Synaptic Transistors for Human Sunburned Skin Simulation and Neuromorphic Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic synaptic transistors with enhanced multiwavelength light&#8208;response properties are prepared by introducing alumina oxide (AlOX ) nanoparticles. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, a learning efficiency model, neural network computing, and &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning memory functions are successfully simulated.








Abstract
In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single&#8208;wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device&#8208;level.

   &lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device-level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Li&#8208;Ion Conduction in Oxides Enabling Anomalously Stable Charge Transport across the Li/Electrolyte Interface in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is unveiled, which features a low activation energy (0.2 eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on interstitial sites, caused by the Li&#8211;O polyhedra distortion and the Li&#8208;ion correlation. High Li&#8208;ion conductivities (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C) and anomalously stable charge transport across Li/LiTa2PO8 without interfacial modifications are thereby induced.








Abstract
The softness of sulfur sublattice and rotational PS4 tetrahedra in thiophosphates result in liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction, leading to enhanced ionic conductivities and stable electrode/thiophosphate interfacial ionic transport. However, the existence of liquid&#8208;like ionic conduction in rigid oxides remains unclear, and modifications are deemed necessary to achieve stable Li/oxide solid electrolyte interfacial charge transport. In this study, by combining the neutron diffraction survey, geometrical analysis, bond valence site energy analysis, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulation, 1D liquid&#8208;like Li&#8208;ion conduction is discovered in LiTa2PO8 and its derivatives, wherein Li&#8208;ion migration channels are connected by four&#8208; or five&#8208;fold oxygen&#8208;coordinated interstitial sites. This conduction features a low activation energy (0.2&#160;eV) and short mean residence time (&lt;1&#160;ps) of Li ions on the interstitial sites, originating from the Li&#8211;O polyhedral distortion and Li&#8208;ion correlation, which are controlled by doping strategies. The liquid&#8208;like conduction enables a high ionic conductivity (1.2&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C), and a 700&#160;h anomalously stable cycling under 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for Li/LiTa2PO8/Li cells without interfacial modifications. These findings provide principles for the future discovery and design of improved solid electrolytes that do not require modifications to the Li/solid electrolyte interface to achieve stable ionic transport.

Natural light enabling spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40 alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully. It can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the spin wave is modulated stably, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior








Abstract
Spin waves are considered to be an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enablings spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40&#8208;alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) by sunlight can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers for the flexible deep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge&#8208;transport behavior. Stable deep&#8208;blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual&#8208;Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage&#8208;controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high&#8208;performance multifunctional photodetectors.








Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm.

     alt="3D-Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro-Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual-Mode"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage-controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high-performance multifunctional photodetectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro-sized single crystals. Because the single-crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer-embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built-in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow-band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;Blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;blinking luminescence from charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is observed. This is attributed to the singly charged trion maintaining photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the different energy levels in the GQDs caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups.








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behavior from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bioimaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photocharging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which is observed in photocharged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. These results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non&#8208;volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating for long&#8208;term biointerfacing: Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes is fabricated through the engineering of nanocrystalline domains at the interface, enabling long&#8208;term electrocardiogram recording and electrical pacing without failure.








Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings is hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. This study reports a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. It demonstrates the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. This study findings highlight the potential of its approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tough hydrovoltaic coating with a strong structural binding effect is developed for the simultaneous achievement of good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage &#8776;3.18 V) and highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing ability. Based on skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures, wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat is demonstrated.








Abstract
The lack of a strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of the evaporation&#8208;driven hydrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It is a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hydrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, a flexible tough polyacrylonitrile/alumina (PAN/Al2O3) hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage, Voc&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V&#160;M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;m) capabilities is developed. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 strong water&#8208;flow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures are proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of the evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

A three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction, and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction, and the [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF shows excellent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and natural&#8208;sunlight&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites is synthesized; then, ionic liquids (ILs) are loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reaches 126.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in the Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in an Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy is developed by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism and it shows an exceptionally high permeability up to 36&#160;000 at high frequency of 100 kHz. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to its low anisotropy and unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields in the nanocrystalline alloy.








Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here, a promising nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent is reported, which is producible under industrial conditions, and which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36&#160;000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25&#160;000&#160;&#177;&#160;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from the traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping nonmagnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms locally promotes the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of the nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Regulating the Lithium Ions&#8217; Local Coordination Environment through Designing a COF with Single Atomic Co Site to Achieve Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

Synergistic effects of Co&#9472;N coordination and a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior.








Abstract
The detrimental growth of lithium dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) is explored as an artificial SEI on the surface of the Li&#8208;metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to the&#160;COF. The synergistic effects of the Co&#9472;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior. Furthermore, in situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li&#8208;nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

Following oral administration in mice, &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticles (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) target and transpass intestinal M cells, overcome the epithelial barrier, and undergo phagocytosis by macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; pass through the lymphatic system, enter systemic circulation, and then spontaneously target a primary tumor and metastatic lesions, functioning like &#8220;precision&#8208;guided stealth missiles&#8221;, improving the effectiveness of antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The prognosis in cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with current treatment modalities is poor owing to the highly desmoplastic tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a &#946;&#8208;glucans&#8208;functionalized zinc&#8211;doxorubicin nanoparticle system (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs) that can be orally administered, is developed for targeted PDAC therapy. Following oral administration in PDAC&#8208;bearing mice, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs actively target/transpass microfold cells, overcome the intestinal epithelial barrier, and then undergo subsequent phagocytosis by endogenous macrophages (&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;). As hitchhiking cellular vehicles, &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981; transits through the intestinal lymphatic system and enters systemic circulation, ultimately accumulating in the tumor tissue as a result of the tumor&#8208;homing and &#8220;stealth&#8221; properties that are conferred by endogenous M&#981;. Meanwhile, the M&#981; that hitchhikes&#160;&#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD NPs&#160;is activated to produce matrix metalloproteinases, destroying the desmoplastic stromal barrier, and differentiates toward the M1&#8208;like phenotype, modulating the TME and recruiting effector T cells, ultimately inducing apoptosis of the tumor cells. The combination of &#946;Glus&#8208;ZnD@M&#981;&#160;and immune checkpoint blockade effectively inhibits the growth of the primary tumor and suppresses the development of metastasis. It thus represents an appealing approach to targeted PDAC therapy.

         <title>Tailoring the Weight of Surface and Intralayer Edge States to Control LUMO Energies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rolling transfer of Langmuir layers of amphiphilic C60 derivatives is shown to enable the production of films with highly defined morphology. The resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies enable the establishment of a practical model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor. This allows prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.








Abstract
The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the optoelectronic properties in organic films, which are crucial for their application, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here,&#160;an automated method is presented for fabricating thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extension of domain edges, both of which are used to control nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer&#8208;type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during the deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Using UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that the rtLL method advances the deposition of multi&#8208;Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with defined morphology. The variation in nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions is thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square&#8208;wave voltammetry) enable the establishment of a model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for the prediction of the range of accessible LUMO energies.

         <title>Soft&#8211;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure is proposed and realized in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is confirmed by electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. The synergy of heterostructure and functional cation vacancies can effectively lower the mechanical stress, decrease Na+&#8208;diffusion barriers and maintain structural stability, resulting in high rate capacity and remarkable cycling performance.








Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acting as the dominant active component and resisting structural deformation during charge&#8211;discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+&#8208;transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium&#8208;storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts: the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diode&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al2O3/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short&#8208;circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s.








Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm2, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Restraining Interfacial Cu2+ by using Amorphous SnO2 as Sacrificial Protection Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy is proposed to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction to formate. The high active interface can significantly lower the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) of the carbon dioxide reduction and enhance its selectivity and activity for formate. 








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate is of great interest in the field of electrochemical energy. Cu&#8208;based material is an appealing electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. However, retaining Cu2+ under the high cathodic potential of CO2RR remains a great challenge, leading to low electrocatalytic selectivity, activity, and stability. Herein, inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 (c&#8208;CuO/a&#8208;SnO2) is reported, which greatly boosts the electrocatalytic sensitivity, activity, and stability for CO2RR to formate. The as&#8208;made hybrid catalyst can achieve superior high selectivity for CO2RR to formate with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.7%, and a superhigh current density of over 1 A cm&#8722;2 that far outperforms industrial benchmarks (FE &gt; 90%, current density &gt; 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray diffractionexperimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the broadened s&#8208;orbital in interfacial a&#8208;SnO2 offers the lower orbital for extra electrons than Cu2+, which can effectively retain nearby Cu2+, and the high active interface significantly lowers the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) and enhances the selectivity and activity for CO2RR to formate.

In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffractionexperimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the broadened s-orbital in interfacial a-SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; offers the lower orbital for extra electrons than Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which can effectively retain nearby Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and the high active interface significantly lowers the energy barrier of the limited step (&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8594; &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;HCOO) and enhances the selectivity and activity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR to formate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;mW</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous power supply device utilizing second near&#8208;infrared light is proposed with the synergistic combination of photovoltaic cells and a thermoelectric generator. Skin thermal management is used to turn photothermal toxicity into a favorable factor for photoelectric conversion. In in vivo experiment, its output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%.








Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skin relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion photothermal effect. Here, skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, that is, clinical pacemakers (6&#8211;200&#160;&#181;W), drug pumps (0.5&#8211;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8211;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8776;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Folding Double&#8208;Stranded DNA into Designed Shapes with Triplex&#8208;Forming Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;stranded DNA is cooperatively compacted into designed shapes by triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides, which bridge multiple normal or reverse Hoogsteen recognition domains. Hoogsteen&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly is highly programmable, methodologically straightforward, and yields large uniquely addressable nanostructures at low&#8208;cost. Moreover, the presented &#8220;triplex origami&#8221; method enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates not achievable by other artificial methodologies.








Abstract
The compaction and organization of genomic DNA is a central mechanism in eukaryotic cells, but engineered architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) is notably challenging. Here, long dsDNA templates are folded into designed shapes via triplex&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly. Triplex&#8208;forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) bind purines in dsDNA via normal or reverse Hoogsteen interactions. In the triplex origami methodology, these non&#8208;canonical interactions are programmed to compact dsDNA (linear or plasmid) into well&#8208;defined objects, which demonstrate a variety of structural features: hollow and raster&#8208;filled, single&#8208; and multi&#8208;layered, with custom curvatures and geometries, and featuring lattice&#8208;free, square&#8208;, or honeycomb&#8208;pleated internal arrangements. Surprisingly, the length of integrated and free&#8208;standing dsDNA loops can be modulated with near&#8208;perfect efficiency; from hundreds down to only six bp (2&#160;nm). The inherent rigidity of dsDNA promotes structural robustness and non&#8208;periodic structures of almost 25.000&#160;nt are therefore formed with fewer unique starting materials, compared to other DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly methods. Densely triplexed structures also resist degradation by DNase I. Triplex&#8208;mediated dsDNA folding is methodologically straightforward and orthogonal to Watson&#8208;Crick&#8208;based methods. Moreover, it enables unprecedented spatial control over dsDNA templates.

         <title>Conversion of Dielectric Surface Effect into Volume Effect for High Output Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conversion of the dielectric surface effect into a volume effect is proposed for a high output energy of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). In this work, the physics mechanism of thick dielectric films used in TENGs is identified and a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs is provided.








Abstract
Improving the output energy and durability of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) remains a considerable challenge for their practical applications. Owing to the interface effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction, thinner films with higher dielectric constants yield a higher output; however, they are not durable for practical applications. Herein, the dielectric surface effect is changed into a volume effect by adopting a millimeter&#8208;thick dielectric film with an inner porous network structure so that charges can hop in the surface state of the network. Charge migration inside the dielectric film is the key factor affecting the output of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#160;with a thick film, based on which each working stage follows the energy&#8208;maximization principle in the voltage&#8211;charge plot. The maximum peak and average power densities of the TENG with polyurethane foam film in 1&#160;mm thickness reach 40.9 and 20.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;Hz&#8722;1, respectively, under environmental conditions, and the output charge density is 5.14&#160;times that of TENGs with a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) film of the same thickness. Superdurability is achieved in the rotary&#8208;mode TENG&#160;after 200&#160;000 operation cycles. This study identifies the physical mechanism of the thick dielectric film used in TENGs and provides a new approach to promote the output and durability of TENGs.

         <title>Porous, Ultrathin PtAgBiTe Nanosheets for Direct Hydrazine Hydrate Fuel Cell Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous, ultrathin PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets with widths beyond 700 nm are synthesized via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route, and are employed as anode electrocatalysts for hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction and actual direct hydrazine hydrate fuel cells. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets in actual hydrazine&#8211;O2/air fuel cell devices are 532.9/315.9 mW cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D&#160;nanomaterials have attracted extensive attention due to their fascinating applications in sustainable and clean&#8208;energy&#8208;related devices, but obtaining ultrathin 2D multimetallic polycrystalline structures with large lateral dimensions remains a challenge. In this study, ultrathin 2D porous PtAgBiTe and PtBiTe polycrystalline nanosheets (PNSs) are obtained via a visible&#8208;light&#8208;photoinduced Bi2Te3&#8208;nanosheet&#8208;mediated route. The PtAgBiTe PNSs are assembled by sub&#8208;5&#160;nm grains with widths beyond 700&#160;nm. Strain and ligand effects originating from the porous, curly polycrystalline structure endow the PtAgBiTe PNSs with robust hydrazine hydrate oxidation reaction activity. Theoretical research demonstrates that the modified Pt activates the N&#8211;H bonds in N2H4 during the reaction, and strong hybridization between Pt&#8208;5d and N&#8208;2p facilitates dehydrogenation while reducing energy consumption. The peak power densities of the PtAgBiTe PNSs in actual hydrazine&#8208;O2/air fuel cell devices are boosted to 532.9/315.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, while those of the commercial Pt/C are 394.7/157.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This work provides a strategy not only for preparing ultrathin multimetallic PNSs but also for finding promising electrocatalysts for actual hydrazine fuel cells.

         <title>Implantable, Biodegradable, and Wireless Triboelectric Devices for Cancer Therapy through Disrupting Microtubule and Actins Dynamics</title>

An implantable, biodegradable, and wireless triboelectric device is developed for cancer therapy. The significantly enhanced tumor therapeutic effects against a broad&#8208;spectrum of tumors through cell and animal experiments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Electric&#8208;field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, an improved and alternative method is proposed for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable, and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence and Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multimode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure, and Temperature in Fibers and 3D&#8208;Printed Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a multifunctional sensing platform in the form of photo&#8208;/mechano&#8208;luminescent powder, fibers, and 3D&#8208;printed polymers for optical detection of pressure, temperature, force, and friction is reported. The combination of 3D&#8208;printing with fiber spinning demonstrates the possibility of mass production of mechanoluminescence&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.








Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, that is, exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform is built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles are embedded in micrometer&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. Individually modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation, such as impact and friction, are also fabricated. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8776;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8776;6.20&#160;nm&#160;GPa&#8722;1. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208;band spectral shifts, emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening, and lifetime shortening. This work supports the possibility of mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

         <title>Unlocking High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Activation of In&#8208;Layer Channels for Enhanced Ion Storage and Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes an electrochemical phase transformation approach for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) for ammonium&#8208;ion batteries. The in&#8208;layer channels provide additional NH4+ storage sites and rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. The E&#8208;VOPO shows exceptional NH4+ storage performance with increased capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability. The resulting full cell operates stably for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion batteries, leveraging non&#8208;metallic ammonium ions, have arisen as a promising electrochemical energy storage system; however, their advancement has been hindered by the scarcity of high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage materials. In this study, an electrochemical phase transformation approach is proposed for the in situ synthesis of layered VOPO4&#183;2H2O (E&#8208;VOPO) with predominant growth on the (200) plane, corresponding to the tetragonal channels on the (001) layers. The findings reveal that these tetragonal in&#8208;layer channels not only furnish NH4+ storage sites but also enhance transfer kinetics by providing rapid cross&#8208;layer migration pathways. This crucial aspect has been largely overlooked in previous studies. The E&#8208;VOPO electrode exhibits exceptional ammonium&#8208;ion storage performance, including significantly increased specific capacity, enhanced rate capability, and robust cycling stability. The resulting full cell can be stably operated for 12&#160;500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1 for over 70 days. The proposed approach offers a new strategy for meticulously engineering electrode materials with facilitated ion storage and migration, thereby paving the way for developing more efficient and sustainable energy storage systems.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) is fabricated, which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides.








Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. In this work, a series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstatebased foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) are fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44&#160;wt%), which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44&#160;wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8776;14.4&#160;g in a batch experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 may inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

DNA Nanotechnology
DNA nanotechnology, so far, has almost exclusively relied on Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing. In article number 2302497, Minke A. D. Nijenhuis, Kurt V. Gothelf, and co&#8208;workers introduce a triplex origami methodology. They demonstrate that triplex DNA, formed by Hoogsteen interactions, also possesses remarkable potential for nanoscale engineering. Triplex origami enables unprecedented large&#8208;scale architectural control over double&#8208;stranded DNA templates, folding and compacting them into sheets, bundles, and even custom potted flower shapes.

Tissue Regeneration
In article number 2300180, Hao Chen, Wenguo Cui, Yuhui Zhang, and co&#8208;workers propose a hydrogel&#8208;microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with cell recruiting and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction. The microsphere niche guides the fate of endogenous stem cells in the aberrant mechanical microenvironment, offering an effective strategy for enhancing the endogenous regeneration of degenerated tissues.

Polar Oxide Surfaces
In article number 2303051, Jaekwang Lee, Sang Ho Oh, and co&#8208;workers discover a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces using in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with atomic simulation. The dynamic motion of atomic steps, activated at a high temperature, converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via a step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.

Superconducting Diode Effect
Magnetization control of the superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. In article number 2304083, Hideki Narita, Teruo Ono, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices.

In article number 2301347, Le Duc Anh, Iwao Matsuda, Masaaki Tanaka, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the first sub&#8208;picosecond (&#8776;600 fs) magnetization process in a ferromagnetic quantum well, which utilizes the high carrier coherency and a rapid photo&#8208;Demba field effect, using pump&#8208;and&#8208;probe measurements with an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser. This could open a new way to ultrafast magnetic storage and information.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular materials catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), that feature permanent porosity as a design feature, are showcased. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.








Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, 2D and 3D platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesting: Materials, Components, Systems, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Redox Bicatalysis Batteries for Energy Storage and Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review article, the fundamentals and design principles of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery (constructed by redox bifunctional catalyst cathode and metal anode) are summarized and proposed, and the effects of device structure and compositions are deeply discussed for energy storage and chemical production, which provides a design paradigm for new types of energy storage and conversion devices.








Abstract
New types of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices based on redox electrocatalytic reactions possess great potential in renewable energy to maximize energy utilization and balance environmental issues. The typical device is the metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis battery, where the cathode is redox bifunctional catalyst&#160;(named as redox bicatalyst) with gas, solid, liquid as active reactants while anode is metal, driven by cathodic redox electrocatalytic reactions during charge/discharge processes, which promotes the energy storage and chemical production. In this system, the metal anode, redox&#8208;bicatalyst cathode, electrolytes, and the redox electrochemical reactions can be modified and adjusted to achieve the optimal energy conversion and utilization. Therefore, the deep understanding of the electrochemical system is conducive to designing new devices to meet the demand among various applications, including energy storage and conversion. In this review, the authors clarify the fundamentals and design principles of the rechargeable/reversible metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries and how each part affects the devices in energy conversion and chemical production. The authors summarize the electrocatalytic reduction/oxidation reactions, the reported systems relied on redox reactions, and the corresponding redox bicatalysts. Finally, a perspective of the key challenges and the possible new types of metal&#8208;redox bicatalysis batteries for efficient energy utilization and chemical production are given.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Meet Polymers: From Synthesis Strategies to Healthcare Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybridizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with flexible polymers leads to unique properties wherein the incorporation of suitable polymers enhances the MOF performance. This review highlights the recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials, and discusses their applications in anticancer therapy, anti&#8208;bacteria treatment, imaging, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Insights from the current research and design principles are revealed for addressing future challenges.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been at the forefront of nanotechnological research for the past decade owing to their high porosity, high surface area, diverse configurations, and controllable chemical structures. They are a rapidly developing class of nanomaterials that are predominantly applied in batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, sensors, drug delivery, gas separation, adsorption, and storage. However, the limited functions and unsatisfactory performance of MOFs resulting from their low chemical and mechanical stability hamper further development. Hybridizing MOFs with polymers is an excellent solution to these problems, because polymers&#8212;which are soft, flexible, malleable, and processable&#8212;can induce unique properties in the hybrids based on those of the two disparate components while retaining their individuality. This review highlights recent advances in the preparation of MOF&#8211;polymer nanomaterials. Furthermore, several applications wherein the incorporation of polymers enhances the MOF performance are discussed, such as anticancer therapy, bacterial elimination, imaging, therapeutics, protection from oxidative stress and inflammation, and environmental remediation. Finally, insights from the focus of existing research and design principles for mitigating future challenges are presented.

         <title>Catalyst Development for High&#8208;Temperature Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (HT&#8208;PEMFC) Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 40, October 5, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review outlines catalyst advancements for high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte fuel
cells operating at elevated temperatures (160&#8208;180 &#176;C). These cells utilize reformate/air gasses and employ phosphoric acid within the polybenzimidazole polymer matrix as a proton&#8208;conducting medium. Catalysts employed are platinum or platinum&#8208;alloyed nanoparticles immobilized on a carbon support.








Abstract
A constant increase in global emission standard is causing fuel cell (FC) technology to gain importance. Over the last two decades, a great deal of research has been focused on developing more active catalysts to boost the performance of high&#8208;temperature polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFC), as well as their durability. Due to material degradation at high&#8208;temperature conditions, catalyst design becomes challenging. Two main approaches are suggested: (i) alloying platinum (Pt) with low&#8208;cost transition metals to reduce Pt usage, and (ii) developing novel catalyst support that anchor metal particles more efficiently while inhibiting corrosion phenomena. In this comprehensive review, the most recent platinum group metal (PGM) and platinum group metal free (PGM&#8208;free) catalyst development is detailed, as well as the development of alternative carbon (C) supports for HT&#8208;PEMFCs.
