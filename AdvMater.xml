         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) were mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, was selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (&#945;PD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and compared with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (&#945;PD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirmed significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and the early diagnosis of these diseases by quantification of ROS is critical for the curable treatment of patients. Here, a novel probe was developed based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescence molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs showed intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390&#160;nm and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence signal of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm was quenched by MoSe2 NPs. With the presence of ROS, the novel probe reacted with ROS and then oxidated rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of Cy3 fluorescence signals. With the help of ROS&#8208;related CD and fluorescent dual&#8208;mode signals, the limit of detection (LOD) of CD signals and fluorescence signals in living cells was 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments was attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs was able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by fluorescence signals. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as potential biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Microenvironmentally responsive chemotherapeutic prodrugs and CHEK2 inhibitors self&#8208;assembled micelles: protecting fertility and enhancing chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, we developed the co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP), which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions. (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8208;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, we propose a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution and define it as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) are selected as sonocatalysts and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, Pt nanoparticles help to capture sono&#8208;excited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH) as natural hole sacrificial agents can consume sono&#8208;excited holes, which greatly improves charge separation efficiency and promote the controllable and sustainable H2 generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3 nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2 under US irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2 and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia, thus synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue&#8208;Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real&#8208;Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Induced Cardiotoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, three&#8208;dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, we firstly introduce a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue&#8208;sensor platform, composed of a bi&#8208;pillar&#8208;grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT. Two pillars were three&#8208;dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge&#8208;embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self&#8208;assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi&#8208;channel electronic system allowed for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue&#8208;sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants. In summary, we expect biohybrid 3D printing technology to be a potential fabrication method to provide a next&#8208;generation tissue&#8208;sensor platform for an effective drug development process.

Abstract
Effective repolarization of macrophages has emerged as a promising approach for anti&#8208;cancer therapy. However, there are very few studies on the effect of reprogramming macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype without reconversion while maintaining an activated M1 phenotype. Moreover, these immunomodulatory methods have serious drawbacks due to the activation of normal monocytic cells. Therefore, it remains a challenge to selectively reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) without systemic toxicities. Here, 
X&#8208;ray guided and triggered remote 
control of a 
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (X&#8208;CC9) that exclusively activates therapeutic agents at tumor sites was established. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, X&#8208;CC9 selectively enhanced M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 repolarization within the tumor microenvironment, and significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy with robust immune responses in two animal models. This strategy provides an ideal method for improving the safety of the macrophage polarization and may constitute a promising immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams Through Template&#8208;Coating pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density, small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables inheritance of the structure, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8764;80% dimension retention; &#8764;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8764;0.13 GPa g&#8722;1cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8208;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multi&#8208;stacked Li&#8208;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8764;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), N/P (2.3) ratios, and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC was designed by manipulating their local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8208;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8208;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs, promoted the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8208;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8208;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8208;SO2/&#8208;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-energy and long cycle lithium-sulfur (Li-S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single-atom catalysts (SACs) are reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; multi-stacked Li-S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8764;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), N/P (2.3) ratios, and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The high-activity Fe SAC was designed by manipulating their local environments using electron-exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene-like-S (-S) and oxidized-S (-SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), adjacent to Fe SACs, promoted the kinetics of the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The -S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas -SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital energy level can be modulated by the different -SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/-S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel with Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8208;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggered inflammatory stress response after in&#8208;vivo implantation. Herein, we reported a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibited excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8208;mechanical&#8208;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation and improving its biosafety as an implanted device and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, it is for the first time to demonstrate this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials Biological Effects Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. Herein, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green (ICG) for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface grafted cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;guaranteed high carrier mobility in quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectric semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, we propose a route based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8210;1 S&#8210;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8764;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. Our work uncovers the relation between electron&#8208;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next-generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi-2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, we propose a route based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi-2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron-phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out-of-plane vibrational vectors.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>

Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials could benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunication, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by fast nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation under high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here we resolve some of these challenges and demonstration optically excited lasing from a fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of compact, continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8208;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Herein a hydrogen processing strategy has been developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability towards electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictated the effective reconstruction of LaNi5 surface into porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active site exposure, and adsorption energy towards the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam was reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibited remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media.

         <title>Picoperovskites: the Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed Within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionising the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light emitting diodes and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. We report four isolated sub&#8208;nm, or pico&#8208;scale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8764;1.2&#8208;1.6&#160;nm single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8764;1.4&#160;nm diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8764;1.2&#160;nm diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures 1/4 an ABX3 unit cell in cross&#8208;section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating band gap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Precisely Constructed Metal Sulfides with Localized Single&#8208;Atom Rhodium for Photocatalytic C&#8722;H Activation and Direct Methanol Coupling to Ethylene Glycol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photocatalyst composed of alternately lined wurtzite and zinc&#8208;blende segments in one dimension and single&#8208;atom Rh selectively located on the wurtzite segment demonstrates record&#8208;breaking performances for the selective conversion of methanol to ethylene glycol via preferential C&#8722;H activation. The regularly lined heterojunctions facilitate the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers, and the single&#8208;atom Rh catalyzes methanol adsorption and activation.








Abstract
Although there are many studies on photocatalytic environmental remediation, hydrogen evolution, and chemical transformations, less success has been achieved for the synthesis of industrially important and largely demanded bulk chemicals using semiconductor photocatalysis, which holds great potential to drive unique chemical reactions that are difficult to implement by the conventional heterogeneous catalysis. The performance of semiconductors used for photochemical synthesis is, however, usually unsatisfactory due to limited efficiencies in light harvesting, charge&#8208;carrier separation, and surface reactions. The precise construction of heterogeneous photocatalysts to facilitate these processes is an attractive but challenging goal. Here, single&#8208;atom rhodium&#8208;doped metal sulfide nanorods composed of alternately stacked wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende segments are successfully designed and fabricated, which demonstrate record&#8208;breaking efficiencies for visible light&#8208;driven preferential activation of C&#8722;H bond in methanol to form ethylene glycol (EG), a key bulk chemical used for the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer. The wurtzite/zinc&#8208;blende heterojunctions lined regularly in one dimension accelerate the charge&#8208;carrier separation and migration. Single&#8208;atom rhodium selectively deposited onto the wurtzite segment with photogenerated holes accumulated facilitates methanol adsorption and C&#8722;H activation. The present work paves the way to harnessing photocatalysis for bulk chemical synthesis with structure&#8208;defined semiconductors.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Syngas Evolution with Molecular Catalyst Metal&#8208;organic Framework Nanozymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly active, durable, and selective catalysts for light&#8208;driven CO2 and water conversion to value&#8208;adding products are key toward a sustainable energy cycle. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one material is showcased, consisting of a metal&#8208;organic framework co&#8208;hosting two molecular catalysts. This assembly (nanozyme) harvests light, funnels energy to molecular sites, and enhances charge separation, thereby unlocking high photon efficiencies and adjustable syngas evolution.








Abstract
Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a high&#8208;priority intermediate for producing several commodity chemicals, e.g., ammonia, methanol, and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Accordingly, parallel sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and protons to syngas is a key step toward a sustainable energy cycle. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems and materials often fall short as application&#8208;oriented concurrent CO and H2 evolution requires challenging reaction conditions which can hamper stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Here a light&#8208;harvesting metal&#8208;organic framework hosting two molecular catalysts is engineered to yield colloidal, water&#8208;stable, versatile nanoreactors for photocatalytic syngas generation with highly controllable product ratios. In&#8208;depth fluorescence, X&#8208;ray, and microscopic studies paired with kinetic analysis show that the host delivers energy efficiently to active sites, conceptually yielding nanozymes. This unlocked sustained CO2 reduction and H2 evolution with benchmark turnover numbers and record incident photon conversions up to 36%, showcasing a highly active and durable all&#8208;in&#8208;one material toward application in solar energy&#8208;driven syngas generation.

         <title>Liesegang Phenomenon of Liquid Metals on Au Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomena and mechanisms for achieving Liesegang patterns of spatially recurrent crystallization through gallium (Ga)&#8208;based liquid metal clusters dabbed onto the gold (Au) film have been disclosed. During the reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading process of Ga&#8208;based liquid metal clusters on Au film, the chemical reactions occur simultaneously, accompanied by the crystallization of intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2.








Abstract
Room temperature liquid metals (LM) such as gallium (Ga) own the potential to react with specific materials which would incubate new application categories. Here, diverse self&#8208;organized ring patterns due to nonequilibrium reaction&#8208;diffusion and spreading&#8208;limitation of Ga&#8208;based LM clusters on gold (Au) film are reported, among which diffusion is the controlling step and the self&#8208;limiting oxide layer plays the role of kinetic barrier. Such phenomena, classically known as the Liesegang rings, mainly occur in electrolyte media. Unlike existing systems, the present periodic crystallization mechanism enables highly symmetric spatiotemporal periodic Liesegang rings on a smaller scale under ambient conditions. Typically, the Ga&#8208;Au and eutectic gallium&#8208;indium alloy (EGaIn)&#8208;Au reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;spreading systems are constructed, obtaining the revert type and hybrid type concentric Liesegang patterns, respectively. The competitive patterning behavior of the intermediate phase products AuGa2 and AuIn2 in hybrid Liesegang patterns is further analyzed by altering the initial Ga/In mass ratio, first&#8208;principles calculations, and molecular dynamic simulations. When the mass ratio of In in GaIn alloy exceeds 15%, it will preferentially react with Au. The discovery of LM Liesegang phenomenon is expected to be a flashpoint for self&#8208;organized reaction&#8208;diffusion systems and offers promising rules for diverse areas such as materials synthesis and the jewelry design industry.

         <title>Super&#8208;Assembled Multi&#8208;Level Asymmetric Mesochannels for Coupled Accelerated Dual&#8208;Ion Selective Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/AAO/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) with dual&#8208;ion selective layers is constructed by super&#8208;assembly strategy. The special structure endows it with gating, storing and releasing performance. Importantly, the couple of MC and MS in MC/AAO/MS nanochannels endow it with enhanced cation selectivity and osmotic energy conversion performance.








Abstract
Asymmetric nanofluidic devices hold great potential in energy conversion applications. However, most of the existing asymmetric nanofluidic devices remain a single&#8208;level asymmetric structure and a single&#8208;ion selective layer, which results in weak ion selectivity and limited energy conversion efficiency. Herein, a multi&#8208;level asymmetric mesoporous carbon/anodized aluminum/mesoporous silica (MC/AAO/MS) nanofluidic device with abundant and ordered mesochannels is constructed from super&#8208;assembly strategy. The resultant MC/AAO/MS exhibits diode&#8208;like ion transport and outstanding ion storage&#8208;release performance. Importantly, MC/AAO/MS couples the MC and MS dual&#8208;ion selective layers, which ensures a high ionic conductance and evidently enhances the cation selectivity. Thereby, the MC/AAO/MS demonstrates ascendant salinity gradient energy conversion performance. The power density and conversion efficiency can reach up to 5.37&#160;W m&#8722;2 and 32.79%, respectively. Noteworthy, a good energy conversion performance of 63&#160;mW m&#8722;2 can still be achieved upon high working area, outperforming 300% of the performance of MC/AAO and MS/AAO single&#8208;level asymmetric nanochannels. Theoretical calculation further verifies that the multi&#8208;level asymmetric structure and dual&#8208;ion selective transport are the reason for the enhanced cation selectivity and energy conversion efficiency. This work opens a new avenue for constructing multi&#8208;level asymmetric structured nanofluidic devices for various applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Solution&#8208;Processed 2D P&#8208;Type WSe2 Transistors and Circuits through Molecular Doping</title>

         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type WSe2 thin&#8208;film transistor is successfully fabricated by Br2&#8208;doping with a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;107. The resulting complementary inverters with patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films reaches an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V.








Abstract
Semiconducting ink based on 2D single&#8208;crystal flakes with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces enables the implementation of high&#8208;performance devices on form&#8208;free substrates by cost&#8208;effective and scalable printing processes. However, the lack of solution&#8208;processed p&#8208;type 2D semiconducting inks with high mobility is an obstacle to the development of complementary integrated circuits. Here, a versatile strategy of doping with Br2 is reported to enhance the hole mobility by orders of magnitude for p&#8208;type transistors with 2D layered materials. Br2&#8208;doped WSe2 transistors show a field&#8208;effect hole mobility of more than 27&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, and a high on/off current ratio of &#8776;107, and exhibits excellent operational stability during the on&#8208;off switching, cycling, and bias stressing testing. Moreover, complementary inverters composed of patterned p&#8208;type WSe2 and n&#8208;type MoS2 layered films are demonstrated with an ultra&#8208;high gain of 1280 under a driving voltage (VDD) of 7&#160;V. This work unveils the high potential of solution&#8208;processed 2D semiconductors with low&#8208;temperature processability for flexible devices and monolithic circuitry.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral polymer micelles are prepared by complexing antigens with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. D&#8208;chiral micelles present the lowest cytotoxicity while promoting the highest activation levels of dendritic cells and antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells compared to those of L&#8208;chiral and achiral micelles. Immunoactivation mediated by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life processes, and even the pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid&#8208;modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promoting the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes, and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation are demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>Energy and Space Efficient Parallel Adder Using Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest functional crossbars incorporating molecular materials to date are fabricated, in which all the memristors are consistent, robust, and reliable. An 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders are experimentally demonstrated. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit adder with 268&#160;million inputs is simulated that outperformed a multicore complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) platform.








Abstract
A breakthrough in in&#8208;memory computing technologies hinges on the development of appropriate material platforms that can overcome their existing limitations, such as larger than optimal footprint and multiple serial computational steps, with potential accumulation of errors. Using a molecular switching element with multiple non&#8208;monotonic and deterministic transitions, the device count and the number of computational steps can be substantially reduced. With molecular materials, however, the realization of a reliable and robust platform is&#160;an unattained goal for decades. Here, crossbar arrays with up to 64 molecular memristors are fabricated to experimentally demonstrate 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders&#160;that operate for thousands of measurement cycles with an estimated error probability of 10&#8722;16. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit parallel adder is designed and simulated with 268&#160;million inputs including contributions from the peripheral circuitry showing a 47&#215; higher energy efficiency, 93&#215; faster operation, and 9% of the footprint, leading to 4390 times improved energy&#8211;delay product compared to a special purpose complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based multicore adder.

         <title>Highly Efficient Flexocatalysis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexocatalysis in 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors is demonstrated for the first time via dynamic flexoelectric polarization, largely expanding the polarization&#8208;based mechanocatalysis from non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials into 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors. The flexocatalysis shows the distinguished performance comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezocatalysis, with excellent stability and reproducibility. It opens the field of flexoelectric effect&#8208;based mechanochemistry in 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors.








Abstract
Catalysis is vitally important for chemical engineering, energy, and environment. It is critical to discover new mechanisms for efficient catalysis. For piezoelectric/pyroelectric/ferroelectric materials that have a non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, interfacial polarization&#8208;induced redox reactions at surfaces leads to advanced mechanocatalysis. Here, the first flexocatalysis for 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors, such as MnO2&#160;nanosheets, is demonstrated largely expanding the polarization&#8208;based&#8208;mechanocatalysis to 2D centrosymmetric materials. Under ultrasonic excitation, the reactive species are created due to the strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric polarization in MnO2&#160;nanosheets composed nanoflowers. The organic pollutants (Methylene Blue et&#160;al.) can be effectively degraded within 5&#160;min; the performance of the flexocatalysis is comparable to that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art piezocatalysis, with excellent stability and reproducibility. Moreover, the factors related to flexocatalysis such as material morphology, adsorption, mechanical vibration intensity, and temperature are explored, which give deep insights into the mechanocatalysis. This study opens the field of flexoelectric effect&#8208;based mechanochemistry in 2D centrosymmetric semiconductors.

         <title>Local Electric Field Promoted Kinetics and Interfacial Stability of a Phosphorus Anode with Ionic Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cationic covalent organic framework creates a local electric field to regulate the reaction process of phosphorus anode. The local electric field can confine the soluble intermediate lithium polyphosphide species, change the electronic structure of polyphosphide anions to accelerate the reaction kinetics, and induce the generation of stable and tough SEI for long cycling stability.








Abstract
A phosphorus anode is a promising option for energy&#8208;storage applications because of its high theoretical specific capacity and safe lithiation potential. However, the multiphase phosphorus lithiation/delithiation reactions and soluble reaction intermediates cause sluggish reaction kinetics and loss of&#160;active materials. Herein, a novel local electric field (LEF) strategy is proposed to inhibit the intermediates dissolution and promote the reaction kinetics by optimizing ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs). Among them, the LEF induced by the cationic covalent organic framework effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the phosphorus anode. The strong electrostatic interaction between the polyphosphides and cationic covalent organic framework confines the dissolution of active materials and tailors the electronic structure of polyphosphides to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The cationic covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;assisted phosphorus anode provides a high capacity of 1227.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.4 A g&#8722;1 (8.6 C) and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 87% after 500 cycles at 1.3 A g&#8722;1. This work not only broadens the application of iCOFs for phosphorus anode but also inspires the great potential of the local electric field in battery technology.

         <title>A Smart &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; Selectively Blocks Oral Cancer Energy Metabolism through Synergistic Inhibition of Exogenous Nutrient Supply and Endogenous Energy Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart responsive &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; is developed to improve oral cancer metabolic intervention. NanoLock is a pomegranate&#8208;like nanocomplex of cyclicRGD&#8208;modified carboxymethyl chitosan encapsulating indocyanine green and apoptotic peptides functionalized gold nanoparticles, which together form a dual pH&#8208; and photoresponsive therapeutic platform. NanoLock can simultaneously inhibit nutrient supply and energy production, resulting in effectively eliminating tumors while preserving oral functions.








Abstract
The major challenge in oral cancer is the lack of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art treatment modality that effectively cures cancer while preserving oral functions. Recent insights into tumor metabolic dependency provide a therapeutic opportunity for exploring optimal treatment approaches. Herein, a smart responsive &#8220;Energy NanoLock&#8221; is developed to improve cancer metabolic intervention by simultaneously inhibiting nutrient supply and energy production. NanoLock is a pomegranate&#8208;like nanocomplex of cyclicRGD&#8208;modified carboxymethyl chitosan (CyclicRC, pI = 6.7) encapsulating indocyanine green and apoptotic peptides functionalized gold nanoparticles (IK&#8208;AuNPs), which together form a dual pH&#8208; and photoresponsive therapeutic platform. NanoLock exhibits good stability under physiological conditions, but releases small&#8208;size CyclicRC and IK&#8208;AuNPs in response to the tumor acidic microenvironment, leading to deep tumor penetration. CyclicRC targets integrins to inhibit tumor angiogenesis, and consequently blocks tumor nutrient supply. Meanwhile, IK&#8208;AuNPs specifically induce apoptotic peptides and photothermally mediated mitochondrial collapse, and consequently inhibits endogenous energy production, thereby facilitating cell death. Importantly, in both xenograft and orthotopic oral cancer models, NanoLock selectively eliminates tumors with little cross&#8208;reactivity with normal tissues, especially oral functions, resulting in prolonged survival of mice. Therefore, NanoLock provides a novel metabolic therapy to exploit synergistic inhibition of exogenous nutrient supply and endogenous energy production, which potentially advances oral cancer treatment.

         <title>P&#8208;Mediated Cu&#8211;N4 Sites in Carbon Nitride Realizing CO2 Photoreduction to C2H4 with Selectivity Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8211;N4 sites anchored P&#8208;modulated carbon nitride (CuACs/PCN) is prepared as a photocatalyst to tailor the intermediate energy levels in the C2H4 formation reaction pathway. The formation of the C&#8722;C coupling intermediates can be realized on Cu&#8211;N4 sites, and the surrounding P facilitates the C2H4 production. CuACs/PCN exhibits a high C2H4 selectivity of 53.2% with a yield of 30.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction to high value&#8208;added C2 products (e.g., C2H4) is of considerable interest but challenging. The C2H4 product selectivity strongly hinges on the intermediate energy levels in the CO2 reduction pathway. Herein, Cu&#8211;N4 sites anchored phosphorus&#8208;modulated carbon nitride (CuACs/PCN) is designed as a photocatalyst to tailor the intermediate energy levels in the the C2H4 formation reaction pathway for realizing its high production with tunable selectivity. Theoretical calculations combined with experimental data demonstrate that the formation of the C&#8722;C coupling intermediates can be realized on Cu&#8211;N4 sites and the surrounding doped P facilitates the production of C2H4. Thus, CuACs/PCN exhibits a high C2H4 selectivity of 53.2% with a yielding rate of 30.51 &#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1. The findings reveal the significant role of the coordination environment and surrounding microenvironment of Cu single atoms in C2H4 formation and offer an effective approach for highly selective CO2 photoreduction to produce C2H4.

         <title>Precise Functionalization of a Multiple&#8208;Resonance Framework: Constructing Narrowband Organic Electroluminescent Materials with External Quantum Efficiency over 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic methodology is implemented for functionalizing brominated B&#63743;N&#8208;containing multiple&#8208;resonance framework with multifarious electron groups, such as donors, acceptors, and moieties without obvious push&#8211;pull electron properties. The optimized m&#8208;DPAcP&#8211;BNCz&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibits green emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 28 nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.6%.








Abstract
It is of important strategic significance to develop high&#8208;efficiency narrowband organic electroluminescent materials that can be employed to fabricate ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays with wide color gamut. This topic implies a great challenge to molecular design and synthesis, especially for the development of universality, diversity, scalability, and robustness of molecular architectonics. In this work, a synthetic methodology is demonstrated for functionalizing brominated B&#63743;N&#8208;containing multiple&#8208;resonance (MR) frameworks with multifarious functional groups, such as donors, acceptors, and moieties without obvious push&#8211;pull electron properties. The m&#8208;DPAcP&#8211;BNCz&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) exhibits green emission with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 28&#160;nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 40.6%. The outstanding performance of m&#8208;DPAcP&#8211;BNCz is attributed to the perfect integration of the inherent advantages of the MR framework and the donor&#8211;acceptor configuration, which can not only achieve bathochromic shift and narrowband emission, but also obtain high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) and horizontal emitting dipole orientation ratio (&#920;//). This straightforward and efficient approach provides insightful guidance for the construction and enrichment of more high&#8208;efficiency narrowband emitters.

         <title>Towards Efficient and Stable Donor&#8208;Acceptor Luminescent Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl(TTM) radical derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Donor substituents vary depending on the extent of conjugation and the number of nitrogen atoms. Experimental and theoretical results indicate that the key to maximize photoluminescent quantum efficiency(PLQE) is to tune the right balance of the charge transfer energy with respect to both the ground&#8208;state and local&#8208;excitation state energies.








Abstract
In contrast to closed&#8208;shell luminescent molecules, the electronic ground state and lowest excited state in organic luminescent radicals are both spin doublet, which results in spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. Most reported luminescent radicals with high photoluminescent quantum efficiency (PLQE) have a donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A&#8226;) chemical structure where an electron&#8208;donating group is covalently attached to an electron&#8208;withdrawing radical core (A&#8226;). Understanding the main factors that define the efficiency and stability of D&#8208;A&#8226; type luminescent radicals remains challenging. Here, we&#160;designed and synthesized a series of tri(2,4,6&#8208;trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical derivatives with donor substituents varying by their extent of conjugation and their number of imine&#8208;type nitrogen atoms. The experimental results suggest that the luminescence efficiency and stability of the radicals are proportional to the degree of conjugation but inversely proportional to the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituents. These experimental trends are very well reproduced by density functional theory calculations. The theoretical results indicate that both the luminescence efficiency and radical stability are related to the energy difference between the charge transfer (CT) and local&#8208;excitation (LE) states, which decreases as either the number of imine nitrogen atoms in the substituent increases or its conjugation length decreases.

         <title>Engineering Electrodes with Robust Conducting Hydrogel Coating for Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectrodes with Robust Conducting Hydrogel Coating for Neural recording and Modulation: Bioelectrodes are engineered with a conducting hydrogel layer, featuring robust interfacial adhesion, long&#8208;term reliability, highly&#8208;desirable electronic conductivity, and mechanical compliance, for long&#8208;term electrophysiological recordings of neural activities and low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation.








Abstract
Coating conventional metallic electrodes with conducting polymers has enabled the essential characteristics required for bioelectronics, such as biocompatibility, electrical conductivity, mechanical compliance, and the capacity for structural and chemical functionalization of the bioelectrodes. However, the fragile interface between the conducting polymer and the electrode in wet physiological environment greatly limits their utility and reliability. Here, a general yet reliable strategy to seamlessly interface conventional electrodes with conducting hydrogel coatings is established, featuring tissue&#8208;like modulus, highly&#8208;desirable electrochemical properties, robust interface, and long&#8208;term reliability. Numerical modeling reveals the role of toughening mechanism, synergy of covalent anchorage of long&#8208;chain polymers, and chemical cross&#8208;linking, in improving the long&#8208;term robustness of the interface. Through in vivo implantation in freely&#8208;moving mouse models, it is shown that stable electrophysiological recording can be achieved, while the conducting hydrogel&#8211;electrode interface remains robust during the long&#8208;term low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation. This simple yet versatile design strategy addresses the long&#8208;standing technical challenges in functional bioelectrode engineering, and opens up new avenues for the next&#8208;generation diagnostic brain&#8208;machine&#160;interfaces.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;A hybrid hydrogel (PMH) judiciously integrated by modified needle coke as solar absorber with polyvinyl alcohol as hydratable matrix and its implementation as evaporator for solar desalination are reported. The Hofmeister chaotropic ions can interfere hydrogen-bonding networks of PMH and strengthen corresponding hydration chemistry, thus delivering a lowered water vaporization enthalpy and an elevated evaporation performance of PMH in brine.

         <title>A Review of Scalable Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) Synthesis for Present and Future Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesis are reviewed, the challenges and opportunities for each method are discussed, and their relevance to emerging applications is contextualized. Maintaining stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 in the growing crystal and enabling stacking order between layers emerge as the main challenges. Advances in these aspects will inform/guide the synthesis of other 2D materials with &gt;1 constituent element.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is a layered inorganic synthetic crystal exhibiting high temperature stability and high thermal conductivity. As a ceramic material it has been widely used for thermal management, heat shielding, lubrication, and as a filler material for structural composites. Recent scientific advances in isolating atomically thin monolayers from layered van der Waals crystals to study their unique properties has propelled research interest in mono/few layered h&#8208;BN as a wide bandgap insulating support for nanoscale electronics, tunnel barriers, communications, neutron detectors, optics, sensing, novel separations, quantum emission from defects, among others. Realizing these futuristic applications hinges on scalable cost&#8208;effective high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN synthesis. Here, the authors&#160;review scalable approaches of high&#8208;quality mono/multilayer h&#8208;BN synthesis, discuss the challenges and opportunities for each method, and contextualize their relevance to emerging applications. Maintaining a stoichiometric balance B:N = 1 as the atoms incorporate into the growing layered crystal and maintaining stacking order between layers during multi&#8208;layer synthesis emerge as some of the main challenges for h&#8208;BN synthesis and the development of processes to address these aspects can inform and guide the synthesis of other layered materials with more than one constituent element. Finally, the authors contextualize h&#8208;BN synthesis efforts along with quality requirements for emerging applications via a technological roadmap.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Doped P&#8208;Type InAs Nanocrystal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn enables the fabrication of heavy metal free, RoHS compliant nanocrystal&#8208;based field effect transistors, which exhibit either n&#8208; or p&#8208;type characteristics. Advanced structural characterization of the doped nanocrystals highlights the importance of Zn dopant chemistry on the doping efficiency. This study sets the stage for future development of nanocrystals&#8208;based opto&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III&#8211;V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots (QDs) are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8211;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals (NCs), that are of particular relevance for short&#8208;wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. The p&#8208;type doping of InAs NCs is presented with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping is achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near infrared&#160;photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high&#8208;resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short&#8208;wave infrared region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Gate&#8208;Tunable Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in Lattice&#8208;Matched InSb/CdTe Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe heterostructures are utilized to tailor the nonreciprocal charge transport up to room temperature. Benefiting from both the inversion symmetry breaking and interfacial Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling, this nonmagnetic hybrid system not only warrants a pronounced unidirectional magnetoresistance effect, but also enables highly efficient gate tuning of the rectification response, hence offering feasible strategies for controllable spin&#8211;orbit applications.








Abstract
Symmetry manipulation can be used to effectively tailor the physical order in solid&#8208;state systems. With the breaking of both the inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, nonreciprocal magneto&#8208;transport may arise in nonmagnetic systems to enrich spin&#8211;orbit effects. Here, the observation of unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe films is investigated up to room temperature. Benefiting from the strong built&#8208;in electric field of 0.13 V&#160;nm&#8722;1 in the heterojunction region, the resulting Rashba&#8208;type spin&#8211;orbit coupling and quantum confinement result in a distinct sinusoidal UMR signal with a nonreciprocal coefficient that is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude larger than most non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials at 298 K. Moreover, this heterostructure configuration enables highly efficient gate tuning of the rectification response, wherein the UMR amplitude is enhanced by 40%. The results of this study advocate the use of narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based hybrid systems with robust spin textures as suitable platforms for the pursuit of controllable chiral spin&#8211;orbit applications.

         <title>Enabling Durable Ultralow&#8208;k Capacitors with Enhanced Breakdown Strength in Density&#8208;Variant Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit bi&#8208;phase deformation by which the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region, acquiring high strength, and ductility like composites. This deformation improves the electrical breakdown strength of the density&#8208;variant nanolattice by &#8776;3.3&#8208;fold of the uniform&#8208;density nanolattice, while maintaining the ultralow&#8208;k&#160;of &#8776;1.2 with complete electric and dielectric stability and recoverability during 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.








Abstract
Ultralow&#8208;k materials used in high voltage devices require mechanical resilience and electrical and dielectric stability even when subjected to mechanical loads. Existing devices with organic polymers suffer from low thermal and mechanical stability while those with inorganic porous structures struggle with poor mechanical integrity. Recently, 3D hollow&#8208;beam nanolattices have emerged as promising candidates that satisfy these requirements. However, their properties are maintained for only five stress cycles at strains below 25%. Here,&#160;we&#160;demonstrate that alumina nanolattices with different relative density distributions across their height elicit a deterministic mechanical response concomitant with a 1.5&#8211;3.3 times higher electrical breakdown strength than nanolattices with uniform density. These density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit an ultralow&#8208;k of &#8776;1.2, accompanied by complete electric and dielectric stability and mechanical recoverability over 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain.&#160;We&#160;explain the enhanced insulation and long&#8208;term cyclical stability by the bi&#8208;phase deformation where the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region as it is compressed before the higher&#8208;density region, allowing to simultaneously possess high strength and ductility like composites. This study highlights the superior electrical performance of the bi&#8208;phase nanolattice with a single interface in providing stable conduction and maximum breakdown strength.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Power Vertical Transistors for Multilevel Decoding Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition&#8208;metal carbides/nitrides (MXene)&#8208;organic single crystal vertical transistor exhibits a fast switching characteristic under an ultralow operating voltage of &#8722;1&#160;mV, meanwhile consumes only 8.7 aJ per spike when working as an electrical synaptic transistor.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors with parallel transmission and learning functions are of interest in the development of brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. However, the poor performance and high power consumption are the two main issues limiting their practical applications. Herein, an ultralow&#8208;power vertical transistor is demonstrated based on transition&#8208;metal carbides/nitrides (MXene) and organic single crystal. The transistor exhibits a high JON of 16.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high JON/JOFF ratio of 9.12 &#215; 105 under an ultralow working voltage of &#8722;1&#160;mV. Furthermore, it can successfully simulate the functions of biological synapse under electrical modulation along with consuming only 8.7 aJ of power per spike. It also permits multilevel information decoding modes with a significant gap between the readable time of professionals and nonprofessionals, producing a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio up to 114.15&#160;dB. This work encourages the use of vertical transistors and organic single crystal in decoding information and advances the development of low&#8208;power neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Functionalized Nanocomposite Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Strong Alkaline&#8208;Tolerance and High Zinc Anode Stability for Ultralong&#8208;Life Flexible Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible zinc&#8211;air batteries have attracted extensive interests, for which the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes. This study reports a sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance, and high zinc anode stability, endowing an ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h and high power output for the fabricated zinc&#8211;air battery.








Abstract
Increasing pursuit of next&#8208;generation wearable electronics has put forward the demand of reliable energy devices with high flexibility, durability, and enhanced electrochemical performances. Flexible aqueous zinc&#8211;air batteries (FAZABs) have attracted great interests owing to the high energy density, safety, and environmental benignity, for which quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state gel polymer electrolytes (QSGPEs) are state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolytes with high ionic conductivity, flexibility, and resistance to leakage problems of traditional liquid electrolytes. Compared to commonly used PVA&#8211;KOH electrolyte with poor electrolyte retention capability and cycling stability, a new type of sulfonate functionalized nanocomposite QSGPE is applied in FAZABs with high ionic conductivity, strong alkaline tolerance, and high zinc anode stability. Notably, the existence of (1) strong anionic sulfonate groups of QSGPEs, contributing to the exposure of preferred Zn (002) plane that is more resistant to zinc dendrite formation, and (2) nano&#8208;attapulgite electrolyte additives, beneficial for the enhancement of ionic conductivity, electrolyte uptake, and retention capability, endows a ultralong cycling life of 450&#160;h for the fabricated FAZAB. Furthermore, flexible energy belts and knittable energy wires fabricated with a series/parallel unit of several FAZABs can be used to power various wearable electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure&#8208;Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many applications require on&#8208;demand control of adhesion at an interface without significant power consumption. In this work, a new form of adhesive termed &#8220;pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive&#8221; (PTA) is presented. PTAs are elastomeric surfaces patterned with stiff, axisymmetric asperities. The adhesive force of the PTA increases with increasing applied preload. The pressure&#8208;tunable adhesion is demonstrated for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling.








Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, a pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate is presented. It is demonstrated that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, a contact mechanics model is developed to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4 to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1 to 30&#160;mN. Finally, the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength is demonstrated by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling. The approach in pressure&#8208;tunable adhesive design based on self&#8208;assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.

         <title>Unraveling the Stretch&#8208;Induced Microstructural Evolution and Morphology&#8211;Stretchability Relationships of High&#8208;Performance Ternary Organic Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multiscale morphology and stretch&#8208;induced microstructural evolution of the high&#8208;efficiency ternary organic solar cell blends are probed in real&#8208;time with multiple synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering techniques. The morphology&#8211;stretchability relations are established with stretchable metrics being predictable. This work sets a methodology for uncovering the regulation mechanisms of morphology, mechanics, and performance of stretchable organic electronics.








Abstract
The stretchability and stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution of organic solar cells (OSCs) are pivotal for their collapsible, portable, and wearable applications, and they are mainly affected by the complex morphology of active layers. Herein, a highly ductile conjugated polymer P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) is incorporated into the active layers of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs based on nonfullerene small molecule acceptors to simultaneously investigate the morphological, mechanical, and photovoltaic properties and structural evolution under stretching of ternary blend films with various acceptor contents. The structural robustness of the blend films is indicated by their stretch&#8208;induced structural evolution, which is monitored in real&#8208;time by a combination of in situ wide/small angle X&#8208;ray scattering. It is found that adding the soft P(NDI2OD&#8208;T2) can enhance the stretchability and structural robustness of ternary blend films by more entangled chains and tie chains to dissipate strain. Furthermore, the stretchability of the ternary blends can be superbly predicted by a 3D equivalent box model. This work provides instructive insight and guidance for designing stretchable electronics and predicting the stretchability of multicomponent blends.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Electronics for Prognostic Monitoring of Methylated Circulating Tumor DNAs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable device with self&#8208;healing electronics is developed for highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective analysis of methylated ctDNAs from transdermal extracted interstitial fluid (ISF), which is demonstrated as a skin patch device for monitoring the disease indicative biomarker. Especially, the device is featured with a flexible construction and remains electrically functional significant structural defects are induced by bending or distortion from everyday usage.








Abstract
Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self&#8208;healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor&#8208;based (FET&#8208;based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro&#8208;stereolithography&#8208;based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self&#8208;healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self&#8208;healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&#8722;16&#160;m in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real&#8208;time in vivo analysis of disease&#8208;indicative biomarkers, this proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self&#8208;administrable procedure.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methylated circulating DNAs (ctDNAs) have recently been reported as a promising biomarker for early cancer diagnostics, but limited tools are currently available for continuous and dynamic profiling of ctDNAs and their methylation levels, especially when such assays need to be conducted in point-of-care (POC) scenarios. Here, a self-healing bioelectronic patch (iMethy) is developed that combines transdermal interstitial fluid (ISF) extraction and field effect transistor-based (FET-based) biosensing for dynamic monitoring of methylated ctDNAs as a prognostic approach for cancer risk management. The projection micro-stereolithography-based 3D patterning of an Eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) circuit with an unprecedented 10&#160;&#181;m resolution enables the construction of self-healing EGaIn microfluidic circuits that remain conductive under 100% strain and self-healing under severe destruction. In combination with continuous transdermal ISF sampling of methylated ctDNAs, iMethy can detect ctDNAs as low as 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; in cellular models and is capable of phenotypic analysis of tumor growth in rodent animals. As the first demonstration of a wearable device for real-time in vivo analysis of disease-indicative biomarkers, this proof-of-concept study well demonstrated the potential of the iMethy platform for cancer risk management based on dynamic transdermal surveillance of methylated ctDNAs via a painless and self-administrable procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Integrated Polymeric mRNA Vaccine without Inflammation Side Effects for Cellular Immunity Mediated Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of alternating copolymers &#8220;PHTA&#8221; featured with ortho&#8208;hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeat units is&#160;developed for mRNA cancer vaccine delivery. Such an integrated PHTA&#8208;based polymeric nanoplatform shows negligible inflammatory side effects, and the top candidate PHTA&#8208;C18 can successfully deliver mRNA cancer vaccine in vivo, leading to a robust CD8+ T cell mediated antitumor cellular immunity.








Abstract
Among the few available mRNA delivery vehicles, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are the most clinically advanced but they require cumbersome four components and suffer from inflammation&#8208;related side effects that should be minimized for safety. Yet, a certain level of proinflammatory responses and innate immune activation are required to evoke T&#8208;cell immunity for mRNA cancer vaccination. To address these issues and develop potent yet low&#8208;inflammatory mRNA cancer vaccine vectors, a series of alternating copolymers &#8220;PHTA&#8221; featured with ortho&#8208;hydroxy tertiary amine (HTA) repeating units for mRNA delivery is synthesized, which can play triple roles of condensing mRNA, enhancing the polymeric nanoparticle (PNP) stability, and prolonging circulation time. Unlike LNPs exhibiting high levels of inflammation, the PHTA&#8208;based PNPs show negligible inflammatory side effects in vivo. Importantly, the top candidate PHTA&#8208;C18 enables successful mRNA cancer vaccine delivery in vivo and leads&#160;to a robust CD8+ T cell mediated antitumor cellular immunity. Such PHTA&#8208;based integrated PNP provides a potential approach for establishing mRNA cancer vaccines with good inflammatory safety profiles.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is developed to fabricate intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors (ISOTFTs) with low operating voltage below 5 V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability. Further, the transistor amplifier shows a high gain of 90 V V&#8722;1 and ultrasensitive detection for human electro&#8208;oculogram signals.








Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt;A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance, and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V V&#8722;1 among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Tension&#8208;Induced Cavitation in Li&#8208;Metal Stripping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping pathways controlled by the ratio of supporting solid structures (SSS) thickness to Li whisker radius are uncovered by in situ transmission electron microscope (TEM). For whiskers with t/r ratio smaller than a critical value, Li0 strips via multisite cavitation with severe buckling and Li0 &#8220;trapping&#8221;; for whiskers with t/r ratio being larger than the critical value, Li0 undergoes planar stripping and negligible SSS buckling.








Abstract
Designing stable Li metal and supporting solid structures (SSS) is of fundamental importance in rechargeable Li&#8208;metal batteries. Yet, the stripping kinetics of Li metal and its mechanical effect on the supporting solids (including solid electrolyte interface) remain mysterious to date. Here, through nanoscale in situ observations of a solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal battery in an electron microscope, two distinct cavitation&#8208;mediated Li stripping modes controlled by the ratio of the SSS thickness (t) to the Li deposit's radius (r) are discovered. A quantitative criterion is established to understand the damage tolerance of SSS on the Li&#8208;metal stripping pathways. For mechanically unstable SSS (t/r&#160;&lt; 0.21), the stripping proceeds via tension&#8208;induced multisite cavitation accompanied by severe SSS buckling and necking, ultimately leading to Li &#8220;trapping&#8221; or &#8220;dead Li&#8221; formation; for mechanically stable SSS (t/r&#160;&gt; 0.21), the Li metal undergoes nearly planar stripping from the root via single cavitation, showing negligible buckling. This work proves the existence of an electronically conductive precursor film coated on the interior of solid electrolytes that however can be mechanically damaged, and it is of potential importance to the design of delicate Li&#8208;metal supporting structures to high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and environmentally friendly method, through boric acid, to remove the residual amine in zinc oxide (ZnO) without decomposing ZnO is reported. Consequently, the optimized tandem organic solar cells (OSCs) output of 19.56% power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term illumination stability of OSCs are significantly improved.








Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO is reported. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) is selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer are optimized through rinsing them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination are significantly improved. The optimal 0.04&#160;and 1.00&#160;cm2&#160;single&#8208;junction OSCs are based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9&#160;bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibit a 19.56% PCE, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>A BF3&#8208;Doped MXene Dual&#8208;Layer Interphase for Reliable Lithium Metal Anode</title>

Abstract
To maintain a reliable lithium deposition and extraction on lithium metal anode during charging/discharging, surface modification poses a promising way in reaching high energy&#8208;density batteries. We report a dual&#8208;layer interphase that consists of an in&#8208;situ formed lithium carboxylate organic layer and an ultra&#8208;thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene on Li metal surface. The honeycomb&#8208;structured organic layer increases the wetting of electrolyte due to the large surface area, leading to a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI). While the BF3&#8208;doped monolayer MXene provides abundant active sites for lithium homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in about 50% reduced thickness of inorganic&#8208;rich components among the SEI layer. A low overpotential of less than 30&#160;mV over 1000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells was received. The functional BF3 groups along with the excellent electronic conductivity and smooth surface of the MXene greatly reduce the lithium plating/stripping energy barrier, enabling a dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal anode. The battery with the dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal (D&#8208;Li) as anode displayed greatly improved electrochemical performance. The battery paired with NMC811 exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.1%. A high capacity&#8208;retention of 175.4 mAh/g at 1.0 C was achieved after 350 cycles. After long 500 cycles, a reliable capacity was still remained while the cell with un&#8208;modified Li metal quickly dropped to below 74.2 mAh/g. In a pouch cell with a capacity of 475 mAh, the battery still exhibited a high discharge capacity of 165.6 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 200 cycles, while the cell with pure Li metal decreased to 80.5%. In contrast to the fast capacity decay of pure Li metal, the battery using NCA as cathode also displayed excellent capacity retention in both coin and pouch cells. The BF3&#8208;doped 2D MXene dual&#8208;layer modified surface provides an effective approach in stabilizing Li metal anode in rapidly growing large energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Strategies to Extend the Lifetime of Perovskite Down&#8208;conversion Films for Display Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have outstanding luminescent properties that are suitable for displays that have high color purity and high absorption coefficient; so they have been evaluated for application as light emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), light converters for down&#8208;conversion displays, and future near&#8208;eye augmented reality/virtual reality displays. However, PeNCs are chemically vulnerable to heat, light, and moisture, and these weaknesses must be overcome before devices that use PeNCs can be commercialized. This review examines strategies to overcome the low stability of PeNCs and thereby permit the fabrication of stable down&#8208;conversion films, and summarizes down&#8208;conversion&#8208;type display applications and future prospects. First, we examine methods to increase the chemical stability of PeNCs. Second, we review methods to encapsulate PeNC down&#8208;conversion films to increase their lifetime. Third, we summarize methods to increase the long&#8208;term compatibility of resin with PeNCs, and finally, how to secure stability using fillers added to the resin. Fourth, we then describe the method to manufacture down&#8208;conversion film and the procedure to evaluate their reliability for commercialization. Finally, we explore the prospects of a down&#8208;conversion system that exploits the properties of PeNCs and can be eventually employed to fabricate very fine patterns for high&#8208;resolution displays and for near&#8208;eye augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) devices.

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique three&#8208;dimensional structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on our understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Radiotherapy Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment to Enhance Antitumor Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) uses ionizing radiation to eradicate localized tumors and, in rare cases, control tumors outside of the irradiated fields via stimulating an antitumor immune response (abscopal effect). However, the therapeutic effect of RT is often limited by inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia, abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix (ECM), and an immunosuppressive TME. Thus, it is critical to develop new RT strategies that can remodel the TME to overcome radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression. In the past decade, high&#8208;Z element nanoparticles have been developed to increase radiotherapeutic indices of localized tumors by reducing X&#8208;ray doses and side effects to normal tissues and enhance abscopal effects by activating the TME to elicit systemic antitumor immunity. In this review, we will discuss the principles of RT and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT and remodel TMEs for enhanced antitumor efficacy. We will also highlight the challenges in clinical translation of multi&#8208;functional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, we investigate the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibited stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6 and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibited moderate donor/acceptor (D/A) interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helped to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors were over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors showed appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23 further optimized multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which resulted in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homojunction Organic Nonfullerene Photovoltaics Featuring Fundamentals Distinct from Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonfullerene organic solar cells based on quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804;10 wt.%) are fabricated. A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.








Abstract
In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll&#8208;off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7&#8208;Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.

&lt;p&gt;Nonfullerene organic solar cells based on quasi-homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804;10 wt.%) are fabricated. A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high-efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi-homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high-efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7-Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll-off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7-Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Implantable Magnetic Vascular Scaffold for Circulating Tumor Cell Removal In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a new type of vascular&#8208;like ITD with artificial adhesion repertoires and a wireless magnetothermal response for high metastatic circulating tumor cell removal in vivo is proposed. The ITD implanted in the artery mainly comprises PLLA fibers encapsulated with FeCo@G and a 3D structure with HA and gelatin for the preparation of bioinspired adhesive sites.








Abstract
An integrated trapped device (ITD) capable of removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can assuage or even prevent metastasis. However, adhesion repertoires are ordinarily neglected in the design of ITDs, possibly leading to the omission of highly metastatic CTC and treatment failure. Here a vascular&#8208;like ITD with adhesive sites and wireless magnetothermal response to remove highly metastatic CTC in vivo is presented. Such a vascular&#8208;like ITD comprises circumferential well&#8208;aligned fibers and artificial adhesion repertoires and is optimized for magnetothermal integration. Continuous and repeated capture in a dynamic environment increases capture efficiency over time. Meanwhile, the heat generation of the ITD leads to the capture of CTC death owing to cell heat sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed bioinspired ultrastructure of the ITD prevents vascular blockage and induces potential vascular regeneration. Overall, this work defines an extendable strategy for constructing adhesion repertoires against intravascular shear forces, provides a vascular&#8208;like ITD for reducing CTC counts, and is expected to alleviate the risk of cancer recurrence.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of High&#8208;Quality Graphene Films via Electrostatic&#8208;Repulsion Aligning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films are assembled from pristine graphene nanosheets via electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning where highly electronegative titania nanosheets play a key role. The obtained graphene films present significantly enhanced mechanical properties and electrical properties for electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal&#8208;management multifunctional applications in smart and wearable electronics.








Abstract
Assembling pristine graphene into freestanding films featuring high electrical conductivity, superior flexibility, and robust mechanical strength aims at meeting the all&#8208;around high criteria of new&#8208;generation electronics. However, voids and defects produced in the macroscopic assembly process of graphene nanosheets severely degrade the performance of graphene films, and mechanical brittleness often limits their applications in wide scenarios. To address such challenges, an electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning strategy is demonstrated to produce highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films. Typically, the high electronegativity of titania nanosheets (TiNS) induces the aligning of negatively charged graphene nanosheets via electrostatic repulsion in the film assembly. The resultant graphene films show fine microstructure, enhanced mechanical properties, and improved electrical conductivity up to 1.285 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1. Moreover, the graphene films can withstand 5000 repeated folding without structural damage and electrical resistance fluctuation. These comprehensive improved properties, combined with the facile synthesis method and scalable production, make these graphene films a promising platform for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal&#8208;management applications in smart and wearable electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micropollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular engineering of amorphous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) successfully generates hydrophilic porous materials, which exhibit an exceptional removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% of phenol derivatives) and excellent recyclability. The photothermal characteristics of oxidized CTFs show a high volatile organic compound (VOC) rejection rate (&#8776;98% of phenol). Synergistic interplay of high&#8208;performance adsorption and solar&#8208;driven evaporation enables complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of mixture of phenol derivatives.








Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires an energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% in 10&#160;s) and can be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Quaternary 2D BiCuSeO p&#8208;Type Semiconductor with Intrinsic Degeneracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets with heteroanionic crystal structure are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Its intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy is systemically revealed and leveraged for fabricating 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors. These results significantly boost the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of tunnel devices.








Abstract
2D BiCuSeO is an intrinsic p&#8208;type degenerate semiconductor due to its self&#8208;doping effect, which possesses great potential to fabricate high&#8208;performance 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs). However, the controllable synthesis of multinary 2D materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still a challenge due to the restriction of thermodynamics. Here, the CVD synthesis of quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets is realized. As&#8208;grown BiCuSeO nanosheets with thickness down to &#8776;6.1&#160;nm (&#8776;7 layers) and domain size of &#8776;277&#160;&#181;m show excellent ambient stability. Intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, capable of maintaining even in a few layers, is comprehensively unveiled. By varying the thicknesses and temperatures, the carrier concentration of BiCuSeO nanosheets can be adjusted in the range of 1019 to 1021 cm&#8722;3, and the Hall mobility of BiCuSeO is &#8776;191 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (at 2 K). Furthermore, taking advantage of the p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, a prototypical BiCuSeO/MoS2 TFET is fabricated. The emergence of the negative differential resistance trend and multifunctional diodes by modulating the gate voltage and temperature reveal the great practical implementation potential of BiCuSeO nanosheets. These results pave way for the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of high&#8208;performance tunnel devices.

These results pave way for the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of high-performance tunnel devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis and Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered polymeric adsorbent (SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively adsorb chemo exposure in the GI tract is developed. The SPORA&#8208;SN9 sharply decreases the toxic chemo content of the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen, thereby preventing chemo&#8208;induced GI mucositis and chemo&#8208;induced microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the protected gut microbiome improves the antitumor efficacy of the followed immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) is reported, which can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protects the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol is achieved in a flow&#8208;cell, which is enabled by V&#8208;doped Cu2Se hierarchical nanotubes. The hierarchical nanotubes meet the requirement for flow&#8208;cells while the V doping steers the reaction pathway toward ethanol production.








Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products is heavily pursued because of their commercial values, and the efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. A flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, it is reported that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cells and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by the experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and, as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens an avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>Robust and Multifunctional Kirigami Electronics with a Tough and Permeable Aramid Nanofiber Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing robust and multifunctional kirigami electronics for wearable applications imposes strict restrictions on the constituent materials. In this work, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto the CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve measurements of physiological parameters.








Abstract
Kirigami designs are advantageous for the construction of wearable electronics due to their high stretchability and conformability on the 3D dynamic surfaces of the skin. However, suitable materials technologies that enable robust kirigami devices with desired functionality for skin&#8208;interfaces remain limited. Here, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. The self&#8208;assembled fibrillar network involving aramid nanofibers and poly(vinyl alcohol) combines high toughness, permeability, and manufacturability, which are desirable for the fabrication of hybrid devices. Multiscale simulations are conducted to explain the high fracture resistance of the&#160;CNFF&#8208;based kirigami structures and provide essential guidance for the design, which can be further generalized to other kirigami devices. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto a CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyogram (EMG), skin&#8208;temperature measurements, and measurement of other physiological parameters. These mechanically robust, multifunctional, lightweight, and biocompatible kirigami devices can shed new insights for the development of advanced wearable systems and human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, Long&#8208;Range Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides and two crystalline cobalt oxides are studied in&#160;situ to deduce the role of the reconstruction conditions, the effect of the electrolyte, and structure&#8211;activity relations for near&#8208;neutral water oxidation. Multiple aspects are considered and interconnected, deducing a comprehensive concept for the different electrocatalytic performances, including mass transport.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same short&#8208;range order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#183;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface. Ex situ and in situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass&#8208;transport limitations, a comprehensive picture is provided explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bonded buffers, and the morphology. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in near&#8208;neutral potassium borate medium at 1.62&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;month without degrading performance.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Assisted Cobalt Ditelluride Polyhedra Inducing Lattice Strain to Endow Efficient Adsorption&#8208;Catalysis for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Lattice strain generated by Zn&#8208;doped CoTe2 polyhedra balances the intrinsic catalytic effect and the adsorption of polysulfides, and the catalytic mechanism for accelerating polysulfide conversion is verified in combination with d&#8208;band center theory, Bader charge, and Gibbs free energy. It offers a guiding idea for the device of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Developing a conductive catalyst with high catalytic activity is considered to be an effective strategy for improving cathode kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially at large current density and with lean electrolytes. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering has been a strategy to tune the local structure of catalysts and to help understand the structure&#8211;activity relationship between strain and catalyst performance. Here, Co0.9Zn0.1Te2@NC is constructed after zinc atoms are uniformly doped into the CoTe2 lattice. The experimental/theoretical results indicate that a change of the coordination environment for the cobalt atom by the lattice strain modulates the d&#8208;band center with more electrons occupied in antibonding orbitals, thus balancing the adsorption of polysulfides and the intrinsic catalytic effect, thereby activating the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Benefiting from the merits, with only 4 wt% dosages of catalyst in the cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 1 C and stable cycling performances are achieved for 1500/2500 cycles at 1 C/2 C. Upon sulfur loading of 7.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the areal capacity can reach 12.8 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work provides a guiding methodology for the design of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies for the rational design of cathode in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Decorated Nanostructure for Precision Sonodynamic&#8208;Catalytic Therapy of MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable nanostructure is developed and assessed for outstanding biofilm disruption effect by capturing bacteria and penetrating biofilm matrix of guanidinium, and the synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic effect. The remotely controlled nanostructure efficiently clears infection and mediates the inflammation resolution in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;infected osteomyelitis, thus providing a novel sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy for osteomyelitis.








Abstract
Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life&#8208;threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep&#8208;seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy of MRSA&#8208;infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium&#8208;rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)&#8208;absorbing gold&#8208;doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep&#8208;penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates 1O2 for sonodynamic therapy and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into toxic &#8226;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria&#8208;capturing ability, the biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and the subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to M2&#8208;type while suppressing the M1&#8208;type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.

         <title>Dense Local Triplet States and Steric Shielding of a Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enable High&#8208;Performance Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.132, 0.092), narrow full width at half maximum of 22&#160;nm, and high external quantum efficiency of 23.4% is developed by introducing bulky biphenyls and N&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;N&#8208;ortho&#8208;dimethylphenylamine that create dense local triplet states and suppress intramolecular aggregation. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules based on boron and nitrogen atoms are emerging as next&#8208;generation blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrow emission spectra and triplet harvesting properties. However, intermolecular aggregation stemming from the planar structure of typical MR&#8208;TADF molecules that leads to concentration quenching and broadened spectra limits the utilization of the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Herein, a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me, is developed to suppress intermolecular interactions effectively. Furthermore, photophysical investigation and theoretical calculations reveal that adding biphenyl moieties to the core body creates dense local triplet states in the vicinity of S1 and T1 energetically, letting the emitter harvest excitons efficiently. OLEDs based on pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a pure&#8208;blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.132, 0.092), which are maintained even at a high doping concentration of 100&#160;wt%. Furthermore, by incorporating a conventional TADF sensitizer, deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIE value of (0.133, 0.109) and an extremely high EQE of 30.1% are realized. These findings provide insight into design strategies for developing efficient deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters with fast triplet upconversion and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation.

         <title>Direct Observation of Self&#8208;Hybridized Exciton&#8208;Polaritons and Their Valley Polarizations in a Bare WS2 Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized exciton&#8208;polaritons in a bare WS2 layer is reported. The polariton emission is demonstrated to be controllable by varying the thickness of the sample or excitation power. It is also shown that the polariton inherits the valley degree of freedom from excitons and exhibits high valley polarization (Pv =&#160;0.18) at room temperature.








Abstract
The strong excitonic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have led to the successful demonstration of exciton&#8208;polaritons (EPs) in various optical cavity structures. Recently, self&#8208;hybridized EPs have been discovered in a bare TMD layer, but experimental investigation is still lacking because of their nonradiative nature. Herein, the direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized EPs in a bare multilayer WS2 via the evanescent field coupling technique is reported. Because of the thickness&#8208;dependent Rabi splitting energy, the dispersion curves of the EPs change sensitively with sample thickness. Moreover, continuous tuning of EP dispersion curves is demonstrated by controlling the excitation laser power. Lastly, it is observed that guided EPs retain valley polarization up to 0.2 at room temperature, representing a valley&#8208;preserved strong coupling regime. It is believed that the high tunability and valley polarization properties of the guided EPs in bare TMD layers can facilitate new nanophotonic and valleytronic applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Sustainable Defect&#8208;Passivation for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable dynamic passivation strategy by incorporating a photoisomeric molecule is put forward, which greatly enhances the photostability of perovskite photovoltaics. This dynamic strategy pays attention to and well matches the dynamics of defect generation during operation. The characteristics of the changeable molecular structure enable us to cope with defects updated in operation without introducing excess active sites.








Abstract
The generation of photoinduced defects and freely moving halogen ions is dynamically updated in real time. Accordingly, most reported strategies are static and short&#8208;term, which make their improvements in photostability very limited. Therefore, seeking new passivation strategies to match the dynamic characteristics of defect generation is very urgent. Without newly generated defects, a passivation molecule should exist in the configuration that would not become the initiation sites for defect generation. With newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should transfer into the other configuration that possesses the passivation sites. Herein, a classical photoisomeric molecule, spiropyran, is adopted, whose pre&#8208; and post&#8208;isomeric forms meet the requirements for two different configurations, to realize the state transition once the photoinduced defects appear during subsequent operation and dynamic capture for continuous renewal of defects. Consequently, spiropyrans work as light&#8208;triggered and self&#8208;healing sustainable passivation sites to realize continuous defect repair. The target devices retain 93% and 99% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 456&#160;h aging under ultraviolet illumination and 1200&#160;h aging under full&#8208;spectrum illumination, respectively. This work provides a novel concept of sustainable passivation strategy to realize continuous defect&#8208;passivation and film&#8208;healing in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Pd&#8211;Sb Rhombohedra with an Unconventional Rhombohedral Phase as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra&#160;with exposed (003) facets are successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient trifunctional catalysts. The specific ordered arrangement of Pd and Sb atoms on the Pd20Sb7(003) facet not only lowers the oxygen binding energy to an optimal value for the oxygen reduction reaction, but also reduces CO binding for superior resistance to CO poisoning during the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering is an important strategy for designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts with optimized activity and stability. From the thermodynamic point of view, it remains a great challenge to synthesize unconventional phases of noble metals. Here, a new class of Pd&#8208;based nanostructure with unconventional rhombohedral Pd20Sb7 phase is successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the high proportion of the unique exposed Pd20Sb7 (003) surface, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra display much enhanced ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction performance compared with commercial Pd/C. Moreover, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra are also demonstrated as an effective air cathode in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8211;air batteries with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH3CO* to CH3COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble AIEgen for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Kidney Fibrosis via SWIR Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly nanoprobe, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics is elaborately designed and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression, specifically 1 week of modeling, via short&#8208;wave infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The high renal clearance efficiency, outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive for renal fibrosis detection in preclinical settings.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of renal fibrosis is crucially significant on account of its worldwide prevalent tendency. Optical imaging in the near&#8208;infrared window has been recognized as an appealing technique for the timely detection of renal dysfunction. However, formulating a contrast agent that allows early monitoring of renal fibrosis and concurrently renally clearable in a normal group is still challenging. Herein, a nanosized fluorophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, is well&#8208;tailored and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression specifically in the early&#8208;stage via short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The small size (&#8776;26&#160;nm), renally filtrable molecular weight (3.3&#160;kDa), high renal clearance efficiency (93.1 &#177; 1.7% excretion through the kidneys within 24&#160;h), outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility, together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive and far superior to clinical diagnostic assays. The finding in this study would provide a blueprint for the next generation of diagnostic agents for the extent of renal fibrosis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered, Implantable, and Wirelessly Controlled NO Generation System for Intracranial Neuroglioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated and self&#8208;powered NO generation system for intracranial glioma gas therapy is designed. The NO releasing device, which is intracranially&#160;implanted, can be driven by a wearable triboelectric nanogenerator, and the system is wirelessly operated by a smartphone to control NO release for efficient intracranial glioma therapy.








Abstract
Gas therapy is an emerging technology for improving cancer therapy with high efficiency and low side effects. However, due to the existence of the gatekeeper of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the limited availability of current drug delivery systems, there still have been no reports on gas therapy for intracranial neuroglioma. Herein, an integrated, self&#8208;powered, and wirelessly controlled gas&#8208;therapy system is reported, which is composed of a self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self&#8208;driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self&#8208;controlled power source. When delivering energy to light a&#160;light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. The efficacy of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats is verified. This self&#8208;powered gas&#8208;therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.

         <title>Shining Transparent Displays with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent displays have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. In this work, the novel narrow&#8208;band blue&#8208;emitting NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design for transparent display. The fabricated prototype can render &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle and large color gamut.








Abstract
Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity, and good reliability, and the TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8211;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and microstructural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;c&#160;&#8776; 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;cfs&#160;&#8776; 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (S&#160;&#8776; 3; &#295;&#969;&#160;&#8776; 285 cm&#8722;1), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (Ea&#160;&#8776; 0.43&#160;eV) for NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ emission and layered architecture for screen film. These findings establish fundamental guidelines for narrow&#8208;band emitting materials design and shine light on superior TD innovative development.

&lt;p&gt;Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications.

A facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the fast synthesis of fully conjugated phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The as&#8208;prepared COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries with the achievement of a high reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;due to their good conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature.








Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (BBTC) and quinoxalino[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (QPPTC) in ZnCl2&#160;leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8211;1.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 100&#160;cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;for over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>Donor End&#8208;Capped Alkyl Chain Length Dependent Non&#8208;Radiative Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>

MPhS&#8208;C2 with shortened terminal alkyl chain, features thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condense packing, leading to suppressed upshifts of highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and efficient charge transport at small phase separation in BTP&#8208;eC9 blended devices, obtaining the highest PCE of 17.11% with &#916;Vnr of 0.192 V in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
A critical bottleneck for further efficiency breakthroughs in organic solar cells (OSCs) is to minimize the non&#8208;radiative energy loss (e&#916;Vnr) while maximizing the charge generation. With the development of highly emissive low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, the design of high&#8208;performance donors becomes critical to enable the blend with the electroluminescence quantum efficiency to approach or surpass the pristine acceptor. Herein, by shortening the end&#8208;capped alkyl chains of the small&#8208;molecular donors from hexyl (MPhS&#8208;C6) to ethyl (MPhS&#8208;C2), the material obtained aggregation that was&#160;insensitive to thermal annealing (TA) along with&#160;condensed packing simultaneously. The former leads to small phase separation and suppressed upshifts of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and the latter facilitates its efficient charge&#8208;transport at aggregation&#8208;less packing. Hence, the &#916;Vnr decreases from 0.242 to 0.182&#160;V, from MPhS&#8208;C6 to MPhS&#8208;C2 based OSCs. An excellent PCE of 17.11% is obtained by 1,8&#8208;diiodoctane addition due to almost unchanged high Jsc (26.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Voc (0.888&#160;V) with improved fill factor, which is the record efficiency with the smallest energy loss (0.497&#160;eV) and &#916;Vnr (0.192&#160;V) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs. These results emphasize the potential material design direction of obtaining concurrent TA&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condensed packing to maximize the device performances with a super low &#916;Vnr.

         <title>Dielectric Polymer with Designable Large Motion under Low Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions is reported to be actuated under low electric fields (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1). The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This induces a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in&#8208;plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e&#8208;field)&#8208;induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in&#8208;plane actuation is converted into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e&#8208;field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e&#8208;field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) is reported. The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a DE. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.

&lt;p&gt;Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in-plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e-field)-induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in-plane actuation is converted into out-of-plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e-field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e-field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported. The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a DE. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Sb2Te3/GeTe Superlattice Film and Its Melt&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Free Phase&#8208;Transition Mechanism for Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ crystallized Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice film is grown by atomic layer deposition on the planar and sidewall memory cell, showing a significantly decreased reset current compared with the homogeneously mixed alloy. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress and effective electromigration of the Ge atoms induce a melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization mechanism.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO2 insulator is demonstrated. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb2Te3 enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of &#8776;1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)&#8208;oriented face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress, induced by the SL&#8208;to&#8208;FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement. Set operation switches the amorphous to the (111)&#8208;oriented FCC structure.

         <title>Polymeric Single&#8208;Ion Conductors with Enhanced Side&#8208;Chain Motion for High&#8208;Performance Solid Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC) based on heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers high ionic conductivity with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number, leading to high&#8208;performance solid zinc batteries.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have enormous potential in realizing high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC)&#8208;based SPEs can largely eradicate anion migration and side reactions of electrodes with decreased polarization, but the ionic conductivity is still unsatisfactory due to the tight localized ion interactions and sluggish chain motion. Herein, by employing the heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain, a novel PSIC is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers an ionic conductivity up to 5.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number of 0.94. Based on the PSIC, dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping cycling (2000&#160;h) is achieved. A further assembled Zn&#8214;V2O5 battery exhibits superior performances to other solid ZIBs, including a high discharge capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life. In addition, a remarkable shelf&#8208;life (90 d), low self&#8208;discharge rate, and good temperature adaptability of the solid battery can be achieved benefiting from the high stability of the SPE during operation. The PSIC&#8208;based SPEs with advanced ion&#8208;transport structure endow solid ZIBs with significant performance improvement, high safety, and durability.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Boosted Imine Cathodes with Extended Conjugated Structure for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been the spotlight in energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety, fast kinetics, and low cost. In this work, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated structure is in situ injected into layered Ti&#8208;based MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. The assembled ZIBs exhibit ultralong cycle stability and display impressive potential for electronic devices.








Abstract
Organic molecules have been considered promising energy&#8208;storage materials in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but are plagued by poor conductivity and structural instability because of the short&#8208;range conjugated structure and low molecular weight. Herein, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated effects along the C&#63742;N backbones is proposed, which is in situ injected into layered MXene to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. Theoretical and electrochemical analyses reveal a selective H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism in TAP, which is ascribed to the steric effect on the availability of active C&#63742;N sites. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx, as a conductive scaffold, favors fast Zn2+ diffusion to boost the electrode kinetics of TAP. Close electronic interactions between TAP and Ti3C2Tx preserve the structural integrity of TAP/Ti3C2Tx during the repeated charge/discharge. Accordingly, the TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 303 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.04 A g&#8722;1 in aqueous ZIBs, which also realizes an ultralong lifetime over 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 81.6%. Furthermore, flexible Zn||TAP/Ti3C2Tx batteries with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrate potential application in wearable electronic devices. This work offers pivotal guidance to create highly stable organic electrodes for advanced ZIBs.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced organic synapse with single&#8208;polarity presynaptic voltage driven facilitation and depression is reported. The device is controlled by the coupling effect in a polyelectrolyte&#8208;electret bilayer. It produces synaptic facilitation by electrochemical doping and depression by electret&#8208;charging. As a result, the device outperforms conventional organic electrochemical synapses with simplified operations and sophisticated functionality.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decade electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.

The device is controlled by the coupling effect in a polyelectrolyte-electret bilayer. It produces synaptic facilitation by electrochemical doping and depression by electret-charging. As a result, the device outperforms conventional organic electrochemical synapses with simplified operations and sophisticated functionality.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decade electrolyte-gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical-electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation-to-depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold-controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude-dependent, dual-modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulate Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized two&#8208;enzyme nanoparticles are constructed using GOx, Mn2+, and HA (GOx&#8208;Mn/HA). GOx&#8208;Mn/HA can target the tumor site and, self&#8208;amplifying, regulate the tumor glycometabolism to cause tumor cell pyroptosis and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression. GOx&#8208;Mn/HA is further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to treat tumors, which can effectively inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. In this work,&#160;regulating tumor glycometabolism is found to induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy is investigated here. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method is used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It has the ability to self&#8208;amplify regulation of the glycometabolism of tumor cells. It can also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, nanoparticles are further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibits tumor development and significantly increases &#160;the survival time of mice. Combination therapy also has a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This is thought to be the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immunocheckpoint blocking in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy can have good prospects in clinical applications.

         <title>In situ Observation of Structural Evolution and Phase Engineering of Amorphous Materials during Crystal Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation from the amorphous phase is probed at the atomic scale through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. Three distinct stages, including aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals, are observed. Unconventional crystal phases, e.g., fcc Ru, hcp Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo, are formed through nucleation from the corresponding amorphous C&#8208;doped metal nanosheets.








Abstract
The nucleation pathway determines the structures and thus properties of formed nanomaterials, which is governed by the free energy of the intermediate phase during nucleation. The amorphous structure, as one of the intermediate phases during nucleation, plays an important role in modulating the nucleation pathway. However, the process and mechanism of crystal nucleation from amorphous structures still need to be fully investigated. Here, in situ aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) is employed to conduct real&#8208;time imaging of the nucleation of ultrathin amorphous nanosheets (NSs). The results indicate that their nucleation contains three distinct stages, i.e., aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals. In particular, the crystallization processes of various amorphous materials are investigated systematically to form corresponding nanocrystals with unconventional crystalline phases, including face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) Ru, hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo alloy. In situ electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis unveils that the doped carbon in the original amorphous NSs can migrate to the surface during the nucleation process, stabilizing the obtained unconventional crystal phases transformed from the amorphous structures, which is also proven by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of using preexisting polymer chains to fabricate hydrogels from doughs is reported. The dough is formed by mixing the polymers with water and photoinitiator. Kneading and annealing then homogenize the dough and entangle the polymers. The polymers are crosslinked and swollen in water to equilibrium. Such a hydrogel resolves the conflict between swell&#8208;resistance and toughness, while having near&#8208;perfect elasticity.








Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with two widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Multifunctional 4D&#8208;Printed Sperm&#8208;Hybrid Microcarriers for Assisted Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D&#8208;printed microcarriers are developed to perform various functions, including multiple sperm cargo&#8208;release, local sperm capacitation, and mediation of cumulus&#8211;oocyte complex removal by in situ enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Remotely controllable microrobots are appealing for various biomedical in vivo applications. In particular, in recent years, our&#160;group has focused on developing sperm&#8208;microcarriers to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies or low sperm count (two of the most prominent male infertility problems) to reach the oocyte toward in&#8208;vivo&#8208;assisted fertilization. Different sperm carriers, considering their motion in realistic media and confined environments, have been optimized. However, the already&#8208;reported sperm carriers have been mainly designed to transport single sperm cell, with limited functionality. Thus, to take a step forward, here, the development of a 4D&#8208;printed multifunctional microcarrier containing soft and smart materials is reported. These microcarriers can not only transport and deliver multiple motile sperm cells, but also release heparin and mediate local enzymatic reactions by hyaluronidase&#8208;loaded polymersomes (HYAL&#8208;Psomes). These multifunctional facets enable in situ sperm capacitation/hyperactivation, and the local degradation of the cumulus complex that surrounds the oocyte, both to facilitate the sperm&#8211;oocyte interaction for the ultimate goal of in vivo assisted fertilization.

         <title>Activating C&#8211;H Bonds by Tuning Fe Sites and an Interfacial Effect for Enhanced Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (NTAs) photoanode is developed for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The superiority of the co&#8208;edged FeO6 octahedral structure in the Formox process is demonstrated. Impressively, the heterostructure and the interfacial effect of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 and CoFe2O4 facilitates the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, resulting in superior PEC methanol conversion efficiency and formaldehyde selectivity.








Abstract
The interaction mechanism between the reacting species and the active site of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;based photoanodes in photoelectrochemical methanol conversion reaction is still ambiguous. Herein, a simple two&#8208;step strategy is demonstrated to fabricate a porous &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 heterojunction for the methanol conversion reaction. The influence of the electronic structure of active site and interfacial effect on the reaction are investigated by constructing two different FeO6 octahedral configurations and heterogeneous structures. The optimal sample ZnFeCo&#8208;2 affords high photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 3.2 times than that of ZnFe (0.37 mA cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the ZnFeCo&#8208;2 also exhibits 97.8% Faraday efficiency of CH3OH to HCHO, and long&#8208;term stability over 40 h. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the heterostructured &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 with favorable electron transfer effectively lowers methanol adsorption, C&#8211;H bond activation, and HCHO desorption energy relative to the pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, resulting in excellent methanol conversion efficiency.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are developed by designing a new series of polymer donors (PDs, PhAm) featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable flexible spacers. High power conversion efficiency (PCE = 12.7%) and stretchability (PCE retention of &gt; 80% at 32% strain) are demonstrated, which represent the best performances in terms of both PCE and stretchability among the IS&#8208;OSCs reported to date.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (N1,N3&#8208;bis((5&#8208;bromothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)isophthalamide, PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions is developed. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention of &gt;80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. It is also found that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

Organic Solar Cells
In article number 2207544, Jung&#8208;Yong Lee, Bumjoon J. Kim, and co&#8208;workers report the development of efficient and intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), by designing new polymer donors featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable spacers. The use of the new polymer donors significantly enhances the stretchability of the active layers, and the resulting IS&#8208;OSCs, maintain 86% of the initial efficiency after 100 cycles of stretching/releasing under 15% strain.

To investigate the mechanism of the  coedge/coplanar FeO6 structure for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube array structures are designed by Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu and co&#8208;workers, as reported in article number 2208438. Benefiting from the special electronic structure of the coedge active FeO6 site and the interfacial effect of the heterojunction, the obtained CoFe2O4/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 demonstrates favorable performance for the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde.

         <title>Stabilization of Perovskite Solar Cells: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The roles of electrode materials and interfaces in perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices are discussed&#160;in terms of perovskite stability. The various factors responsible for rapid degradation in PSCs are provided. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials for carbon&#8208;based PSC as a substitute for noble metals are addressed, along with the recent progress.








Abstract
Exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved, which is comparable with their traditional rivals (Si&#8208;based solar cells). However, commercialization&#8208;worthy efficiency and long&#8208;term stability remain a challenge. In this regard, there are increasing studies focusing on the interface engineering in PSC devices to overcome their poor technical readiness. Herein, the roles of electrode materials and interfaces in PSCs are discussed in terms of their PCEs and perovskite stability. All the current knowledge on the factors responsible for the rapid intrinsic and external degradation of PSCs is presented. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials as substitutes for noble metals are focused on, along with the recent research progress in carbon&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a sub&#8208;category of PSCs, that is, flexible PSCs, is considered as a type of exceptional power source due to their high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and figures of merit for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. Last, the future perspectives and directions for research in PSCs are discussed, with an emphasis on their commercialization.

         <title>Understanding of Oxygen Redox in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of oxygen redox in lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. Meanwhile, the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction on metal oxides is interpreted and perspectives on the future development of LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often either proceeds solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike the AEM, the LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen (O&#63743;O) bond. As a result, such a process is able to bypass the rate&#8208;determining step, that is, O&#63743;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM&#8208;based catalysts are able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM&#8208;based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.

Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM-based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM-induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>

Abstract
Glutathione&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular glutathione (GSH) enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, we show a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumor and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8764; 0.12&#160;mM for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin at tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance and surgical guidance.

         <title>Realising highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal capability through the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect using two&#8208;dimensional catalytic planar defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. We herein design two&#8208;dimensional (2D) catalytic planar defects within Ti3C2 sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species [Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)] can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2 generation and the 99.72% &#177; 0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. We discover that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene electron transfer through the phonon drag effect &#8211; a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons &#8211; that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2 activation energy from 1.65 to 0.06&#160;eV. Our design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, we reveal that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2 activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coated with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10 reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) have been routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide band gap organic cations. Here we report the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;). By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation has been developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs have been fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;red Light&#8208;emitting Diodes Based on a Lateral 0D/3D perovskite Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bright and efficient deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep&#8208;red photons into human tissues. Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite&#8208;based deep&#8208;red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites or trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination in three&#8208;dimensional perovskites. Here, we demonstrate a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8208;xPbI3 (zero&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional, 0D/3D) heterostructure, which can enable efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness. The Cs4PbI6 can facilitate the growth of low&#8208;defect FAxCs1&#8208;xPbI3, and act as low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. Our device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;1021 m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high efficiency deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs. Our LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Anti&#8208;Glycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A new anti&#8208;cancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported herein. An anti&#8208;glycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anti&#8208;cancer drugs.

An anti-glycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC-PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anti-cancer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Light&#8208;fueled Non&#8208;reciprocal Self&#8208;oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>

Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, we report an optically powered soft material strip that can perform non&#8208;reciprocal, self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield non&#8208;reciprocal strokes. The non&#8208;reciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. We demonstrate autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction. The results can offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, we&#160;report electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe. In particular, we&#160;demonstrate that the strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe creates a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we&#160;have successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. Our&#160;results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Ultrahigh Strain&#8208;Insensitive Integrated Hybrid Electronics Using Highly Stretchable Bilayer Liquid Metal Based Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive hybrid integrated electronics constructed by a self&#8208;formed amphiphilic bilayer highly stretchable conductor is reported based on liquid metal composite and peeling strategy. The amphiphilic bilayer conductor can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics, anchor well with substrates, and shows ultrahigh conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healability, and interconnect functions. The unique materials hold the potential for strain&#8208;resilient integrated bioelectronics and wearables.








Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties is introduced to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22&#160;532&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), extreme stretchability (2260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8776;200&#160;&#181;m. It is demonstrated that it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

Probiotic&#8208;inspired drug&#8208;free nanomedicine ameliorates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by restoring redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Microbiota&#8208;based therapeutics offer innovative strategies to treat inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, the poor clinical outcome so far and the limited flexibility of the bacterial approach call for improvement. Inspired by the health benefits of probiotics in alleviating symptoms of bowel diseases, bioartificial probiotics are designed to restore the intestinal microenvironment in colitis by regulating redox balance, immune responses, and the gut microbiome. The bioartificial probiotic comprises two components: an E. coli Nissle 1917&#8208;derived membrane (EM) as the surface and the biodegradable diselenide&#8208;bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SeM) as the core. When orally administered, the probiotic&#8208;inspired nanomedicine (SeM@EM) adheres strongly to the mucus layer and restored intestinal redox balance and immune regulation homeostasis in a murine model of acute colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate. In addition, the respective properties of the EM and SeM synergistically alter the gut microbiome to a favorable state by increasing the bacterial diversity and shifting the microbiome profile to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. This work suggests a safe and effective nanomedicine that can restore intestinal homeostasis for IBDs therapy.

         <title>Orbital Interactions between the Organic Semiconductor Spacer and the Inorganic Layer in Dion&#8211;Jacobson Perovskites Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semiconductor spacer, namely bithiophenedimethylamine (BThDMA), is successfully developed for 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and high photovoltaic performance is demonstrated. An important finding is that there are strong orbital interactions between the conjugated organic spacer and the adjacent inorganic layers, whereas no such interactions exist in DJ perovskites using an insulating aliphatic spacer with similar length.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites have become emerging photovoltaic materials owing to their intrinsic structure stability. However, as insulating aliphatic cations are widely used as spacers, the interactions between the spacers and inorganic layers in DJ perovskites have rarely been studied. Here, an organic semiconductor spacer with two covalently connected thiophene rings, namely bithiophene dimethylammonium (BThDMA), is successfully developed for 2D DJ perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An important finding is that there are strong orbital interactions between the conjugated organic spacer and adjacent inorganic layers, whereas no such interactions exist in DJ perovskite using an aliphatic octane&#8208;1,8&#8208;diaminium (ODA) spacer with similar length. The BThDMA spacer with multiple conjugated aromatic rings can also induce crystal growth with large grain size and preferred vertical orientation, resulting in reduced trap density and improved charge&#8208;carrier mobility. As a result, the optimized device based on (BThDMA)MAn&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (nominal n&#160;= 5) shows an excellent PCE of 18.1% with negligible hysteresis, which is a record efficiency for 2D DJ PSCs using a spacer with two or more covalently linked aromatic rings. These findings provide a novel and important insight on achieving efficient and stable 2D DJ perovskite solar cells by developing organic semiconductor spacers.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water electrolysis is one of the most efficient and environmentally benign methods for the hydrogen production using renewable but intermittent power sources. The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency and higher gas purity. However, the PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Many OER electrocatalysts are prone to dissolution and/or surface structure transformation under the oxidizing OER potentials in the harsh acidic environment, finally leading to a drastic decrease of catalytic performance. In this review, we comprehensively summarize, classify and discuss the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for the OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. We also discuss some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzer. Finally, the suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

         <title>Memristive Field&#8208;Programmable Analog Arrays for Analog Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) is the analog counterpart of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). FPAA can be used to quickly prototyping analog circuit designs and greatly enhance analog computing development. A memristor based FPAA (memFPAA) has been demonstrated in this work with memristive devices and arrays serving as multiple core analog components, ranging from programmable analog resistors, routing networks, and analog vector&#8208;matrix multipliers.








Abstract
The increasing interests in analog computing nowadays call for multipurpose analog computing platforms with reconfigurability. The advancement of analog computing, enabled by novel electronic elements like memristors, has shown its potential to sustain the exponential growth of computing demand in the new era of analog data deluge. Here, a platform of a memristive field&#8208;programmable analog array (memFPAA) is experimentally demonstrated with memristive devices serving as a variety of core analog elements and CMOS components as peripheral circuits. The memFPAA is reconfigured to implement a first&#8208;order band pass filter, an audio equalizer, and an acoustic mixed frequency classifier, as application examples. The memFPAA, featured with programmable analog memristors, memristive routing networks, and memristive vector&#8208;matrix multipliers, opens opportunities for fast prototyping analog designs as well as efficient analog applications in signal processing and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Visualization of Tunable Weyl Line in A&#8211;A Stacking Kagome Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work provides the spectroscopic evidence of 3D Weyl lines in Mn&#8208;based kagome magnets with the systematic angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiment. Interestingly, the bandgap and binding energies of the Weyl lines can be tuned through cation engineering, which demonstrate the system as a promising platform for realizing controllable and robust 3D quantum devices.








Abstract
Kagome magnets provide a fascinating platform for a plethora of topological quantum phenomena, in which the delicate interplay between frustrated crystal structure, magnetization, and spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC) can engender highly tunable topological states. Here, utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the Weyl lines are directly visualized with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dispersion in the A&#8211;A stacked kagome magnet GdMn6Sn6. Remarkably, the Weyl lines exhibit a strong magnetization&#8208;direction&#8208;tunable SOC gap and binding energy tunability after substituting Gd with Tb and Li, respectively. These results not only illustrate the magnetization direction and valence counting as efficient tuning knobs for realizing and controlling distinct 3D topological phases, but also demonstrate AMn6Sn6 (A = rare earth, or Li, Mg, or Ca) as a versatile material family for exploring diverse emergent topological quantum responses.

Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure and easy to functionalized structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8722;effect transistors (OFETs), organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>Modulating the Site Density of Mo Single Atoms to Catch Adventitious O Atoms for Efficient H2O2 Oxidation with Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mo single atoms (SAs) on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) catch the adventitious O atoms in air, forming the O coordination around SAs. The site density of O&#8208;Covered Mo&#8208;SAs can be modulated by the dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts. Such O coordination of Mo&#8208;SAs endows RPCN surface with the enrich electrons under irradiation, promoting the advanced oxidation process with photocatalytic H2O2 decomposition.








Abstract
Coordination environment and site density have great impacts on the catalytic performance for single atoms (SAs). Herein, the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs on red polymeric carbon nitrides (RPCN) is modulated via a local carbonization strategy to controllably catch adventitious O atoms from open environment. The addition of melamine derivants with hydrocarbyl chains induces local carbonization during RPCN pyrolysis. These local carbonization regions bring abundant graphitic N3C to anchor Mo&#8208;SAs, and most of Mo&#8208;SAs catch the O atoms in air, forming the O2&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;N3 coordination. The dopants of carbon source with different structures and amounts can modulate the site density of Mo&#8208;SAs, therefore controlling the amounts of coordinated O atoms. Furthermore, coordinated O atoms around Mo&#8208;SAs construct the catalytic environment with Lewis base and gather photo&#8208;generated electrons under light. Such O&#8208;covered Mo&#8208;SAs endow RPCN materials (Mo&#8208;RPCN) with a strong ability for hydrogen abstraction, leading to the 99.51% ratio (28.8&#160;mmol&#160;min&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1) rate for thioanisole conversion with H2O2 assisted advance oxidation technology. This work brings a new sight on the coordinated atoms dominant oxidation process.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Ultra&#8208;Robust MoS2 Patterns Directly Synthesized on Polymer Substrate for Flexible Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining inkjet printing and thermal annealing, large&#8208;area patterned MoS2 are directly synthesized on polymer substrates without photolithography patterning and transferring process. The resultant MoS2 films exhibit superior mechanical durability (&#8776;2% variation in resistance over 10,000 bending cycles), as well as excellent chemical stability. Also, temperature and biopotential signals are continuously recorded with MoS2&#8208;based sensors even under folding conditions.








Abstract
Synthesis of large&#8208;area patterned MoS2 is considered the principle base for realizing high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based flexible electronic devices. Patterning and transferring MoS2 films to target flexible substrates, however, require conventional multi&#8208;step photolithography patterning and transferring process, despite tremendous progress in the facilitation of practical applications. Herein, an approach to directly synthesize large&#8208;scale MoS2 patterns that combines inkjet printing and thermal annealing is reported. An optimal precursor ink is prepared that can deposit arbitrary patterns on polyimide films. By introducing a gas atmosphere of argon/hydrogen (Ar/H2), thermal treatment at 350&#160;&#176;C enables an in situ decomposition and crystallization in the patterned precursors and, consequently, results in the formation of MoS2. Without complicated processes, patterned MoS2 is obtained directly on polymer substrate, exhibiting superior mechanical flexibility and durability (&#8776;2% variation in resistance over 10,000 bending cycles), as well as excellent chemical stability, which is attributed to the generated continuous and thin microstructures, as well as their strong adhesion with the substrate. As a step further, this approach is employed to manufacture various flexible sensing devices that are insensitive to body motions and moisture, including temperature sensors and biopotential sensing systems for real&#8208;time, continuously monitoring skin temperature, electrocardiography, and electromyography signals.

         <title>Ultralong Lifetime of Plasmon&#8208;Excited Electrons Realized in Nonepitaxial/Epitaxial Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 Triple&#8208;Heteronanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to effectively extract the energetic electrons from plasmonic metal and prolong their lifetimes is a daunting challenge for plasmon&#8208;assisted chemistry. Here, it is demonstrated that in contrast to Au/CsPbBr3 directly connected system showing severe plasmon&#8208;exciton suppression, Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 ternary heteronanocrystals with judiciously engineered interfaces enable to leverage the exceptional hot carrier dynamics of halide perovskite and acquire ultralong&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;excited electrons.








Abstract
Combination of the strong light&#8208;absorbing power of plasmonic metals with the superior charge carrier dynamics of halide perovskites is appealing for bio&#8208;inspired solar&#8208;energy conversion due to the potential to acquire long&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;induced hot electrons. However, the direct coupling of these two materials, with Au/CsPbBr3 heteronanocrystals (HNCs) as a prototype, results in severe suppression of plasmon resonances. The present work shows that interfacial engineering is a key knob for overcoming this impediment, based on the creation of a CdS mediate layer between Au and CsPbBr3 forming atomically organized Au&#8208;CdS and CdS&#8208;CsPbBr3 interfaces by nonepitaxial/epitaxial combined strategy. Transient spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the resulting Au@CdS/CsPbBr3 HNCs generate remarkably long&#8208;lived plasmon&#8208;induced charge carriers with lifetime up to nanosecond timescale, which is several orders of magnitude longer than those reported for colloidal plasmonic metal&#8208;semiconductor systems. Such long&#8208;lived carriers extracted from plasmonic antennas enable to drive CO2 photoreduction with efficiency outperforming previously reported CsPbBr3&#8208;based photocatalysts. The findings disclose a new paradigm for achieving much elongated time windows to harness the substantial energy of transient plasmons through realization of synergistic coupling of plasmonic metals and halide perovskites.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set and reset&#8212;have been clearly revealed for the first time by three&#8208;dimensional (3D) reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM)images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs have been successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Emerging Halide Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites have gained tremendous attention in the past decade owing to their excellent properties in optoelectronics. Recently, a fascinating property, ferroelectricity, has been discovered in halide perovskites and quickly attracted widespread interest. Compared with traditional perovskite oxide ferroelectrics, halide perovskites display natural advantages such as structural softness, low weight, and easy processing, which are highly desirable in applications pursuing miniaturization and flexibility. This review focuses on the current research progress in halide perovskite ferroelectrics, encompassing the emerging materials systems and their potential applications in ferroelectric photovoltaics, self&#8208;powered photodetection, and X&#8208;ray detection. We also attempt to point out the main challenges and possible solutions in the future development of halide perovskite ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Bone&#8208;Adhesive Anisotropic Tough Hydrogel Mimicking Tendon Enthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong adhesive triple&#8208;network hydrogel consisting of ionically cross&#8208;linked alginate, polyacrylamide, and adhesive imidazole&#8208;containing polyaspartamide derivatives subjected to stretching&#8208;mediated linear remodeling followed by cross&#8208;linking exhibits strong mechanical properties and high adhesiveness. The hydrogel exhibits an anisotropic structure similar to that of tendons. The proposed hydrogel is promising for the development of artificial tendons and clinical applications.








Abstract
Tendon consists of soft collagen, yet it is mechanically strong and firmly adhered to the bone owing to its hierarchically anisotropic structure and unique tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone integration (enthesis), respectively. Despite the recent advances in biomaterials, hydrogels simultaneously providing tendon&#8208;like high mechanical properties and strong adhesion to bone&#8208;mimicking enthesis is still challenging. Here, a strong, stiff, and adhesive triple&#8208;network (TN) anisotropic hydrogel that mimics a bone&#8208;adhering tendon is shown. The tough adhesive TN hydrogel is developed by combining imidazole&#8208;containing polyaspartamide (providing multiple hydrogen bonds to the bone surface) and energy&#8208;dissipative alginate&#8211;polyacrylamide double&#8208;network. To mimic the anisotropic structure and high mechanical properties of tendons, the bone&#8208;adhered TN hydrogel is linearly stretched and subsequently fixed via secondary cross&#8208;linking. The resulting hydrogel exhibits high tensile modulus and strength while maintaining a high bone adhesion without chemical modification of the bone surface. Furthermore, a bone&#8211;ligament&#8211;bone structure with strong bone adhesion reminiscent of the natural ligament is realized.

Highly efficient and stable flexible inverted perovskite solar cells are developed through modifying the interface between perovskite and hole transport layer via pentylammonium acetate molecule, which achieve a record power conversion efficiency of&#160;23.68% (0.08 cm2, certified: 23.35%) and excellent mechanical stability.








Abstract
Among the emerging photovoltaic technologies, rigid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have made tremendous development owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to&#160;25.7%. However, the record PCE of flexible PSCs (&#8776;22.4%) still lags far behind their rigid counterparts and their mechanical stabilities are also not satisfactory. Herein, through modifying the interface between perovskite and hole transport layer via pentylammonium acetate (PenAAc) molecule a highly efficient and stable flexible inverted PSC is reported. Through synthetic manipulation of anion and cation, it is shown that the PenA+ and Ac&#8722; have strong chemical binding with both acceptor and donor defects of surface&#8208;terminating ends on perovskite films. The PenAAc&#8208;modified flexible PSCs achieve a record PCE of&#160;23.68% (0.08 cm2, certified: 23.35%) with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of&#160;1.17&#160;V. Large&#8208;area devices (1.0 cm2) also realized an exceptional PCE of&#160;21.52%. Moreover, the fabricated devices show excellent stability under mechanical bending, with PCE remaining above&#160;91% of the original PCE even after&#160;5000 bends.

         <title>Zwitterions Narrow Distribution of Perovskite Quantum Wells for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 15%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a facile strategy base on bifunctional zwitterions is proposed that effectively modulates the crystallization kinetics of quantum wells&#8212;both suppressing the formation of low&#8208;n phases and restricting the growth of high&#8208;n phases&#8212;contributing to a narrow n distribution. Accordingly, high&#8208;performance sky&#8208;blue PeLEDs at 490&#160;nm with a recorded EQE of 15.6% are realized.








Abstract
While quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have emerged as promising semiconductors for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), the broad&#8208;width distribution of quantum wells hinders their efficient energy transfer and electroluminescence performance in blue emission. In particular, the underlying mechanism is closely related to the crystallization kinetics and has yet to be understood. Here for the first time, the influence of bifunctional zwitterions with different coordination affinity on the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites is systematically investigated. The zwitterions can coordinate with Pb2+ and also act as co&#8208;spacer organic species in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which collectively inhibit the aggregation of colloidal precursors and shorten the distance of quantum wells. Consequently, restricted nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and promoted growth of low&#8208;n phases are achieved with moderately coordinated zwitterions, leading to the final film with a more concentrated n distribution and improved energy transfer efficiency. It thus enables high&#8208;efficiency blue LEDs with a recorded external quantum efficiency of 15.6% at 490&#160;nm, and the operation stability has also been prolonged to 55.3&#160;min. These results provide useful directions for tuning the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which is expected to lead to high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectrally overlapping mid&#8208;gap emitters from deterministically positioned, nanoparticle&#8208;strained WSe2 monolayers are converted into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched emitters using electron beam irradiation. The localized emission before and after irradiation are compared as a function of strain magnitude to assign the spectral transformation to the suppression of weakly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs through strongly coupled mid&#8208;gap state&#8208;strain pairs introduced through electron beam irradiation.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes are employed to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior. The findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well&#8208;defined energy range.

         <title>In Situ Encapsulated Moir&#233; Perovskite for Stable Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Polarization Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to its enhanced light collection ability, the Moir&#233;&#8208;lattice&#8208;structured perovskite photodetectors (PDs) in situ encapsulated by two nano&#8208;grating&#8208;structured Polydimethylsiloxane show a responsivity up to 1026.5&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. The PD still maintained 95% performance after exposure to air for 233 days. The Moir&#233;&#8208;lattice structures endow the PD a dichroism ratio of up to 9.1.








Abstract
Nanostructures provide a simple, effective, and low&#8208;cost route to enhance the light&#8208;trapping capability of optoelectronic devices. In recent years, nano&#8208;optical structures have been widely used in perovskite optoelectronic devices to greatly enhance the device performance. However, the inherent instability of perovskite materials hinders the practical application of these nanostructured optoelectronic devices. Here, in situ encapsulated moir&#233; lattice perovskite photodetectors (PDs) by two nanograting&#8208;structured soft templates with relative rotation angles is fabricated. The confinement growth of the two nanograting templates leads to crystal growth with moir&#233; lattice structure, which improves the light&#8208;harvesting ability of the perovskite crystal, thereby improving the device performance. The PD&#160;exhibits responsivity to 1026.5&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1. The Moir&#233; lattice&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based PD maintained 95% of the initial performance after 223&#160;days. After being continuously sprayed with water moist for 180&#160;min, the performance is maintained at 95.7% of its initial level. The nanograting structure endows the device with high polarization sensitivity of Imax/Imin as high as 9.1.

         <title>A Materials Acceleration Platform for Organic Laser Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The accelerated discovery of two molecules with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic laser performance from screening 40&#160;candidates is made possible by the introduction of an automated platform encompassing automated synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be run fully end&#8208;to&#8208;end. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and accelerated discovery of materials.








Abstract
Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time&#8208;consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, an automated platform is introduced for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. This platform encompasses automated lego&#8208;like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end&#8208;to&#8208;end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, discovered eight potential candidates for organic lasers is discovered. The lasing threshold of four molecules in thin&#8208;film devices and find two molecules with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance is tested. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.

In this work, an automated platform is introduced for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. This platform encompasses automated lego-like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end-to-end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, discovered eight potential candidates for organic lasers is discovered. The lasing threshold of four molecules in thin-film devices and find two molecules with state-of-the-art performance is tested. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;state Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultra&#8208;long intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA as well as high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, we strategically develop a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) for in&#8208;situ crosslinking of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering, improved electrical conductivity as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41&#160;eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibited competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 hours, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Roughness&#8208;Induced Plasticity in a Biodegradable Zn Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) solves the dilemma of significantly improving plasticity at the expense of strength. From the unground state to the 5000# sandpaper ground state, room&#8208;temperature elongation of biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy increases from 74% to 143% without loss of strength. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness.








Abstract
Improving plasticity has been an eternal theme of developing metallic materials. It is difficult to increase room&#8208;temperature elongation of metallic materials over 100% without sacrificing strength using existing methods. Herein, surface&#8208;roughness&#8208;induced plasticity (SRIP) is discovered in biodegradable Zn&#8211;0.4Mn alloy. Surprisingly, in the good surface range that meets the international standard ISO 6892, reducing surface roughness results in significant increase in plasticity without loss of strength. From unground to 5000# sandpaper ground states, the surface roughness Ra of the alloy decreases from 0.63 to 0.05&#160;&#181;m, while its room temperature elongation increases from 74% to 143%. SRIP is the synergistic result of increased microstructure damage tolerance and decreased surface roughness. It provides a new method for improving plasticity.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Thin&#8208;Film Lithium Niobate Microrings Fabricated with Wet Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wet etching method is developed for thin&#8208;film lithium niobate (TFLN), leading to the fabrication of a micro&#8208;racetrack with an intrinsic quality factor over 9 million. This method features a high throughput, a high reproducibility, and a low cost in etching TFLN, showing the potential to boost the mass production of integrated TFLN devices with high fidelity and affordability dramatically.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film lithium niobate (TFLN) has been widely used in electro&#8208;optic modulators, acoustic&#8208;&#8211;optic modulators, electro&#8208;optic frequency combs, and nonlinear wavelength converters owing to the excellent optical properties of lithium niobate. The performance of these devices is highly dependent on the fabrication quality of TFLN. Although state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TFLN microrings with an intrinsic quality factor (Q&#8208;factor) exceeding 1 &#215; 107 have been realized by inductively coupled plasma&#8211;reactive ion etching (ICP&#8208;RIE) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), ICP&#8208;RIE has moderate throughput, moderate reproducibility, and high cost in etching TFLN, while CMP features moderate throughput and low cost in etching TFLN. Here, a wet etching method for TFLN, leading to the fabrication of a micro&#8208;racetrack with an intrinsic Q&#8208;factor of over 9.27 &#215; 106 is developed. The suitability of this method to fabricate a narrow coupling gap between the bus waveguide and microring enables the coupling conditions of the microring to be customized. This method features a high throughput, a high reproducibility, and a low cost in etching TFLN, showing the potential to boost the mass production of integrated LN photonic devices with high fidelity and affordability&#160;dramatically.

Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially&#8208;aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li /Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptional long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8208;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater for the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion battery owing to low&#8208;cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating/stripping. Consequently, 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1,400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776; 99.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1,600 cycles. This study brings inspired universality pathway to rapidly fabricate reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8764;1&#8208;2 minutes) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5 minutes), which was supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8764;1&#8208;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#956;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. The fabrication of hinges represents a possible use&#8208;case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Magnetically Powered Spiky Nanomachines with Thermal Control of Viscosity for Enhanced Cancer Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanomachines with active propulsion have emerged as an intelligent platform for targeted cancer therapy. Achieving an efficient locomotion performance using an external energy conversion is a key requirement in the design of nanomachines. In this study, inspired by diverse spiky structures in nature, we proposed a photo&#8208;magnetically powered nanomachine (PMN) with a spiky surface and thermal&#8208;dependent viscosity tunability to facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for cancer mechanotherapy. The hybrid nanomachine was integrated with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and covered with gold nanotips. The physical simulations and experimental results proved that the spiky structure endows nanomachines with an obvious photo&#8208;magnetic coupling effect in the NIR&#8208;II region through the alignment and orienting movement of plasmons on the gold tips. Using a coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic field, PMNs are efficiently assembled into chain&#8208;like structures to further elevate energy conversion efficiency. Notably, PMNs with the thermal control of viscosity were efficiently propelled under simultaneously&#8208;applied dual external energy sources in cell lysosomes. Enhanced mechanical destruction of cancer cells via PMNs was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo under photo&#8208;magnetic treatment. This study provides a new direction for designing integrated nanomachines with active adaptability to physiological environments for cancer treatment.

         <title>Direct CO2 capture by alkali&#8208;dissolved cellulose and sequestration in building materials and artificial reef structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, we offer an effective pathway that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107 mPa s and storage modulus from 10 to 105 Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5 gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, we present a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, our Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52 A W&#8722;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34 &#215; 1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector was integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. Our work paves the avenue towards constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Refining Perovskite Heterojunctions for Effective Light&#8208;Emitting Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;heterojunction refinement strategy with wide&#8208;bandgap salts is used to engineer the bottom interfaces and the top interfaces associated with a perovskite. The double&#8208;heterojunction refinement allows both efficient light&#8208;harvesting through a photovoltaic response and light&#8208;emission under ultralow bias in the same device. By connecting to an electric battery, a multifunctional harvesting&#8211;storage&#8211;utilization system is realized.








Abstract
Solar cells capable of light&#8208;harvesting during daytime and light&#8208;emission at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications. Here, it is reported that halide perovskite heterojunction interfaces can be refined to yield stable and efficient solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;A double-heterojunction refinement strategy with wide-bandgap salts is used to engineer the bottom interfaces and the top interfaces associated with a perovskite. The double-heterojunction refinement allows both efficient light-harvesting through a photovoltaic response and light-emission under ultralow bias in the same device. By connecting to an electric battery, a multifunctional harvesting&#8211;storage&#8211;utilization system is realized.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar cells capable of light-harvesting during daytime and light-emission at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications. Here, it is reported that halide perovskite heterojunction interfaces can be refined to yield stable and efficient solar cells. The cell can also operate effectively as an ultralow-voltage light-emitting diode (LED) with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of electroluminescence (EQE&lt;sub&gt;EL&lt;/sub&gt;)&#160;of 3.3%. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies reveal that double-heterojunction refinement with wide-bandgap salts is key to densifying the packing of perovskite grains and enlarging the bandgaps of the perovskite surfaces that are in contact with charge-transport semiconductors. The refined perovskite enables a simple device with dual actions of solar cells and LEDs.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, we introduce a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, we can maintain the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area. Our findings will open a new route towards the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, we comprehensively group the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit into three categories: (1) directly bridging one molecule&#8208;electrode component with another electrode, (2) physically bridging two molecule&#8208;electrode components, and (3) chemically bridging two molecule&#8208;electrode components. Finally, we discuss the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization and provide our perspectives, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Transcranial Nongenetic Neuromodulation via Bioinspired Vesicle&#8208;Enabled Precise NIR&#8208;II Optical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcranial nongenetic biological modulation via nanovesicle&#8208;enabled precise second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) optical&#8208;stimulation is presented. The bioinspired vesicles obtained from membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions can mediate NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli to elicit neuronal signaling dynamics and evoke defined neural circuits. Eliminating implants and integrating brain&#8208;imaging techniques, the vesicle&#8208;enabled multimodal NIR&#8208;II neurostimulation allows behavioral modulation of nontransgenic organisms with minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution.








Abstract
Regulating the activity of specific neurons is essentially important in neurocircuit dissection and neuropathy therapy. As a recently developed strategy, nanomaterial&#8208;enabled nongenetic neuromodulations that realize remote physical stimuli have made vast progress and shown great clinical potential. However, minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution are still challenging for nongenetic neuromodulation. Herein, a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#8208;light&#8208;induced transcranial nongenetic neurostimulation via bioinspired nanovesicles is reported. The rationally designed vesicles are obtained from vesicle&#8208;membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions. This study demonstrates that the vesicle&#8208;enabled NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli can elicit neuronal signaling dynamics with precise spatiotemporal control and thus evoke defined neural circuits in nontransgenic mice. Moreover, the vesicle&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II optical stimulation can regulate mouse motor behaviors with minimal invasiveness by eliminating light&#8208;emitting implants. Furthermore, the biological modulation is integrated with photoacoustic brain imaging, realizing navigational, and efficient neuromodulation. Such transcranial and precise NIR&#8208;II optical neuromodulation mediated by bioinspired vesicles shows the potential for the optical&#8208;theranostics of neurological diseases in nontransgenic organisms.

         <title>Ferrielectricity in the Archetypal Antiferroelectric, PbZrO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging highly oriented thin films, a ferrielectric phase is observed in PbZrO3 at room temperature and low field. Ferrielectricity is observed in modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields, and is qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlates with high dielectric tunability and large strains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials, where the transition between antipolar and polar phase is controlled by external electric fields, offer exceptional energy storage capacity with high efficiencies, giant electrocaloric effect, and superb electromechanical response. PbZrO3 is the first discovered and the archetypal antiferroelectric material. Nonetheless, substantial challenges in processing phase pure PbZrO3 have limited studies of the undoped composition, hindering understanding of the phase transitions in this material or unraveling the controversial origins of a low&#8208;field ferroelectric phase observed in lead zirconate thin films. Leveraging highly oriented PbZrO3 thin films, a room&#8208;temperature ferrielectric phase is observed in the absence of external electric fields, with modulations of amplitude and direction of the spontaneous polarization and large anisotropy for critical electric fields required for phase transition. The ferrielectric state observations are qualitatively consistent with theoretical predictions, and correlate with very high dielectric tunability, and ultrahigh strains (up to 1.1%). This work suggests a need for re&#8208;evaluation of the fundamental science of antiferroelectricity in this archetypal&#160;material.

         <title>Taming Solvent&#8211;Solute Interaction Accelerates Interfacial Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Desolvation is validated as the predominant contributor to energy loss at low temperatures, largely overwhelming the contributions from other interfacial ion transportation processes. A rational and original design by taming solvent&#8211;solute interaction with low&#8208;affinity solvents like 1,3&#8208;dioxolane is proposed to enable high capacity and durable operation of practical lithium&#8208;metal batteries at &#8722;40 &#176;C.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal batteries promise energy density beyond 400 Wh kg&#8722;1, while their practical operation at an extreme temperature below &#8722;30 &#176;C suffers severe capacity deterioration. Such battery failure highly relates to the remarkably increased kinetic barrier of interfacial processes, including interfacial desolvation, ion transportation, and charge transfer. In this work, the interfacial kinetics in three prototypical electrolytes are quantitatively probed by three&#8208;electrode electrochemical techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Desolvation as the limiting step of interfacial processes is validated to dominate the cell impedance and capacity at low temperature. 1,3&#8208;Dioxolane&#8208;based electrolyte with tamed solvent&#8211;solute interaction facilitates fast desolvation, enabling the practical Li|LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells at &#8722;40 &#176;C to retain 66% of room&#8208;temperature capacity and withstand remarkably fast charging rate (0.3 C). The barrier of desolvation dictated by solvent&#8211;solute interaction environments is quantitatively uncovered. Regulating the solvent&#8211;solute interaction by low&#8208;affinity solvents emerges as a promising solution to low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <dc:description>
Efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are achieved by introducing multifunctional organic halide salts to treat perovskite films, which can facilitate halide exchange and passivate defects of 3D perovskites. The LEDs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.6% and a luminance of &#8776;1680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), close to the Rec.&#160;2020 blue standard.








Abstract
3D perovskites are promising to achieve efficient and bright deep&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which are required for lighting and display applications. However, the efficiency of deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskite&#8208;based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep&#8208;blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions. Here, an in situ halide exchange method is developed to achieve deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskites by spin&#8208;coating an organic halide salts solution to treat blue 3D perovskites. It is revealed that the halide&#8208;exchange process is mainly determined by halide ion diffusion targeting a concentration equalization, which leads to homogeneous 3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. By further introducing multifunctional organic ammonium halide salts into the exchange solution to passivate defects, high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue perovskites with reduced trap density can be obtained. This approach leads to efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, and blue perovskite LEDs can be achieved with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling as the precursors, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation under ambient conditions. The liquid precursor allowed easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantages of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene could be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8764;15 wt%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes was demonstrated via a selective in&#8208;situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the highly structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects showed an electrical conductivity of 4380 S/m and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components

         <title>Atomically Flat, 2D Edge&#8208;Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically flat, 2D&#160;edge directed self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers are demonstrated as sub&#8208;10 nm nanopatterns that are remarkably well&#8208;aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, and they are readily exploited for nanoscale shape engineering of 2D materials. The resultant highly aligned sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;wide graphene nanoribbon exhibits superior switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio of &#8776;6 &#215; 104).








Abstract
Nanoscale shape engineering is an essential requirement for the practical use of 2D&#160;materials, aiming at precisely customizing optimal structures and properties. In this work, sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;scale block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembled nanopatterns finely aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, are exploited for reliable nanopatterning of 2D materials. The underlying mechanism for the alignment of the self&#8208;assembled nanodomains is elucidated based on the wetting layer alternation of the BCP film in the presence of intermediate 2D flakes. The resultant highly aligned nanocylinder templates with remarkably low levels of line edge roughness (LER) and line&#8208;width roughness (LWR) yield a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm&#8208;wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR) array with noticeable switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio up to &#8776;6 &#215; 104).

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The importance of modulations has been elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, are utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges, but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which will stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations towards a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>

Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. The in&#8208;situ absorption spectrum study indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1 based 1 cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent PCE of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

However, the photovoltaic performance of large-area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx-1 and Qx-2, show quite different film-formation kinetics in the slot-die coating process.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e. gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which improves the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. We&#160;present the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors. We&#160;found that the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (which we&#160;term HACS) response was&#160;dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8211;ratio of diameters and helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, we&#160;could obtain sensors that responded to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values. We&#160;found a greater auxetic character resulted in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8211;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, we&#160;obtained the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far. We&#160;propose a mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;assembly of Silica Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since we still lack the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, we provide such means based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in&#8208;vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, we generated a library of stereoisomers, which allowed us to characterize different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, we were able to control the morphology of silica particles via manipulation of the template precursors.

         <title>Dynamic Sustainable Polyimide Film Combining Hardness with Softness via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;Like&#8221; Bionic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic polyimide (PI) film, which can transform among three molecular structures,&#160;is designed by imitating the behavior of the Mimosa plant. The PI film is a super&#8208;corona&#8208;resistant film, a matrix of high&#8208;sensitivity humidity sensor and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites due to its excellent capabilities of degradation, self&#8208;healable ability, and recyclability.








Abstract
Dielectric polyimides (PIs)&#160;are ubiquitous as insulation in electrical power systems and electronic devices. Generally, dynamic polyimide is required to solve irreversible failure processes of electrical or mechanical damage, for example, under high temperature, pressure, and field strength. The challenge lies in the design of the molecular structure of rigid polyimide to achieve dynamic reversibility. Herein, a low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polyimide gene unit is designed to crosslink with polyimide ligase to prepare the smart film. Interestingly, due to the variability of gene unit and ligase combinations, the polyimide films combining hardness with softness are designed into three forms via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;like&#8221; bionic strategy to adapt to different application scenarios. Meanwhile, the films have good degradation efficiency, excellent recyclability, and can be self&#8208;healable, which makes them reuse. Clearly, the films can be used in the preparation of ultrafast sensors with a response time &#8776;0.15 s and the application of corona&#8208;resistant films with 100% recovery. Furthermore, the construction of polyimide and carbon&#8208;fiber&#8208;reinforced composites (CFRCs) has been verified to apply to the worse environment. Nicely, the composites have the property of multiple cycles and the non&#8208;destructive recycle rate of carbon fiber (CF) is as high as 100%. The design idea of preparing high&#8208;strength dynamic polyimide by crosslinking simple polyimide gene unit with ligase could provide a good foundation and a clear case for the sustainable development of electrical and electronic polyimides, from the perspective of Mimosa bionics.

         <title>Fluorination Enhances NIR&#8208;II Emission and Photothermal Conversion Efficiency of Phototheranostic Agents for Imaging&#8208;Guided Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorination of A&#8211;D&#8211;A type planar phototheranostic agents can simultaneously enhance NIR&#8208;II quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Accordingly, the structure of vasculature and NIR&#8208;IIimaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy of tumor are successfully achieved owing to the high NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%) of fluorinated phototheranostic agents. This work provides an intriguing guideline for designing highly efficient NIR&#8208;II phototheranostic agents.








Abstract
Phototheranostics with second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging and photothermal effect have become a burgeoning biotechnology for tumor diagnosis and precise treatment. As important parameters of phototheranostic agents (PTAs), fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) are usually considered as a pair of contradictions that is difficult to be simultaneously enhanced. Herein, a fluorination strategy for designing A&#8211;D&#8211;A type PTAs with synchronously improved QY and PCE is proposed. Experimental results show that the molar extinction coefficient (&#949;), NIR&#8208;II QY, and PCE of all fluorinated PTAs nanoparticles (NPs) are definitely improved compared with the chlorinated counterparts. Theoretical calculation results demonstrate that fluorination can maximize the electrostatic potential difference by virtue of the high electronegativity of fluorine, which may increase intra/intermolecular D&#8211;A interactions, tighten molecule packing,&#160;and further promote the increase of &#949;, ultimately leading to simultaneously enhanced QY and PCE. In these PTA NPs, FY6&#8208;NPs display NIR&#8208;II emission extended to 1400&#160;nm with the highest NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%). These features make FY6&#8208;NPs perform well in high&#8208;resolution imaging of vasculature and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumors. This study develops a valuable guideline for constructing NIR&#8208;II organic PTAs with high performance.

         <title>Injectable Anti&#8208;Inflammatory Supramolecular Nanofiber Hydrogel to Promote Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy in Age&#8208;Related Macular Degeneration Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF), with CaCl2. Such a BetP hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents can prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy, and may be readily translated into clinical use for age&#8208;related macular degeneration treatment, with the potential to replace the current therapy.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) is a major cause of visual impairment and severe vision loss worldwide, while the currently available treatments are often unsatisfactory. Previous studies have demonstrated both inflammation and oxidative&#8208;stress&#8208;induced damage to the retinal pigment epithelium are involved in the pathogenesis of aberrant development of blood vessels in wet AMD (wet&#8208;AMD). Although antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy (e.g., Ranibizumab) can impair the growth of new blood vessels, side effects are still found with repeated monthly intravitreal injections. Here, an injectable antibody&#8208;loaded supramolecular nanofiber hydrogel is fabricated by simply mixing betamethasone phosphate (BetP), a clinic anti&#8208;inflammatory drug, anti&#8208;VEGF, the gold&#8208;standard anti&#8208;VEGF drug for AMD treatment, with CaCl2. Upon intravitreal injection, such BetP&#8208;based hydrogel (BetP&#8208;Gel),&#160;while enabling long&#8208;term sustained release of anti&#8208;VEGF to inhibit vascular proliferation in the retina and attenuate choroidal neovascularization, can also scavenge reactive oxygen species to reduce local inflammation. Remarkably, such BetP&#8208;Gel can dramatically prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti&#8208;VEGF therapy. Notably, anti&#8208;VEGF&#8208;loaded supramolecular hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents may be readily translated into clinical use for AMD treatment, with the potential to replace the current anti&#8208;VEGF therapy.

Upon intravitreal injection, such BetP-based hydrogel (BetP-Gel),&#160;while enabling long-term sustained release of anti-VEGF to inhibit vascular proliferation in the retina and attenuate choroidal neovascularization, can also scavenge reactive oxygen species to reduce local inflammation. Remarkably, such BetP-Gel can dramatically prolong the effective treatment time of conventional anti-VEGF therapy. Notably, anti-VEGF-loaded supramolecular hydrogel based on all clinically approved agents may be readily translated into clinical use for AMD treatment, with the potential to replace the current anti-VEGF therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phosphorous Dendron Micelles as a Nanomedicine Platform for Cooperative Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doxorubicin&#8208;loaded nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendron micelles with intrinsic immunomodulatory activity is constructed. The created nanomedicine can synergistically proliferate natural killer (NK) cells, recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease regulatory T cells, thus allowing for chemoimmunotherapy of tumors with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis.








Abstract
Design of effective nanomedicines to modulate multiple immune cells to overcome the immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment is desirable to improve the overall poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy. Herein, a nanomedicine platform is reported based on chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded phosphorus dendron micelles (M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX, TBP, tyramine bearing two dimethylphosphonate) with inherent immunomodulatory activity for synergistic tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX micelles with good stability and a mean particle size of 86.4 nm can deliver DOX to solid tumors to induce significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). With the demonstrated intrinsic activity of M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa that can promote the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, the ICD&#8208;resulted maturation of dendritic cells of the DOX&#8208;loaded micelles, and the combination of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, the synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation, recruitment of tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease of regulatory T cells for effective tumor chemoimmunotherapy with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis are demonstrated. The developed phosphorous dendron micelles may hold great promise to be used as an advanced nanomedicine formulation for synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation for effective chemoimmunotherapy of different tumor types.

         <title>Tailored Polypeptide Star Copolymers for 3D Printing of Bacterial Composites Via Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printing of biocompatible hydrogel networks based on the self&#8208;assembly of 3&#8208;arm polypeptide stars permits the additive manufacturing of &#8220;living&#8221; objects. In this work, the design of the 3&#8208;arm block copolypeptide stars allows for tuning of mechanical properties and printing performance while also directly impacting the proliferation, activity, and colony formation of embedded Escherichia coli.








Abstract
Hydrogels hold much promise for 3D printing of functional living materials; however, challenges remain in tailoring mechanical robustness as well as biological performance. In addressing this challenge, the modular synthesis of functional hydrogels from 3&#8208;arm diblock copolypeptide stars composed of an inner poly(l&#8208;glutamate) domain and outer poly(l&#8208;tyrosine) or poly(l&#8208;valine) blocks is described. Physical crosslinking due to &#223;&#8208;sheet assembly of these star block copolymers gives mechanical stability during extrusion printing and the selective incorporation of methacrylate units allows for subsequent photocrosslinking to occur under biocompatible conditions. This permits direct ink writing (DIW) printing of bacteria&#8208;based mixtures leading to 3D objects with high fidelity and excellent bacterial viability. The tunable stiffness of different copolypeptide networks enables control over proliferation and colony formation for embedded Escherichia coli bacteria as demonstrated via isopropyl &#223;&#8208;d&#8208;1&#8208;thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This translation of molecular structure to network properties highlights the versatility of these polypeptide hydrogel systems with the combination of writable structures and biological activity illustrating the future potential of these 3D&#8208;printed biocomposites.

         <title>Reducing Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells via Extending the Fused Ring Donor Unit of an A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;Type Nonfullerene Acceptor for Over 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extending the donor core in a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) is applied to suppress trap states in organic solar cells (OSCs). TTPIC&#8208;4F with an extended core exhibits higher crystallinity than BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSCs afford a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3 for higher mobility and reduced &#916;Enr, and achieve an impressive PCE of 17.1%, which is the record for A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type NFAs.








Abstract
The high trap density (generally 1016 to 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3) in thin films of organic semiconductors is the primary reason for the inferior charge&#8208;carrier mobility and large nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) in organic solar cells (OSCs), limiting improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, the trap density in OSCs is efficiently reduced via extending the donor core of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) from a heptacyclic unit to a nonacyclic unit. TTPIC&#8208;4F with a nonacyclic unit has stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, affording higher crystallinity in thin films relative to its counterpart BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based device achieves a lower trap density of 4.02&#160;&#215;&#160;1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, comparable to some typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, with higher mobility and inhibited charge&#8208;carrier recombination in devices. Therefore, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe in regenerated LiFePO4 (RSLFP@NC), which effectively restrains Fe migration and the formation of antisite defects during cycling. Therefore, the regenerated LFP shows excellent cycling performance with &#8776;80% retention after 1000&#160;cycles, which is better than the cycling performance of pristine LiFePO4.








Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) has been produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of the economic and environmental benefits; the direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by direct recycling is not ideal due to the migration of Fe ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish Li+ diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. In this work, spent LFP is regenerated by using environmentally friendly ethanol, and its cycling stability is promoted by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via construction of a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#63743;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The Li+ diffusion kinetics in the regenerated LFP are improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, &#160;the regenerated LFP exhibits an ultrastable cycling performance at a high rate of 10&#160;C with &#8776;80% capacity retention after 1000&#160;cycles.

         <dc:description>
A novel Janus Au&#8211;porphyrin polymersome heterostructure (J&#8208;AuPPS) is constructed by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis process. The near&#8208;field enhancement effect between the porphyrin polymersome and Au nanoparticles in the as&#8208;prepared J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to synergistically improve the photochemical activity. As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS shows enhanced in vitro&#160;and in vivo phototherapy effects in bacterial ablation and combating implant&#8208;associated infections.








Abstract
Polymer&#8211;inorganic hybrid Janus nanoparticles (PI&#8208;JNPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their special structures and functions. However, achieving the synergistic enhancement of photochemical activity between polymer and inorganic moieties in PI&#8208;JNPs remains challenging. Herein, the construction of a novel Janus Au&#8211;porphyrin polymersome (J&#8208;AuPPS) heterostructure by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis is reported. The near&#8208;field enhancement (NFE) effect between porphyrin polymersome (PPS) and Au nanoparticles in J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to enhance its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption and electric/thermal field intensity at their interface, which improves the energy transfer and energetic charge&#8208;carrier generation. Therefore, J&#8208;AuPPS shows a higher NIR&#8208;activated photothermal conversion efficiency (48.4%) and generates more singlet oxygen compared with non&#8208;Janus core&#8211;particle Au&#8211;PPS nanostructure (28.4%). As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS exhibits excellent dual&#8208;mode (photothermal/photodynamic) antibacterial and anti&#8208;biofilm performance, thereby significantly enhancing&#160;the in vivo therapeutic effect in an implant&#8208;associated&#8208;infection rat model. This work is believed to motivate the rational design of advanced hybrid JNPs with desirable NFE effect and further extend their biological applications.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. Herein, we report a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles (branched NPs) could more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieved an enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effect. Our work presents a promising approach for targeting the metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>Gold Nanobipyramid&#8208;Mediated Apoptotic Camouflage of Adipocytes for Obesity Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Obesity treatment is a global public health challenge due to the inadequate weight loss and weight regain even after endeavors with multimodal treatments. Considering abundant resident macrophages in adipose tissues, precise regulation of the interactions between macrophages and adipocytes may provide chances for immunotherapy of obesity. Herein, inspired by the phagocytosis of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells in homeostasis, an immunotherapy strategy for obesity treatment was proposed for the first time through apoptotic camouflage of adipocytes by PAAu BPs to activate macrophages for clearance, where PAAu BPs were gold nanobipyramids engineered with adipose&#8208;targeting and apoptotic cell&#8208;mimicking functions. During the clearance, macrophage was switched from pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 to anti&#8208;inflammatory M2, remarkably modulating the immune microenvironment of adipose tissues to prevent weight regain. After inguinal injection with PAAu BPs, the body weights of obesity mice were effectively decreased by 24.4%, and could be decreased by 33.3% when combined with photothermal lipolysis, and little weight regain was associated with treatments. This study demonstrates the strategy of camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic feature holds great potential for obesity immunotherapy.

         <title>Assembly of Fillable Microrobotic Systems by Microfluidic Loading with Dip Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microrobots can provide spatiotemporally well&#8208;controlled cargo delivery that can improve therapeutic efficiency compared to conventional drug delivery strategies. Robust microfabrication methods to expand the variety of materials or cargoes that can be incorporated into microrobots could greatly broaden the scope of their functions. However, current surface coating or direct blending techniques used for cargo loading result in inefficient loading and poor cargo protection during transportation, which leads to cargo waste, degradation, and non&#8208;specific release. Herein, we present a versatile platform to fabricate fillable microrobots using Microfluidic Loading and Dip Sealing (MLDS). MLDS enables the encapsulation of different types of cargoes within hollow microrobots and protection of cargo integrity. The technique is supported by high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with an integrated microfluidic loading system, which realises a highly precise loading process and improves cargo loading capacity. A corresponding dip sealing strategy was developed to encase and protect the loaded cargo whilst maintaining the geometric and structural integrity of the loaded microrobots. This dip sealing technique is suitable for different materials, including thermal and light responsive materials. The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 monitoring at room temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand of self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8208;i&#8208;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device was designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor was integrated onto a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. Our results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Reversible Discharge Products in Li&#8722;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8722;air (Li&#8722;air) batteries stand out among the post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density, which has rapidly progressed in the past years. Regarding the fundamental mechanism of Li&#8208;air batteries that discharge products produced and decomposed during charging and recharging progress, the reversibility of products closely affects the battery performance. Along with the upsurge of the mainstream discharge products lithium peroxide, with devoted efforts to screening electrolytes, constructing high&#8208;efficiency cathodes, and optimizing anodes, much progress has been made in the fundamental understanding and performance. However, the limited advancement is insufficient. In this case, the investigations of other discharge products, including lithium hydroxide, lithium superoxide, lithium oxide, and lithium carbonate, emerge and bring breakthroughs for the Li&#8722;air battery technologies. To deepen the understanding of the electrochemical reactions and conversions of discharge products in the battery, we systematically review recent advances in the various discharge products, mainly focusing on the growth and decomposition mechanisms and the determining factors. We also provide perspectives for Li&#8722;air batteries on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium&#8722;air (Li&#8722;air) batteries stand out among the post-Li-ion batteries due to their high energy density, which has rapidly progressed in the past years. Regarding the fundamental mechanism of Li-air batteries that discharge products produced and decomposed during charging and recharging progress, the reversibility of products closely affects the battery performance. Along with the upsurge of the mainstream discharge products lithium peroxide, with devoted efforts to screening electrolytes, constructing high-efficiency cathodes, and optimizing anodes, much progress has been made in the fundamental understanding and performance. However, the limited advancement is insufficient. In this case, the investigations of other discharge products, including lithium hydroxide, lithium superoxide, lithium oxide, and lithium carbonate, emerge and bring breakthroughs for the Li&#8722;air battery technologies. To deepen the understanding of the electrochemical reactions and conversions of discharge products in the battery, we systematically review recent advances in the various discharge products, mainly focusing on the growth and decomposition mechanisms and the determining factors. We also provide perspectives for Li&#8722;air batteries on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Universal Perovskite Nanocrystal Ink for High&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Semiconducting lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices due to their solution processability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. While the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaics (PVs), two prime examples of optoelectronic devices, has recently seen a multitude of efforts towards high&#8208;performance PNC&#8208;based devices, realizing both devices with high efficiencies and stabilities through a single PNC processing strategy has remained a challenge. Herein we demonstrate that diphenylproplyammonium (DPAI) surface ligands, found through a judicious ab initio based ligand search, provide a solution to this problem. Our universal PNC ink with DPAI ligands, prepared through a solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange process, simultaneously allows single&#8208;step processed LED and PV devices with peak electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 17.00% and power conversion efficiency of 14.92% (stabilized output 14.00%), respectively. We reveal that a careful design of the aromatic rings such as in DPAI is the decisive factor in bestowing such high performances, ease of solution processing, and improved phase stability up to 120 days. Our work illustrates the power of ligand design in producing nanocrystal ink formulations for high&#8208;throughput production of optoelectronic devices; it also paves a path for &#8220;dual&#8208;mode&#8221; devices with both PV and LED functionalities.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8208;ZnO Solid Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8208;ZnO homogeneous solid solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8208;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39&#8806;x&#8806;0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density function theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid solution films.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multi&#8208;Functional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires identifying the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs were mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for identifying the similarity function. Sneak current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying&#8208;memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors' inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Bi&#8208;directional water&#8208;stream behavior on multifunctional membrane for simultaneous energy generation and water purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydro&#8208;electric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources (e.g., sea water, ground water, sweat, or rain) and polluted water. However, as the conventional hydro&#8208;electric nanogenerator only utilizes water resources, it cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, we propose a water purification membrane that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (Electricity generation and purification membrane, EPM) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, EPM exhibited high energy generation performances (maximum power 16.44 &#956;W and energy 15.16 mJ) by the streaming effect of water&#8208;streaming carbon nanotubes (CNT) and ion&#8208;permselective effect of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Moreover, by using poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, we substantially improved the energy generation performance and long&#8208;term stability and provided outstanding mechanical stability, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, EPM exhibited the water purification characteristics of &gt;90% rejection of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of angstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposed an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next&#8208;generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.

Abstract
Mesocrystals are a class of nanostructured material, where a multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. Resolving the mesocrystal structure is quite challenging due to their structuration on different length scales. The combination of small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) techniques offers the possibility of non&#8208;destructively probing mesocrystalline structures simultaneously, over multiple length scales to reveal their microscopic structure. This work describes how high dynamical range of modern detectors sheds light on the weak features of scattering, significantly increasing the information content. The detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) from the magnetite mesocrystals with different particle sizes and shapes is described, in tandem with electron microscopy. The revealed features provide valuable input to the models of mesocrystal growth and the choice of structural motif; the impact on magnetic properties is discussed.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Photosensitizer&#8208;Loaded Nano&#8208;Superartificial Dendritic Cells with Directly Presenting Tumor Antigens and Reversed Immunosuppression for Photodynamically Boosted Immunotherapy</title>

Nano&#8208;superartificial dendritic cells (saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs) are developed by coating superartificial dendritic cells membranes onto aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers. The outer cell membranes are derived from engineered 4T1 cells in which pMHC&#8208;I, CD86, and anti&#8208;LAG3 are simultaneously anchored. saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs directly stimulate T&#8208;cell activation and reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy. The inner AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death to improve tumor microenvironment, which boosts immunotherapy efficiency.








Abstract
The success of tumor immunotherapy highlights the potential of harnessing immune system to fight cancer. Activating both native T cells and exhausted T cells is a critical step for generating effective antitumor immunity, which is determined based on the efficient presentation of tumor antigens and co&#8208;stimulatory signals by antigen&#8208;presenting cells, as well as immunosuppressive reversal. However, strategies for achieving an efficient antigen presentation process and improving the&#160;immunosuppressive microenvironment remain unresolved. Here, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) photosensitizer&#8208;loaded nano&#8208;superartificial dendritic cells (saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs) are developed by coating superartificial dendritic cells membranes from genetically engineered 4T1 tumor cells onto nanoaggregates of AIE photosensitizers. The outer cell membranes of saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs are derived from recombinant lentivirus&#8208;infected 4T1 tumor cells in which peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex class I, CD86, and anti&#8208;LAG3 antibody are simultaneously anchored. These saDC@Fs&#8208;NPs could directly stimulate T&#8208;cell activation and reverse T&#8208;cell exhaustion for cancer immunotherapy. The inner AIE&#8208;active photosensitizers induce immunogenic cell death to activate dendritic cells and enhance T lymphocyte infiltration by photodynamic therapy, promoting the transformation of &#8220;cold tumors&#8221; into &#8220;hot tumors,&#8221; which further boosts&#160;immunotherapy efficiency. This work presents a powerful photoactive and artificial antigen&#8208;presenting platform for activating both native T cells and exhausted T cells, as well as facilitating tumor photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Suppressing the dynamic oxygen evolution of sodium layered cathodes through synergistic surface dielectric polarization and bulk site&#8208;Selective Co&#8208;doping</title>

Abstract
Utilizing anionic redox activity within layered oxide cathode materials represents a transformational avenue for enabling high&#8208;energy&#8208;density rechargeable batteries. However, the anionic oxygen redox reaction is often accompanied with irreversible dynamic oxygen evolution, leading to unfavorable structural distortion and thus severe voltage decay and rapid capacity fading. Herein, we propose and validate that the dynamic oxygen evolution can be effectively suppressed through the synergistic surface CaTiO3 dielectric coating and bulk site&#8208;selective Ca/Ti co&#8208;doping for layered Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2. The surface dielectric coating layer not only suppresses the surface oxygen release but more importantly inhibits the bulk oxygen migration by creating a reverse electric field through dielectric polarization. Meanwhile, the site&#8208;selective doping of oxygen&#8208;affinity Ca into Na layers and Ti into transition metal layers effectively stabilizes the bulk oxygen through modulating the O 2p band center and the oxygen migration barrier. Such a strategy also leads to a reversible structural evolution with a low volume change because of the enhanced structural integrality and improved oxygen rigidity. Because of these synergistic advantages, the designed electrode exhibits greatly suppressed voltage decay and capacity fading upon long&#8208;term cycling. Our study affords a promising strategy for regulating the dynamic oxygen evolution to achieve high&#8208;capacity layered cathode materials.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, most MOFs are difficult to grow spontaneously or be processed into films. Here, we demonstrate a convenient strategy for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>A Multifunctional &#8220;halide&#8208;Equivalent&#8221; Anion Enabling Efficient CsPb(Br/I)3 Nanocrystals Pure&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 23%</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are promising candidates for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the pure&#8208;red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) available today made from mixed&#8208;halide CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs suffer from a compromise in their emission efficiency and spectral stability on account of severe trap&#8208;mediated nonradiative recombination loss, halide phase segregation, and self&#8208;doping effect, all of which are caused by the surface halide vacancies. Herein, we introduced a &#8220;halide&#8208;equivalent&#8221; anion of benzenesulfonate (BS&#8722;) into CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs as multifunctional additive to simultaneously address the above challenging issues. Joint experiment&#8208;theory characterizations reveal that the BS&#8722; can not only passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ related defects at surface of NCs, but also increase the formation energy of halide vacancies, resulting in substantially improved optical properties and phase stability of NCs. Moreover, electrons are expected to transfer from the CsPb(Br/I)3 NC to BS&#8722; because of the strong electron&#8208;withdrawing property of sulfonate group, which reduces the self&#8208;doping effect and alters the n&#8208;type behavior of CsPb(Br/I)3 NCs to near ambipolarity for balancing carrier injection in the device. Eventually, synergistic boost in device performance is achieved for pure&#8208;red PeLEDs with Commission Internationale del'Eclairage color coordinates of (0.70, 0.30) and a champion external quantum efficiency of 23.5%, which is a record value among the ever&#8208;reported red PeLEDs approaching to the Rec. 2020 red primary color. Moreover, the BS&#8722;&#8208;modified PeLEDs demonstrates robust spectral stability, showing negligible wavelength shift under different operating voltages. This strategy paves an efficient way for improving the efficiency and stability of pure&#8208;red PeLEDs.

         <title>Simple Visualization of Universal Ferroelastic Domain Walls in Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Domain features and domain walls in lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have attracted broad interest due to their potential impact on optoelectronic properties of this unique class of solution&#8208;processable semiconductors. Using non&#8208;polarized light and simple imaging configurations, we directly visualize ferroelastic twin domains and their switchings through multiple consecutive phase transitions. This direct optical contrast originates from finite optical reflections at the wall interface between two compositionally identical, orientationally different, optically anisotropic domains inside the material bulk. Our findings show these domain walls serve as internal reflectors and steer energy transport inside halide perovskites optically. First&#8208;principles calculations show universal low domain&#8208;wall energies and modest energy barriers of domain switching, confirming their prevalent appearance, stable presence, and facile moving observed in the experiments. The generality of ferroelasticity in halide perovskites stems from their soft bonding characteristics. This work shows the feasibility of using LHP twin domain walls as optical guides of internal photoexcitations, capable of non&#8208;volatile on&#8208;off switching and tunable positioning endowed by their universal ferroelasticity.

         <title>Reshaping de Novo Protein Switches into Bioresponsive Materials for Biomarker, Toxin, and Viral Detection</title>

Abstract
De novo designed protein switches are powerful tools to specifically and sensitively detect diverse targets with simple chemiluminescent readouts.[6] Finding an appropriate material host for de novo design protein switches without altering their thermodynamics while preserving their intrinsic stability over time would enable the development of a variety of sensing formats to monitor exposure to pathogens, toxins, and for disease diagnosis. Here we generate a de novo protein&#8208;biopolymer hybrid that maintains the detection capabilities induced by the conformational change of the incorporated proteins in response to analytes of interest in multiple, shelf&#8208;stable material formats without the need of refrigerated storage conditions. A set of functional demonstrator devices including personal protective equipment such as masks and laboratory gloves, free&#8208;standing films, air quality monitors, and wearable devices is presented to illustrate the versatility of the approach. Such formats are designed to be responsive to human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2), anti&#8208;hepatitis B (HBV) antibodies, Botulinum neurotoxin B (BoNT/B), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). This combination of form and function offers wide opportunities for ubiquitous sensing in multiple environments by enabling a large class of bio&#8208;responsive interfaces of broad utility.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;Thick 2D Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to print arrays of atomic&#8208;thick semiconducting thin films is demonstrated, which enables printed devices with micrometer&#8208;scale resolution, high density, and attractive performance, thus paving the way for practical large&#8208;area application of 2D crystals in electronic devices at an affordable cost.








Abstract
2D semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum&#8208;metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy is demonstrated utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 at 25&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, 2D transistors are printed with a density of &#8776;47&#160;000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provides a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Partially Solvating Diluent for Lithium/Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte employing partially solvating monofluorobenzene as the diluent is developed for Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Benefiting from the stable interphases simultaneously formed on both the anode and cathode, dendrite&#8208;free cycling of lithium&#8208;metal anodes with high Coulombic efficiency and highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells with low lithium&#8208;metal excess have been achieved.








Abstract
The development of Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries requires electrolytes that can form stable electrolyte/electrode interphases simultaneously on lithium&#8208;metal anodes (LMAs) and SPAN cathodes. Herein, a low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (LCILE) employing monofluorobenzene (mFBn) as the diluent is proposed for Li/SPAN cells. Unlike non&#8208;solvating diluents in other LCILEs, mFBn partially solvates Li+, decreasing the coordination between Li+ and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;). In turn, this triggers a more substantial decomposition of FSI&#8722; and consequently results in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in inorganic compounds, which enables a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (99.72%) of LMAs. Meanwhile, a protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), derived mainly from FSI&#8722; and organic cations, is generated on the SPAN cathodes, preventing the dissolution of polysulfides. Benefiting from the robust interphases simultaneously formed on both the electrodes, a highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells for 250 cycles with a capacity retention of 71% is achieved employing the LCILE and only 80% lithium&#8208;metal excess.

         <title>Anharmonic Cation&#8211;Anion Coupling Dynamics Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Sulfide Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By comparing the anharmonic phonon coupling calculations with the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, this study unveils a unique phenomenon in sulfide solid electrolytes in comparison with halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors often show higher Li&#8208;ion conductivity than other types of electrolyte materials. This work unveils a unique Li&#8208;ion conductive behavior in these materials through the perspective of anharmonic coupling assisted Li&#8208;ion diffusion. Li hopping events can happen simultaneously with various types of lattice dynamics, while only a statistically important synchronization of motions may indicate coupling. This method enables a direct evaluation of the coupling strength between these motions, which more fundamentally decides if a specific type of lattice motion is really anharmonically coupled to the Li hopping event and whether the coupling can facilitate the Li diffusion. By a new ab initio computational approach, this work unveils a unique phenomenon in prototype sulfide electrolytes in comparison with typical halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing phonon modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes. The coupling pushes Li ions toward the diffusion channels for reduced diffusion barriers. The result from the lower temperature range (&#8776;0&#8211;300 K) of simulation can also be more relevant to the application of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphocholine&#8208;based Janus dendrimer is reported, which lacks the &#8220;weak points&#8221; that result in the chemical and physical instability of natural liposomes. Despite their synthetic nature, the resulting self&#8208;assembled dendrimersomes recapitulate the most important physical properties of cell membranes. This enables functionalization with natural functional molecules as well as mimicry of cellular functions on a basic level.








Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron is introduced. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

Herein, a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JD&lt;sup&gt;PC&lt;/sup&gt;) and a 3,5-substituted dihydrobenzoate-based hydrophobic dendron is introduced. JD&lt;sup&gt;PC&lt;/sup&gt; self-assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z-DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore-forming peptides, structure-directing lipids, and glycans to create raft-like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z-DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life-like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z-DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life-like features and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Information&#8208;Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information&#8208;storage expansion, and dual&#8208;encryption are realized.








Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information&#8208;storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Design of Smart Aggregates: Toward Rapid Clinical Diagnosis of Hyperlipidemia in Human Blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. They can act as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221; and autonomously respond to HLP to realize in vitro detection and in vivo imaging in mice and human blood. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm).








Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive properties are desired for their wide practical applications such as bioprobes. Here, a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit a twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect in aqueous media, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in highly viscous media due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. These aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures are described, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Bithiophene&#8208;Imide&#8208;Based Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM)&#160;PFBTI is successfully developed for PVSCs. The suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent surface passivation effects endow PFBTI&#8208;based organic/inorganic hybrid PVSCs with a promising PCE of 23.1% and much&#8208;enhanced stability. PFBTI can be further used in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and achieve high PCEs.








Abstract
The development of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability, and comprehensive passivation is significant for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety effectively enhances hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as the HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Photoswitchable Microgels for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light is demonstrated. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light stimulates in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that increases RGD availability, thereby facilitating macrophage adhesion linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization. Visible light induces the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that decreases RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled structures is achieved irreversibly or under non&#8208;physiological conditions, thereby limiting their biomedical, environmental, and catalysis applicability. In this study, microgels composed of azobenzene derivatives stacked via &#960;&#8211;cation and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are developed that are electrostatically stabilized with Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD)&#8208;bearing anionic polymers. Lateral swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels occurs via cis&#8208;azobenzene formation mediated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light, which disrupts intermolecular interactions on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;coated materials. Real&#8208;time imaging and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;azobenzene formation. Near&#8208;infrared light can induce in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to increase RGD availability and trigger release of loaded interleukin&#8208;4, which facilitates the adhesion structure assembly linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages. In contrast, visible light can induce deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to decrease RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization. These microgels exhibit high stability and non&#8208;toxicity. Versatile use of ligands and protein delivery can offer cytocompatible and photoswitchable manipulability of diverse host cells.

         <title>Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributor to self&#8208;regulate/orientate the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level. Remarkably, Na symmetric cells achieve unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities in additive&#8208;free carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large&#8208;scale practical implementation of Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well&#8208;ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributors to self&#8208;orientate/homogenize the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805;1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#8805;700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive&#8208;free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8211;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low&#8208;cost, and safe&#8208;credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic topological materials rely on strong interaction between localized spins and states comprising the topological bands. This interaction is directly interrogated in an intrinsic magnetic topological material, MnBi2Te4, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. It is found that this exchange coupling is &gt;100 times stronger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of &gt;25 meV.








Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, a topological insulator with intrinsic antiferromagnetism. This is achieved by optically exciting Bi&#8208;Te p states comprising the bulk topological bands and interrogating the consequent Mn 3d spin dynamics, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. Ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that the p states demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation, the Mn 3d spins, probed by resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are observed to disorder concurrently with the p spins. Together with atomistic simulations, this reveals that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the surface states. By quantifying this exchange coupling, this study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to manipulate topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Zn&#8211;Air Batteries&#160;with Long Lifetime Enabled by Reconstructed Amorphous Multi&#8208;Metallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air battery&#160;works well at high current densities of 100&#8211;400&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low voltages due to the OER intermediate O* migration from the Ni to the Fe site in a defect&#8208;rich ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide derived by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, helping to break the restriction of the scaling relationship and then resulting in high intrinsic OER activity with a theoretical overpotential of 170&#8201;mV.








Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries is crucial for widening their application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100, and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, is developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8&#160;mAh (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8211;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8722;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi&#8208;active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of the pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule&#8208;based engines with a quantum advantage are implemented using spin electronics to harvest the most basic form of energy: ambient heat. This ground&#8208;breaking interdisciplinary approach enables electrical output above room temperature using nanoscale electrical devices. This opens quantum technologies and spintronics toward disruptive energy applications, as a possible technological game&#8208;changer to help mitigate the energy/climate crises.








Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous is proposed. The spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co center of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin&#8208;selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface are measured. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built-in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic-based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide/Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene oxide/porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO/PG/GO) membrane separation technology by pressure&#8208;driven filtration is reported and it is applied in isotope separation at room temperature. It shows&#160;an excellent structural, long&#8208;term stability, ultralow energy consumption, and ultrahigh selectivity for deuterium water, including rejection rate of &#8776;97%, the selectivity of &#8776;35.2 as well.








Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is a strategic material that is widely used in and scientific research and has applications in fields such as nuclear energy generation. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room&#8208;temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores are sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25&#160;&#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O is &#8776;97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O is &#8776;35.2, and the excellent performance can be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water is successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage, and the membrane exhibits excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method does not require ultralow temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Textured perovskite films are formed artificially by controlling the dwell time of the antisolvent. Due to scattering at the textured surface, photons trapped in the waveguide mode can be extracted. Therefore, the external quantum efficiency is boosted significantly from 10% for flat perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to 20.5% for textured PeLEDs with an extraordinarily thick perovskite layer of 1.5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs is reported. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film&#8208;forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nm, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 &#181;m. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 &#181;m. This study provides a novel way of forming light&#8208;extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;Doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high sonodynamic therapy efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.








Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, resulting in redshifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, it is found that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs (nanoparticles of BAnTh&#160;and BTeTh) shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell Toward Superior Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ is modified by 2&#8208;propanol to form a eutectic solvation shell, which can promote the oriented deposition of Zn metal and great desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. Attributed to its new outer solvation structure design, fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling capability of Zn&#8208;ion batteries under extreme temperature operation condition are achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among a next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, it is demonstrated that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500&#160;h under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance is achieved in a 150&#160;mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

         <title>Spontaneous Interface Healing by a Dynamic Liquid&#8208;Crystal Transition for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) molecules interacting with PbI2 retard the crystallization of the perovskite film, and finally increase the grain size. During annealing, the LC molecules undergo a phase transition, and then the flowable LC is extracted by the lower interface to release the residual stress, and accelerate electron extraction. A new engineering of additive phase transition is thus conceived.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature solution processing of thin&#8208;film semiconductors is more cost&#8208;effective than traditional vacuum processing; however, it leads to more defects during fast bulk crystallization and residual tensile stress. Herein, a new strategy of dynamic liquid&#8208;crystal transition (DLCT) is developed to solve these problems in one step. The design principle is used to suggest that the DLCT molecule should firstly interact with the perovskite grains in the bulk and meanwhile go through a dynamic transition to spontaneously heal the interface. A thermotropic LC molecule (CBO6SS6OCB) is then designed to demonstrate the strategy. The LC interacting with perovskite colloid forms an intermediate adduct to retard the crystallization. The annealing processes stimulate the concentrated LC solid, causing it to flow to the electron transport layer to release the residual stress to attain improved electron extraction. Consequently, the device efficiency is increased to 24.38%, where its VOC of 1.184&#160;V is among the best for the formamidine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the ambient stability (93.0% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of aging) and light stability (96.3% of initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of aging) are much improved. This work conceives a new engineering of additive phase transition for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on a Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrode with tailor&#8208;made hierarchical pores spanning from nanometer to millimeter scale is fabricated by in&#160;situ growth vertically aligned covalent organic framework nanoplatelets on graphene aerogel. This electrode exhibits an integration of high energy density and high power density as well as good cyclic stability in flexible supercapacitor devices.








Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#181;m is reported. Vertically aligned 2D covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm are in&#160;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5&#160;to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2&#160;to 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Simultaneously Stabilizing Both Electrodes and Electrolytes by a Self&#8208;Separating Organometallics Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries at Wide Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aid of electrochemical evolution of an organometallic compound, a self&#8208;separating interface layer for Zn anodes is designed, which can promote the electrode and electrolyte stability simultaneously. The interface with a polymeric C4N3 skeleton and cations homogenizes the Zn2+ flux, induces planar deposition, and maintain cathode stability, leading to high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long&#8208;term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self&#8208;separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon&#8208;enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc&#8208;ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface and sodium ions&#8217; equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000&#160;h and rate performance at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self&#8208;separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles from &#8722;35 to 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with an Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to construct superactive engines for self&#8208;propulsion of nanomotors under physiological concentration of H2O2. The PtPdMo ternary alloy induced by plasma improves the catalytic activity of the Pt&#8208;based engine, thus promoting movement both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously achieves nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy in traumatic&#8208;brain&#8208;injury mice.








Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing a feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. Herein, Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half&#8208;coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt&#8208;based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first&#8208;aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible gallium&#8208;based antifungal strategy (MLPGa), integrating lyticase and Ga ions, is&#160;developed for effective fungal keratitis treatment, which can degrade the permeation barrier of exopolysaccharides, then eradicate Candida albicans and biofilms through the mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharide degradation, intrinsic reactive oxygen production, and metabolic interference under Raman/PA bimodal imaging monitors.








Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in the fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) are presented that can degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both planktonic Candida albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron&#8208;ion&#8208;utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm&#8208;development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between the nanosystems and the gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed SnOCl ternary tin (II) alloy as hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells is reported, which results in efficiencies of 23.2% and 26.3% for Sn&#8211;Pb single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, respectively. Greatly enhanced light stabilities with T87 of &gt;1200 h and 85 &#176;C thermal stability with T85 of &gt;1500 h are achieved by using the SnOCl HTM.








Abstract
Tin&#8211;lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl is reported as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. The solution&#8208;processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that not only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#181;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1200&#160;h, and keeps 85% efficiency under 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 1500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improves the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multicomponent metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8211;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst (IrW&#8208;WO3/KIT&#8208;6) containing only 1&#160;wt% Ir is synthesized for efficient catalytic reduction of NO by CO to N2 under O2&#8208;containing conditions. This catalyst consists of ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6) supported with WO3 nanoparticles, and the latter is covered with atomic&#8208;dispersed IrW intermetallics.








Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here, a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1&#160;wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enables complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and has a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possesses a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Spectral Indicators of Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven classifier of band topology for a database of over 10&#160;000 compounds using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) features as input, achieving over 90% accuracy is developed. By leveraging the simplicity and versatility of XAS, this classifier has the potential to accelerate the discovery and screening of a much broader category of candidate topological materials.








Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials&#8217; topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms&#8217; local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10&#160;000 inorganic materials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively is leveraged. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase&#160;transitions.

A platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2) is developed. MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation, accompanied by rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, a platform for AD therapy is developed using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV&#8208;engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;Sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germanium oxide can function as a modifier of zeolite crystallization counter to its conventional role as a heteroatom. This effect is observed for two zeolite frameworks wherein GeO2&#160;addition promotes the formation of nano&#8208;sized crystals. Catalytic tests reveal significant enhancement in their performance, suggesting this method can be a commercially viable route to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites.








Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide (GeO2), to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultrasmall dimensions. This effect is observed for zeolites ZSM&#8208;11&#160;and ZSM&#8208;5 over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2&#160;in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2&#160;recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2&#160;compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid Electrolytes Induced by Growth of Internal Lithium Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphysics simulation presents electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte caused by internal electroplating of lithium (Li) through visualizing local stress, damage accumulation, and crack propagation. The results show that geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the solid electrolyte are critical factors dominating degradation of solid electrolytes, providing novel insights for design of future solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to mechanical degradation of the electrolyte and even short circuit of the cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercialization of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical phenomenon is hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields inside the solid electrolyte. Here, a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate evolution of the mechanical failure of the solid electrolyte induced by the internal growth of Li is reported. Visualization of local stress, damage, and crack propagation within the solid electrolyte enables examination of factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the&#160;electrolyte. Relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur in the region of the electrolyte/Li interface having great fluctuations. A high number density of Li filaments or voids triggers integration of damage and crack networks by enhanced propagation. This model is built on coupling of mechanical and electrochemical processes for internal plating of Li, revealing evolution of multiphysical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. Understanding mechanical degradation of solid electrolytes with the presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolytes for future solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cascade Responsive Nanoparticles Enhance Pancreatic Cancer Therapy by Eliminating Tumor&#8208;Resident Intracellular Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticles, consisting of a hyaluronic acid shell and a core assembled by an antibacterial polymer, are proposed. The nanoparticles sequentially trigger active tumor targeting, deep tumor penetration, efficient killing of intratumoral bacteria, and controlled drug release. The nanoparticles augment anticancer efficacy by eliminating tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria via non&#8208;antibiotic therapy.








Abstract
The limited drug penetration and robust bacteria&#8208;mediated drug inactivation in pancreatic cancer result in the failure of chemotherapy. To fight against these issues, a dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticle (sNP@G/IR) that can sequentially trigger deep penetration, killing of intratumor bacteria, and controlled release of chemo&#8208;drug, is reported. sNP@G/IR consists of a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;core (NP@G/IR), that encapsulates gemcitabine (Gem) and photothermal agent (IR1048). The polymer core, as an antibiotic alternative, is tailored to exert optimal antibacterial activity and selectivity. sNP@G/IR actively homes in on the tumor due to the CD44 targeting of the HA shell, which is subsequently degraded by the hyaluronidase in the extracellular matrix. The resultant NP@G/IR in decreased size and reversed charge facilitates deep tumor penetration. After cellular endocytosis, the exposed guanidine on NP@G/IR kills intracellular bacteria through disrupting cell membranes. Intracellular GSH further triggers the controlled release of the&#160;cargo. Thus, the protected Gem eventually induces cell apoptosis. Under laser irradiation, the hyperthermia of IR1048 helps further elimination of tumors and bacteria. Moreover, sNP@G/IR activates immune response, thereby reinforcing anticancer capacity. Therefore, this dual&#8208;cascade responsive sNP@G/IR eliminates tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria and augments drug delivery efficacy, providing a new avenue for improving cancer therapy.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.








Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through&#160;covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky&#8208;end&#8208;coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments&#160;using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18&#160;self&#8208;assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8211;9.32&#160;&#197; are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross&#8208;sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine&#8208;tuned for the self&#8208;assembly of designer nanocages, guest&#8211;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.

Tensegrity Architectures
In article number 2206876, Ruojie Sha and co&#8208;workers develop a structural library of augmented tensegrity architectures based on geometric expansion of triangular tiles. The highly asymmetric structure highlighted in the crystal lattice contains three linearly independent design axes that lay the foundation for the self&#8208;assembly of designer, heterogenous nanomaterials.

Organic Sonosensitizers
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented by Zhenqi Jiang, Frieder J&#228;kle, Xiaodong Yin, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2206594. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high SDT efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.

Microgels
In article number 2205498, Sehoon Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report the remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light. The microgels are electrostatically stabilized by cationic photoisomers and polyanions. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light using upconversion nanoparticles stimulates in situ swelling of the microgels and release of loaded cytokines, which facilitates pro&#8208;regenerative and anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of macrophages.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relation between morphology&#8211;structure and applications is intricate in covalent organic frameworks. This review highlights the progressive utilization of morphology&#8211;structure design toward the success of various applications. Furthermore, an outlook is put forward for improving the material performance by controlling the morphology&#8211;application design space.








Abstract
Translating the performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano&#8208; to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize, and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology versus application will help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. 2D and 3D frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, the carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. However, the research on COF chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications are provided. In each case, the underlying role of morphology is unveiled. Toward the end, a correlation between morphology and application is provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Catalytic Effects of Electrodes and Electrolytes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Progress and Prospective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with proper catalytic effects are promising in improving the performance of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. To promote the commercialization process of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in the future, the research progress of catalytic effects in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in recent years is reviewed, and the development direction of catalytic effects for next&#8208;generation metal&#8211;sulfur batteries is discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;sulfur (M&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices due to their advantages such as large energy density and the low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8211;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8211;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and, as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with desirable design can catalyze electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8211;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8211;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. The objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8211;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Challenges of Wafer&#8208;Scale Integration of 2D Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Transistor Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Static Random&#8208;Access Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) static random&#8208;access memory designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around structure to 2DMs further improves speed and area density, showing the feasible scaling path beyond the Si technology. The process challenges of 2DM nanosheet field&#8208;effect transistors are also discussed.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of 2D material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness reveals that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibits lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. This simulation predicts that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet (NS) gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduces cell read access time and write time and improves the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM NSFETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM NSFETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, are also discussed.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Pass&#8208;Transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is realized on a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 wafer. Such preliminary integration efforts exhibit a promising future for 2D semiconductors in integrated circuit application.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit&#8208;level optimization. Herein, a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film is successfully synthesized, which is then used to fabricate top&#8208;gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as static random access memory and ring oscillators are examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Precise Layer Control and Electronic State Modulation of a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Phase&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Growth</title>

Phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth is effective for synthesizing layer&#8208;controlled and electronic&#8208;state&#8208;modulated MoS2 films. The energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy is efficiently converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film on a wafer scale with excellent uniformity. The number of layers is precisely controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy (a&#8208;MoSxOy) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film. The number of MoS2 layers is readily controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a&#8208;MoSxOy, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb&#8208;inserted MoS2 with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS2 effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Logic and Ternary Content&#8208;Addressable Memory Based on Complementary Black Phosphorus and Rhenium Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;footprint nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide are demonstrated. A logic inverter with a high gain of over 270 and retention of 1000 s with a Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop feature is demonstrated by using only two transistors. Furthermore, a four&#8208;transistor nvTCAM cell with low processing temperature is realized with a high Rratio of &#8776;103.








Abstract
Hardware realization of in&#8208;memory computing for efficient data&#8208;intensive computation is regarded as a promising paradigm beyond the Moore era. However, to realize such functions, the device structure using traditional Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology is complex with a large footprint. 2D material&#8208;based heterostructures have a unique advantage to build versatile logic functions based on novel heterostructures with simplified device footprint and low power. Here, by adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism between a black phosphorus (BP) channel and a phosphorus oxide (POx) layer, a nonvolatile CMOS logic circuit based on 2D BP and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) with a high voltage gain of &#8776;275 is realized with a persistent hysteresis window. A Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop using only two transistors is also demonstrated, with far fewer transistor numbers than the conventional silicon counterpart, which usually requires six transistors. Furthermore, four&#8208;transistor (4T) nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (nvTCAM) cells are demonstrated with far fewer transistors for parallel data search. The nvTCAM cells exhibit high resistance ratios (Rratio) up to &#8776;103 between match and mismatch states with zero standby power thanks to the nonvolatility of the BP transistors. This back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible nvTCAM shows advantages over other structures with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <title>A Reconfigurable Two&#8208;WSe2&#8208;Transistor Synaptic Cell for Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) is a brain-inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision-making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward-modulation process in R-STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n-type and the other as p-type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&amp;gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti-)STDP component of 2T cell, R-STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low-power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area-efficient (100 &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Power&#8208;Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power&#8208;detector circuits are realized based on MoS2 channel transistors fabricated on flexible polyimide substrates. The work compares the DC and radio&#8208;frequency performance of multilayer and monolayer wafer&#8208;scale grown MoS2 for power detection and shows that both materials allow the fabrication of circuits that work at GHz frequencies with excellent dynamic range and responsivity.








Abstract
The design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated. The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick polyimide film, which, in principle, serves as a flexible substrate. The performances of two chemical vapor deposition MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power&#8208;detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in the Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best&#8208;performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB, outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures show a great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer RC. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect is realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work can provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;Timing&#8208;Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2&#8208;based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy&#160;and area efficient in&#8208;sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here a medium&#8208;scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21&#160;memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D&#160;monolayer MoS2&#160;for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1&#160;&#181;J by the 2D&#8208;memtransistor&#8208;based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in&#8208;sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

Logic Circuits
Are 2D semiconductors ready for next&#8208;generation IC application? In article number 2202472, Yufeng Xie, Lifeng Bian, Wenzhong Bao, and co&#8208;workers present a wafer&#8208;scale demonstration by circuit&#8208;level fabrication on a 4&#8208;inch MoS2 wafer. While pass&#8208;transistor configuration is more like an expedient to build logic circuits based on n&#8208;type MoS2, future development should add complementary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors to realize more complex ICs.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Microwave Circuits: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene&#8208;based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high&#8208;frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high&#8208;frequency applications.

         <title>Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (FETs) are affected by time&#8208;dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial&#8208;scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.








Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.

         <dc:description>
The developments of circuit&#8208;level memory technologies and in&#8208;memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large&#8208;scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large&#8208;scale 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory, static random&#8208;access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, mostly on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Progress and Challenges for Memtransistors in Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title>

Recent progress and ongoing challenges for memtransistors are reviewed in the context of neuromorphic computing in solid&#8208;state circuits and systems. Gate&#8208;tunable learning and bio&#8208;realistic functions in multi&#8208;terminal synaptic devices are compared for memtransistors and related floating gate and ferroelectric memories, suggesting opportunities for new architectures that are suitable as hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence algorithms.








Abstract
Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing of the brain. While non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switches, phase&#8208;change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions has shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi&#8208;terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio&#8208;realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. Herein, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices including dual&#8208;gated floating&#8208;gate memories, dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual&#8208;gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase&#8208;changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer&#8208;scale integration of memtransistors and multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Compact Modeling Technology for the Simulation of Integrated Circuits Based on Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
The progress made toward the development of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors under DC, transient, AC, and noise analysis, is reported. This includes non&#8208;idealities such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, traps&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi&#8208;static&#8208;effects.

Abstract
The progress made toward the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits is reported. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Another set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which can have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology toward higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers, is provided.
