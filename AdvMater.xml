         <title>Amorphous/Crystalline Heterojunction Engineered High&#8208;Density Strain in RuSeTe for Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering amorphous/crystalline heterojunctions in RuSeTe electrocatalysts introduce high&#8208;density tensile strain, enableing an ultralow overpotential of 20 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability for over 1100 hours at 100 mA cm&#8722;2&#8722;1 for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.








ABSTRACT
The efficiency and durability of electrocatalysts for&#160;the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are impeded by high overpotentials and sluggish kinetics, limiting their practical application. Here, we present a novel class of RuSeTe&#8208;based electrocatalysts featuring high&#8208;density tensile strain induced by amorphous/crystalline heterojunctions, where the strain distribution density is precisely regulated via interface length manipulation. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the tensile strain optimizes the d&#8208;band center and water adsorption energy, significantly reducing the energy barrier of the Volmer step. The optimized RuSeTe catalyst achieves an ultralow overpotential of 20 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 33 mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline media, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8208;based chalcogenides. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits sustained durability for 1100 h (&gt;45 days) at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2, maintaining a nearly constant potential throughout the test. This work proposes a universal strategy for inducing high&#8208;density strain through amorphous/crystalline heterointerface engineering, offering new insights into designing efficient and stable HER catalysts.

         <title>Printable Deep&#8208;Blue Fluorescent Light&#8208;Emitting &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Polymers for All&#8208;Organic RGB Visible Light Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Printed all&#8208;organic RGB VLC system is established from novel fluorescent self&#8208;encapsulated deep&#8208;blue L&#960;CPs with a remarkably fast decay times of &#8764;0.30 ns, achieving the transmission of PRBS signals and audio data at a rate of 1 Mbps. The fast response times, on the order of microseconds, further emphasize the suitability of these PLEDs for rapid data transmission applications.








ABSTRACT
All&#8208;organic red&#8208;green&#8208;blue (RGB) visible light communication (VLC) systems hold significant promise for future wireless communications because they can be readily integrated with existing lighting infrastructures. However, the stability, efficiency, and exciton decay times of printed deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) currently fall short of the high bandwidth, rapid response, and swift data transmission requirements of VLC systems. Herein, two printable deep&#8208;blue fluorescent light&#8208;emitting &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (L&#960;CPs) were fabricated based on a multi&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;encapsulation strategy for application in all&#8208;OLED RGB VLC systems. The printed fluorescent films displayed remarkably fast decay life&#8208;times of &#8764;0.30&#160;ns, enabling high bandwidth and fast response. The deep&#8208;blue OLEDs presented a CIE coordinate of (0.15, 0.06), narrow deep&#8208;blue emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 21&#160;nm, high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.94%, and high brightness of 6698&#160;cd/m2 with remarkable durability. Finally, preliminary printed all&#8208;OLED RGB VLC systems were successfully established, and through efficient energy transfer, demonstrated the transmission of pseudo&#8208;random binary sequence (PRBS) signals and audio data at a rate of 1&#160;Mbps. The fast response times, on the order of microseconds, highlight the potential of these all&#8208;OLED VLC systems for high&#8208;speed data transmission.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Modified Amorphous Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Ultra&#8208;Thin Nanosheets for Low&#8208;Overpotential and Long&#8208;Lifespan Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
By breaking the constraints of long&#8208;range order and symmetry found in crystalline solids, the topological amorphous structure generates numerous unsaturated coordination sites, which act as highly active centers for catalytic reactions. Meanwhile, the incorporation of nonmetallic sulfur (S) into noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloy (NHEA) amorphous nanosheets establishes Metal&#9472;S bonds with multiple transition metals, significantly enhancing catalytic performance in Li&#8208;O2 batteries.








ABSTRACT
While noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloys (NHEA) represent promising low&#8208;cost catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries, their catalytic capability is limited by the low metal&#8208;site utilization and unfavorable electronic structure inherent in conventional configurations. Herein, we report a novel design for a CuFeCoNiMn&#8208;NHEA catalyst, characterized by its entirely amorphous structure and the Metal&#9472;S bonds (especially Ni&#9472;S) introduced by S&#8208;doping. The successful synthesis of this catalyst relies on a rapid low&#8208;temperature strategy, where the 5&#176;C reaction temperature limits atomic diffusion and long&#8208;range ordering, while the sub&#8208;1&#8208;min duration kinetically traps the atoms in a disordered state. Within this architecture, the ultra&#8208;thin 2D morphology, disordered atomic arrangement, and unsaturated atomic coordination offer abundant active sites by eliminating constraints from crystal planes&#160;and boundaries; simultaneously, the Metal&#9472;S bonds significantly optimize the electronic structure. The electronegativity gradient between metal and S induces electron delocalization at metal sites, which lowers the d&#8208;band center and optimizes the adsorption energy of *LiO2 intermediates, thereby accelerating the redox kinetics. Meanwhile, strengthened Metal&#9472;S coordination elevates metal vacancy formation energies by 1&#8211;3 times, which suppresses atomic leaching to improve structural stability. Therefore, our unique catalyst achieves a low overpotential (0.48&#160;V), and an exceptional lifespan (452 cycles), significantly outperforming most reported noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts.

This work demonstrates a synergistic anion&#8211;cation (N&#9472;Mo) modulation strategy that produces a solid&#8208;state electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and suppressed electronic conduction. The in situ&#8211;formed dual&#8208;layer Li/electrolyte interphase&#8212;inner lithiophilic Li&#9472;Mo alloy and outer stable, highly ionically conductive Li3N layer, accompanied by minor byproducts with low conductivity&#8212;stabilizes Li&#8208;metal cycling and enables high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








ABSTRACT
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superionic conductivity and high compatibility with lithium&#8208;metal anode are essential for high specific energy all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. Here, we develop an argyrodite&#8208;type solid&#8208;state electrolyte that enables fast Li+ transport and excellent interfacial compatibility with Li metal through a cooperative anion&#8211;cation modulation strategy. A robust anodic interface is spontaneously formed via the in situ reaction between Li metal and the tailored electrolyte. The cation Mo introduced into the electrolyte can be reduced to form a lithiophilic Li&#8208;Mo alloy, while the anion N is capable of forming highly Li&#8208;compatible Li3N. These interfacial products promote uniform Li stripping/plating and suppress parasitic reactions at the anodic interface. Meanwhile, Mo incorporation weakens the strong N&#9472;Li electrostatic interaction, ensuring rapid Li+ migration within the electrolyte. The modulated electrolyte exhibits high dynamic stability and Li reversibility at the anodic side, enabling Li//Li symmetric cells to cycle stably for over 3100&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The Li//LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 batteries demonstrate an ultra&#8208;stable long cycle life with 75% capacity retention over 1500 cycles at 4C (3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), accompanied by an outstanding average coulombic efficiency of 99.99%. This work highlights an anion&#8211;cation cooperative modulation strategy for designing electrolytes that enable high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

The Li//LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries demonstrate an ultra-stable long cycle life with 75% capacity retention over 1500 cycles at 4C (3.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), accompanied by an outstanding average coulombic efficiency of 99.99%. This work highlights an anion&#8211;cation cooperative modulation strategy for designing electrolytes that enable high-performance all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Biomaterials for Augmenting Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered bacterial biomaterials, encompassing living bacteria and their acellular platforms like outer membrane vesicles, can efficiently reprogram the tumor microenvironment and synergize with current adoptive immune cell therapies such as CAR&#8208;T, CAR&#8208;macrophages, and CAR&#8208;NK cells, offering a programmable bacterial&#8208;based immune modulatory platform that enhances immune cell infiltration, activation, and persistence for augmented solid tumor control.








ABSTRACT
Adoptive immune cell therapy (ACT) represents one of the most promising strategies in cancer immunotherapy, leveraging genetically engineered immune cells to recognize and eradicate tumor cells with high specificity. Durable remissions have been achieved in hematological malignancies, particularly with CD19&#8208;targeted chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR&#8208;T) cell therapies. However, the efficacy of ACT in solid tumors remains limited due to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, tumor heterogeneity, and poor infiltration and persistence of the effector cells within tumor sites. Bacterial biomaterials, encompassing live bacteria and their acellular platforms, for example, outer membrane vesicles, represent emerging classes of programmable systems capable of reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment. In this review, we briefly illustrate the underlying molecular mechanisms by which bacterial biomaterials remodel the tumor environment and underscore the advances in the use of engineered bacterial biomaterials to enhance the efficacy of ACT in solid tumors, highlighting the underlying basic principles and engineering strategies to augment current adoptive cellular therapies for overcoming their faced dilemmas in solid tumor settings.

         <title>Material Preparation Information File (MPIF): A Community&#8208;Driven Standard for Reporting MOF Syntheses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Material Preparation Information File (MPIF) establishes a universal, community&#8208;driven format for documenting the synthesis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks and related materials. By capturing complete, machine&#8208;readable synthesis and characterization details, MPIF enhances reproducibility, supports FAIR data sharing, and bridges experimental chemistry with digital materials discovery and automation.








ABSTRACT
The rapid growth of research on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and related porous materials has highlighted a critical need for standardized reporting of synthetic procedures and material properties. Synthesis consistency is often compromised by incomplete protocols and inconsistent nomenclature, with even well&#8208;established MOFs exhibiting substantial variability depending on subtle and frequently unreported factors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce the Material Preparation Information File (MPIF), a modular, machine&#8208; and human&#8208;readable format for documenting synthesis protocols alongside key characterization data. Built on the Self&#8208;defining Text Archive and Retrieval (STAR) file architecture, MPIF consolidates essential information, including reagents, conditions, equipment, and handling procedures&#8212;into a structured format that supports both digital processing and practical laboratory use. To streamline MPIF creation and editing, a web&#8208;based interface has been developed (mpif.jackdevans.com). By aligning with existing standards such as CIF and AIF, MPIF enables integration with databases, promotes FAIR data principles, and provides a foundation for data&#8208;driven materials discovery, informatics, and automation. We envision MPIF becoming a community&#8208;wide standard for transparent and consistent reporting of MOF and related material syntheses.

         <title>In Situ Copper&#8208;Mediated Electron Bridge Revolutionizes Aqueous Sulfur&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ constructed copper&#8208;mediated electron bridge transforms semiconducting sulfur&#8208;based cathodes into highly conductive materials. Dynamic d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between copper and sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) promotes bandgap closure, creating metallic&#8208;like conductivity. The resulting CuSPAN cathode fundamentally accelerates redox kinetics and reinforces the electrode structure, enabling exceptional long&#8208;term stability and high energy density for aqueous sulfur&#8208;based batteries.








ABSTRACT
The practical application of sulfur&#8208;based batteries remains challenged by the sluggish charge transfer kinetics and structural instability of sulfur cathodes, largely attributed to the absence of efficient electron transport pathways and robust electrode architecture. Herein, we present an in situ electron bridge construction strategy by introducing a transition metal to tailor the electronic properties and reinforce the structure of sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) cathode. The dynamic d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between copper and SPAN within the electron bridge promotes bandgap closure, shifting the electronic character from a semiconducting state toward a metallic state, thereby establishing high&#8208;speed electron transfer channels and accelerating redox kinetics. Simultaneously, the self&#8208;assembled copper&#8208;modified SPAN (CuSPAN), driven by in situ thermodynamically&#8208;favorable process, intrinsically reinforces the cathode structure, conferring exceptional long&#8208;term operational stability. As a result, the aqueous CuSPAN&#8208;based battery achieves a high reversible capacity of 760 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C and outstanding cyclic stability with 79.2% capacity retention over 50&#160;000 cycles at 15 C, superior to previously reported aqueous sulfur batteries. To verify the practicality, a flexible pouch cell is built based on the CuSPAN cathode, Zn anode, and gel electrolytes, delivering a stable operating voltage (1.2&#160;V), high energy density (950&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and remarkable cycling stability even under various harsh conditions.

         <title>Emergent Freestanding Complex Oxide Membranes for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys freestanding oxide membranes and covers fabrication and three pathways for studies and devices: strain&#8208;free and strained membranes, and van der Waals&#8208;integrated heterostructures. We show how coupled oxide responses map onto these routes and cross&#8208;couple to expand behaviors. We identify barriers to scalable multifunctional devices and outline considerations for membrane quality, heterostructure construction, Si&#8208;compatible processing, and wafer&#8208;scale handling.








ABSTRACT
Correlated complex oxides feature tightly coupled charge, spin, orbital, and lattice degrees of freedom, which give rise to rich correlated behavior. Freestanding oxide membranes render these materials into tunable quasi&#8208;2D platforms that enable multifunctional and reconfigurable devices. This Review surveys recent advances in the research of freestanding oxide membranes, highlighting their coupled correlated properties. We focus on three development pathways: (i) strain&#8208;free membranes, (ii) strained membranes, and (iii) van der Waals&#8208;integrated heterostructures. This organization begins with the intrinsic properties of oxide membranes, then examines mechanical tuning, heterogeneous integration, and multiphysics coupling to provide a comprehensive account of the field's development. Finally, we evaluate practical challenges, including high&#8208;quality surfaces, robust multiphysics coupling, wafer&#8208;scale transfer, and silicon&#8208;compatible heterogeneous integration. Addressing these challenges will enable scalable, high&#8208;yield manufacturing and expand the design space for oxide&#8208;based architectures, thereby accelerating the transition from laboratory demonstrations to industry&#8208;ready systems.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Selective Anti&#8208;Perovskite Enables Breakthrough Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuNCo3 antiperovskite leverages built&#8208;in 3d&#8211;3d interactions to stabilize and generate spin&#8208;selective Co sites during nitrate reduction. Multiple operando techniques reveal that Cu acts as a promoter, inducing partial surface Co&#8208;N cleavage and Cu&#8208;Co charge redistribution. This dynamic restructuring tunes the activation and conversion of nitrate&#8208;derived intermediates, boosting overall catalytic efficiency and selectivity for ammonia formation.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia offers environmental and energy benefits, but progress is hindered by sluggish multistep proton&#8208;coupled electron transfers and competing side reactions. Here, we introduce an antiperovskite CuNCo3 catalyst featuring a 3d&#8211;3d interaction framework. This framework stabilizes spin&#8208;selective Co sites even upon surface Co&#8208;N bond cleavage and drives asymmetric nitrate consumption. CuNCo3 achieves 100% Faradaic efficiency and an NH3 production rate of 124.6&#160;mg&#160;mgcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V vs. RHE. Operando XAS, XES, and ATR&#8208;FTIR directly link the evolution of spin&#8208;selective Co sites with specific NO3RR intermediates, revealing that spin&#8208;selective Co sites lower hydrogenation barriers and accelerate key steps. These results demonstrate that spin&#8208;selective anti&#8208;perovskite frameworks provide a robust, earth&#8208;abundant platform for high&#8208;performance nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia offers environmental and energy benefits, but progress is hindered by sluggish multistep proton-coupled electron transfers and competing side reactions. Here, we introduce an antiperovskite CuNCo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst featuring a 3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;3&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; interaction framework. This framework stabilizes spin-selective Co sites even upon surface Co-N bond cleavage and drives asymmetric nitrate consumption. CuNCo&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; achieves 100% Faradaic efficiency and an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 124.6&#160;mg&#160;mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;0.4&#160;V vs. RHE. &lt;i&gt;Operando&lt;/i&gt; XAS, XES, and ATR-FTIR directly link the evolution of spin-selective Co sites with specific NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR intermediates, revealing that spin-selective Co sites lower hydrogenation barriers and accelerate key steps. These results demonstrate that spin-selective anti-perovskite frameworks provide a robust, earth-abundant platform for high-performance nitrate-to-ammonia electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Optical Tuning of Non&#8208;Equilibrium Surface Plasmon Resonances in a Narrow&#8208;Gap Semiconductor Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast all&#8208;optical tuning of non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances is accomplished in single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanosheets. By exciting multi&#8208;valence band transitions, a high plasmon frequency ceiling of 1435&#160;cm&#8722;1 and sub&#8208;6 ps optical switching are achieved, enabling compact 2&#960; phase control. These findings highlight the potential of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors for high&#8208;speed, programmable mid&#8208;infrared photonics.








Abstract
In photonics, the polaritonic nanocavity (PC) within the mid&#8208;infrared to terahertz region is pivotal in on&#8208;chip applications, spanning diverse domains such as bio&#8208;sensing and beyond&#8208;5G information processing. Nevertheless, the impediment posed by lattice vibrations' electrical neutrality restricts phononic PCs' active tuning through electro&#8208;optical methodologies. In response to this constraint, the potential of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors is investigated, which is characterized by highly efficient optical carrier incubation capabilities to facilitate all&#8208;optical plasmonic PC tuning. Leveraging ultrafast nanoscopy, the temporal evolution of non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic cavity modes is meticulously scrutinized in InSb nanosheets. These findings unveil that multi&#8208;valence band transitions engender substantial free carriers, culminating in optically tunable non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic cavity modes with a rapid switching capability of less than 6&#160;ps, affording facile 2&#960; plasmonic phase control. This study substantiates the prospect that conventional III&#8211;V semiconductors offer a robust platform for tunable transient surface plasmon resonances, thereby paving the way for innovative integrated optical applications seamlessly adapting to established semiconductor technologies.

         <title>Achieving Bichelating Solvation Structure toward Fast Charging and Long Lifespan Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, solvation structures are precisely regulated by leveraging steric hindrance effects to adjust molecular spatial configurations and polarization changes. The selective introduction of sodium succinate forms a bisolvation&#8208; sheath&#8208;bichelation (BSB) configuration, which facilitates rapid anion desolvation, optimizes SEI composition, enhances anode reversibility, and significantly improves battery cycle performance.








Abstract
Design optimized solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+ is an effective strategy for stabilizing Zn anodes and achieving decent performance for practical aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, the mechanism for precise targeted design of solvation structures remains unclear. This study employs a space&#8208;confined regulation strategy through carbon chain shortening and amino migration to unveil the correlation between molecular conformation evolution and solvent sheath design. The findings demonstrate that carbon chain shortening and amino migration synergistically induce steric hindrance decrement, driving the transition from monopolar configuration to bisolvation&#8208;sheath&#8208;bichelation (BSB) configuration. The BSB structure facilitates Zn2+ migration through electrostatic repulsion induced by dual Zn2+ coordination, while enhancing Zn deposition/stripping kinetics via competitive anion desolvation. As a result, the Zn//Zn symmetric cell exhibits decent rate capability up to 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability for 3600 hours under 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the BSB structure has shown substantial enhancement in the cycling stability of Zn//V2O5 cells with 80% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. This work not only offers a new bichelation solvation structure design strategy, but also provides insights for&#8203; electrolyte engineering in the related energy storage and conversion area.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Smart Phosphorescent Polymer Composites with Time&#8208;Dependent and Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
New reconfigurable smart phosphorescent polymer composites with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent color variation modulated by multiple stimuli are prepared, which promotes the development of smart security technologies with multi&#8208;dimensional and multi&#8208;level encryption capabilities.








ABSTRACT
Developing smart systems based on phosphorescent materials that can control the time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent color (TDPC) in response to external stimuli holds promise for advancing information encryption, but significant challenges remain. Herein, a facile strategy is proposed to construct smart phosphorescent polymer composites through immobilizing dual&#8208;emission centers with distinct stimuli sensitivities within a soft&#8208;rigid coupled hybrid matrix. The smart phosphorescent polymer composites show switchable phosphorescence between static phosphorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent dynamic TDPC, induced by multi&#8208;stimuli (light, humidity, heat). The photoactivated phosphorescent composites transform from initial static monochromatic emission to dynamic multicolor TDPC through the synergistic effect of triplet oxygen depletion&#8208;induced selective activation of the emission centers and the distinct decay rates of the dual&#8208;emission centers. The evolution paths of TDPC also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependence. Moreover, the photoactivated composites enable reversible switching between dynamic TDPC and monochromatic phosphorescence through water and thermal stimuli, due to the combined effects of water&#8208;induced dissociation of the rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and differential quenching of the dual&#8208;emission centers. The composites also exhibit recyclability and self&#8208;healing capability. The processable smart phosphorescent polymer composites with good stability demonstrate outstanding potential in multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption, opening up a new perspective for upgrading security technologies.

         <title>Observation of Topological Chirality Switching Induced Freezing of a Skyrmion Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using Lorentz Transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that in the insulating van der Waals ferromagnet, CrBr3, a magnetic field can cause Bloch skyrmionic bubbles to spontaneously switch their chirality. As achiral type&#8208;II bubbles are an intermediate state, the bubbles rapidly elongate and shrink when switching, thereby inducing a freezing of the overall bubble lattice. The control over skyrmion chirality and order shown here can allow the creation of designer skyrmion crystals for utilization in unconventional computing.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected quasi&#8208;particles with a well&#8208;defined chirality. Control over their chirality is proposed as an additional feature for encoding data bits or as qubits in quantum computing due to their high efficiency and stability against achiral magnetic textures. Here it is shown that an in&#8208;plane magnetic field can be utilized to reshape the energy barriers between different skyrmionic bubbles (e.g., Bloch type, type&#8208;II) enabling spontaneous chirality fluctuations with a frequency that increases with the strength of the in&#8208;plane field. The insulating van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr3 is used as an archetypal system for low damping, reduced energy dissipation and a high number of magnetic phases to capture the chirality dynamics in real time through cryo&#8208;Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. It is observed that the interplay between the intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane field biased the chirality dynamics, favoring one handedness over the other. A remarkable consequence of the spontaneous chirality switching mechanism is that it induces a freezing (or crystallization) process in the skyrmion lattice. As the bubbles fluctuate between Bloch and type&#8208;II they elongate and shrink parallel to the in&#8208;plane field. Subsequently, the overall lattice crystallizes along the in&#8208;plane field direction, inducing a phase transition from a disordered liquid state to a hexatic phase where skyrmions are highly ordered resembling that of a solid. The results indicate chirality as an active element in the creation of topologically protected skyrmion crystals unveiling pathways toward chiral spintronic device platforms with tunable embedded&#160;configuration.

Control over their chirality is proposed as an additional feature for encoding data bits or as qubits in quantum computing due to their high efficiency and stability against achiral magnetic textures. Here it is shown that an in-plane magnetic field can be utilized to reshape the energy barriers between different skyrmionic bubbles (e.g., Bloch type, type-II) enabling spontaneous chirality fluctuations with a frequency that increases with the strength of the in-plane field. The insulating van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is used as an archetypal system for low damping, reduced energy dissipation and a high number of magnetic phases to capture the chirality dynamics in real time through cryo-Lorentz transmission electron microscopy.

         <title>Circularly Polarized Polariton Lasing from Spin&#8208;Momentum Locking in Deformed Plasmonic Kagome Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper describes room&#8208;temperature polariton lasing with high circular polarization from deformed plasmonic Kagome lattice cavities strongly coupled to colloidal CdSe nanoplatelets. Spin&#8208;selectivity from cavity modes resulted in control over the handedness of circular polarization as well as the direction of polariton lasing, opening prospects for exploring optical analogues of spin and valley physics.








Abstract
This paper describes room&#8208;temperature polariton lasing with high circular polarization from plasmonic Kagome lattice cavities strongly coupled to colloidal semiconducting quantum wells. By shrinking and expanding the trimer unit cells in Al nanoparticle lattices, the inversion symmetry is broken, resulting in the spin&#8208;momentum locking of cavity photons. Circularly polarized lattice resonances emerged from crossings of different diffraction orders, denoted as T points, along the &#915;&#8208;K direction in momentum space and whose degree of circular polarization is higher than those of high&#8208;symmetry K&#8208;points. Deformed Kagome lattice cavities combined with CdSe nanoplatelets enabled the formation of exciton&#8208;polaritons. Spin&#8208;selectivity from cavity modes resulted in control over the handedness of circular polarization as well as direction of photoluminescence from lower polaritons. Six lasing beams from T points has alternating handedness, low thresholds (8&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2), and high degrees of circular polarization (&#8776;0.7). The anticipation that spin&#8208;momentum locking via plasmonic Kagome lattices can be extended to other non&#8208;Bravais metasurfaces with hexagonal symmetries and opens prospects for exploring optical analogues of spin and valley physics.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Melt Consolidation of Aerospace&#8208;Grade Thermoplastic Composites for High&#8208;Rate Processing</title>

Integrating amorphous PEI sheaths with semicrystalline PEEK, selectively thinned by picosecond laser ablation to form PEI&#8211;PEEK blending regions, creates a Goldilocks consolidation window that preserves crystallinity, minimizes resin&#8208;rich interlayers, and enables vacuum&#8208;bag&#8208;only processing at 300&#160;&#176;C&#8212;achieving fivefold faster consolidation and reducing energy use by 75% relative to conventional processing methods for aerospace&#8208;grade thermoplastic composites.








Abstract
The processing of thermoplastic composites is often limited by high energy demands and slow cycle times. Out&#8208;of&#8208;autoclave amorphous/crystalline thermoplastic materials for energy&#8208;efficient aerospace&#8208;grade laminates (OATMEAL) addresses these challenges through a unique prepreg architecture. OATMEAL consists of slow&#8208;cooled carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced semicrystalline polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tape sheathed in thin amorphous polyetherimide (PEI) layers. The PEI sheaths are miscible with PEEK and enable interfacial healing below the melting point of PEEK&#8212;preserving pre&#8208;existing crystallinity and reducing processing temperatures by 80&#160;&#176;C. The sheaths are thinned via high&#8208;frequency laser ablation down to the PEEK&#8211;PEI blending regions, thereby reducing residual stresses and promoting chemical resistance. Fast&#8208;cooled vacuum&#8208;bag&#8208;only oven processing of OATMEAL laminates yields aerospace&#8208;quality parts while enabling processing speeds more than five times faster and reducing energy use by roughly 75% compared with conventional methods. These results represent a significant advancement and a step toward truly high&#8208;rate, large&#8208;scale aerostructure manufacturing.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Synapses with High Linearity for Intelligent Computing in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;adaptive artificial synapse (PAAS) is developed based on VO2 nanoparticles, capable of neuromorphic computing under extreme high pressures up to &#8776;15 GPa.








Abstract
The ongoing exploration of the physical world has intensified the demand for intelligent computing in extreme environments. However, intelligent devices operating under extreme high&#8208;pressure conditions are limited by the pressure tolerance of the materials used for intelligent computing. A pressure&#8208;adaptive artificial synapse (PAAS) using VO2 (M1) nanoparticles is developed, leveraging the increased lattice rigidity during the M1&#8208;to&#8208;M1&#8217; phase transition (1 atm to 15.1&#160;GPa), which causes the photoinduced insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition to be Mott dominated. The PAAS demonstrated a stable operating current, a superior biomimetic plasticity (maximum paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index from 109.6% to 155.4%), and an improved postsynaptic current linearity (Pearson's r from 0.64 to 0.97) from 1 atm to 15.1&#160;GPa. Furthermore, an artificial neural network mapped by PAAS under high pressure achieved a validation accuracy of 95%&#8211;97% in handwritten digit recognition. The PAAS is also applied to a convolutional autoencoder for denoising reconstruction of color images.

         <title>Embedding Cu4X4 Cubane Clusters into Lead Halide Lattices: Stable 3D Cu&#8208;Pb Bimetallic Halide Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two aqueous&#8208;stable 3D MI/MII bimetallic (CuI/PbII) halides are successfully synthesized through multi&#8208;component coordination&#8208;driven assembly, featuring cubane&#8208;type [Cu4X4] clusters covalently encapsulated in 3D lead halide frameworks. Both materials exhibit exceptional selectivity in photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion, attributed to the embedded [Cu4X4] modules enhancing carrier&#8208;transport kinetics and forming charge&#8208;polarized PbII&#9472;X&#9472;CuI active sites.








Abstract
3D hybrid lead halides have emerged as promising photofunctional materials; however, the 3D structural prototypes remain scarce due to the stringent requirements for organic cations to fit within the framework cavities and stabilize PbX6 networks. Moreover, their ionic&#8208;bound nature and highly symmetric PbX6 units often result in structural instability and suppressed C&#9472;C coupling capabilities, posing significant challenges for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion in aqueous environments. Herein, a heterometallic crystal engineering strategy is presented for the coordination&#8208;driven assembly of two 3D MI/MII bimetallic halides with the general formula Pb6Cu4X10(ida)3 (ida = iminodiacetate, X = Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;). The embedding of cubane&#8208;type [Cu4X4] clusters within the lead halide frameworks via covalent PbII&#8211;X&#8211;CuI linkages result in decreased exciton binding energies, smaller Huang&#8211;Rhys factors, and extended photoluminescence lifetimes, which suppress exciton trapping and facilitate carrier transport. Both MI/MII halide frameworks feature asymmetric, halogen&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic sites (PbII&#9472;X&#9472;CuI) with intrinsic charge polarization, which facilitate C&#9472;C coupling during CO2 photoreduction by stabilizing the key *COCOH intermediates. As a result, these heterobimetallic architectures enable highly selective photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion, achieving up to 95% selectivity in pure water. This work demonstrates a viable strategy for atomic&#8208;level engineering of 3D metal halides toward solar&#8208;driven C2 fuel production.

&lt;p&gt;Two aqueous-stable 3D &lt;i&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; bimetallic (Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;) halides are successfully synthesized through multi-component coordination-driven assembly, featuring cubane-type [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] clusters covalently encapsulated in 3D lead halide frameworks. Both materials exhibit exceptional selectivity in photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; conversion, attributed to the embedded [Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;X&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] modules enhancing carrier-transport kinetics and forming charge-polarized Pb&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;&#9472;X&#9472;Cu&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; active sites.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D hybrid lead halides have emerged as promising photofunctional materials; however, the 3D structural prototypes remain scarce due to the stringent requirements for organic cations to fit within the framework cavities and stabilize PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; networks. Moreover, their ionic-bound nature and highly symmetric PbX&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; units often result in structural instability and suppressed C&#9472;C coupling capabilities, posing significant challenges for photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; conversion in aqueous environments. Herein, a heterometallic crystal engineering strategy is presented for the coordination-driven assembly of two 3D &lt;i&gt;M&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt;/M&lt;sup&gt;II&lt;/sup&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Strategy of Targeted Capture and Potential Responsive Release for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively proposes a synergistic strategy of &#8220;targeted capture and potential responsive release&#8221;. By utilizing Bi2O3 to selectively capture I&#8722; and form BiOI, followed by their release at lower potentials, the strategy effectively suppresses shuttle behavior through the delayed release of I&#8722;, thereby enhancing the battery's cycling stability and capacity. 








Abstract
The shuttle effect, arising from the dissolution and migration of polyiodide species, severely hinders the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#9472;I2) batteries. Conventional carbon&#8208;based cathode materials, relying on weak physical adsorption, fail to effectively confine iodine species. To address this issue, a synergistic strategy is proposed that combines the targeted capture of I&#8722; to form BiOI with the potential responsive release of I&#8722; from BiOI during the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi. This approach enables a dynamic and directional capture&#8208;release process at a potential lower than that required for the reduction of I2. This methodology is validated through ex situ spectroscopic analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This decoupled mechanism suppresses polyiodide formation and ensures efficient cathode reversibility. The incorporation of Bi2O3 also introduces an additional redox couple, contributing extra capacity to the battery. The battery not only efficiently suppresses the inherent side reaction issues of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, but also achieves a considerably high capacity level in the field of iodine single&#8208;electron conversion. This work provides a universal design principle for manipulating iodine electrochemistry, paving the way for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;lifespan halogen&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Tunnel Thin&#8208;Film Transistors for Ultralow&#8208;Power and High&#8208;Performance Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a new device concept, a flexible tunnel thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT), operating with a band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling injection mechanism, which breaks the fundamental thermionic limit of subthreshold swing in traditional thin&#8208;film transistors. The new tunnel TFT achieves ultralow&#8208;power and high&#8208;performance flexible electronics, making up a missing piece of the puzzle on the technology roadmap for flexible organic electronics.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are the cornerstone of large&#8208;area electronics, yet their capacity to enable low&#8208;power flexible technologies has been stifled by a fundamental constraint: the thermionic limit, which restricts the subthreshold swing (SS) to &#8776;60&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 at room temperature. This intrinsic barrier has persisted as a critical bottleneck, impeding advancements in applications from wearable sensors to low&#8208;power flexible electronics. Here, flexible tunnel TFTs that harness quantum band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling are reported to transcend this fundamental limit. This tunnel TFTs, fabricated on an ultrathin (6 &#181;m) flexible substrate, deliver subthermionic SS (28.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) with a large intrinsic gain (&#8776;104) under a mere 1&#160;V operating voltage. By using a protective layer&#8208;assisted photolithography method, flexible tunnel TFT active&#8208;matrix arrays, flexible amplifiers, and various flexible logic circuits are successfully fabricated. The flexible tunnel TFT array can be bent multiple times with negligible degradation to a radius as small as 50 &#181;m. The flexible amplifier shows a high gain of 1000&#160;V/V, enabling the acquisition of high&#8208;quality electromyography signals with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 77&#160;dB. All the logic circuits demonstrate accurate Boolean output functionalities at picowatt&#8208;level power consumption, opening a new device concept for energy&#8208;efficient flexible electronics.

A high&#8208;current hydrovoltaic device based on mesh&#8208;structured, dual&#8208;functional core&#8211;shell Ag/AgX reversible electrodes achieves Faradaic&#8208;driven ion&#8208;electron transduction and programmable electrical outputs via localized charge inversion, delivering 26.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 current density, 3.9&#160;mW m&#8722;2 power density, and stable operation across 10&#8722;6&#8211;100&#160;mol L&#8722;1 ionic environments for versatile self&#8208;powered sensing and energy applications.








Abstract
Harvesting energy from water evaporation through hydrovoltaic devices provides a sustainable approach to electricity generation and decentralized power solutions. However, practical performance remains limited by low&#8208;current outputs (&lt;100 nA cm&#8722;2) and operation restricted to low&#8208;ionic&#8208;strength conditions (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;M). Here, dual&#8208;function, mesh&#8208;structured core&#8211;shell Ag/AgX reversible electrodes are developed to construct high&#8208;current hydrovoltaic devices operable across diverse ionic environments. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed AgX shell mediates redox&#8208;driven interfacial ion&#8208;electron transduction, while the Ag core provides high&#8208;speed electronic pathways, synergistically promoting the efficient conversion of ionic migration into continuous electron flow. Leveraging the localized charge inversion effect, programmable electrical outputs in both magnitude and polarity are obtained further. By co&#8208;designing Ag/AgI electrodes with KI&#8208;based electrolytes, this device delivers a record&#8208;high current density of 26.0 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 sustained over 160 h with power density exceeding 3.9&#160;mW m&#8722;2, &#8776;260&#8208;fold higher current and &#8776;39&#8208;fold greater power than previously reported inert&#8208;electrode&#8208;based systems. Moreover, the solid&#8208;liquid interfacial charge inversion enables tunable ion transport and reconfigurable nanochannel selectivity, realizing programmable outputs over an extensive ionic&#8208;concentration window (10&#8722;6&#8211;100&#160;M) and multiple ionic species. This strategy implements versatile energy&#8208;sensing systems capable of powering electronics and supporting diversified self&#8208;powered monitoring across natural and industrial water sources.

This strategy implements versatile energy-sensing systems capable of powering electronics and supporting diversified self-powered monitoring across natural and industrial water sources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity and Low&#8208;Latency Machine Vision via Manipulation of Contact Potential Behaviors at Perovskite Hetero&#8208;Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite photodetectors are promising for advanced machine vision, but struggled by a persistent speed&#8208;efficiency trade&#8208;off. This work identifies the fundamental domination of transport&#8208;limited mechanism and reconfigures interfacial energetics using polymer&#8208;polarized passive dipoles. The resulting devices simultaneously achieve nanosecond response (23.8&#160;ns) and high efficiency (&gt;88%), enabling high&#8208;fidelity, low&#8208;latency imaging for robotics and autonomous perception systems.








Abstract
Artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven machine vision is reshaping the industrial perception paradigm, highlighting the critical demands of high&#8208;performance vision hardware. Among various emerging vision techniques, perovskite photodetectors have demonstrated exceptional promise but faced a long&#8208;term trade&#8208;off between external quantum efficiency (EQE) and response time, posing a significant challenge for high&#8208;fidelity and low&#8208;latency vision applications. Here, the transport&#8208;limited mechanism is confirmed to fundamentally dominates response time, and high&#8208;bandwidth and high&#8208;sensitivity perovskite photodiodes are demonstrated by manipulating contact potential behaviors through polymer&#8208;polarized passive dipoles. Specifically, the synergistic incorporation of dipole&#8208;rich molecular modifiers with polar functional groups and electronegative atoms effectively rearranges charge distribution, leading to an increased potential difference and homogeneous potential profiles at perovskite hetero&#8208;interfaces. Accordingly, reduced conduction and valence band offsets facilitate carrier transport and suppress non&#8208;radiative recombination. The device simultaneously delivers an impressive bandwidth of 25.7&#160;MHz and a high EQE exceeding 88%, enabling a high&#8208;fidelity and low&#8208;latency imaging of fast rotating motion (&#8776;18&#160;750&#160;rpm) with negligible ghosting. This work provides an effective strategy to approach the transport limit of vision hardware, laying a solid foundation for next&#8208;generation AI scenarios.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Reconstructed Ru&#8208;Clusters on FeOOH&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Peroxisome with Programmed ROS Regulation for Infectious and Inflammatory Chronic Wounds</title>

         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;reconstructed Ru&#8208;clusters on FeOOH&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisomes (LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH) have been designed for programmed reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation in treating infectious and inflammatory chronic wounds. These studies demonstrate that this LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH displays pH&#8208;switchable ROS&#8208;catalytic behaviors, which demonstrate coordinated antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and pro&#8208;angiogenic functions, enabling a logically sequenced therapeutic progression from infection control to inflammation resolution and ultimately tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Chronic refractory wounds present substantial clinical difficulties, owing to their complex wound microenvironments featuring bacterial colonization, sustained inflammation, and deficient angiogenesis. Existing treatment options often fall short of concurrently overcoming these interconnected obstacles, underscoring the demand for integrated therapeutic platforms that combine antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and pro&#8208;angiogenic properties. Drawing inspiration from natural peroxisomes, a lattice&#8208;reconstructed Ru&#8208;clusters are designed on FeOOH&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisome with programmed reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for infectious and inflammatory chronic wounds. Within this architecture, electron&#8208;rich Ru clusters and hole&#8208;rich FeOOH domains establish an efficient electron&#8208;transfer network. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that this distinctive electronic structure lowers reaction energy barriers, enabling pH&#8208;switchable ROS&#8208;catalytic behaviors. Under acidic wound pH, LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH catalyzes ROS generation to disrupt bacterial metabolism and eliminate infections, while under neutral conditions, it efficiently scavenges ROS to alleviate oxidative stress and support tissue repair, enabling a logically sequenced therapeutic progression from infection control to inflammation resolution. In vivo experiments using diabetic foot ulcers confirmed that LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH significantly enhanced bacterial clearance, attenuated inflammatory responses, stimulated neovascularization, and accelerated wound closure. These results position LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH as an artificial peroxisome with stage&#8208;specific therapies and promising translational potential for the treatment of refractory diabetic wounds and other infection&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Network Enables Sustainable Polyethylene for Next&#8208;Generation Cable Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene is post&#8208;functionalized through a copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H amination, and dynamic covalent chemistry is subsequently employed to construct a new dynamic cross&#8208;linked polyethylene insulation. The material maintains cable&#8208;level electrical and mechanical properties, enables thermal self&#8208;healing after electrical and mechanical damage, and shows good recyclability, making it suitable for sustainable power cable insulation applications.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE) with favorable electrical and mechanical properties is a key component of high voltage power transmission. However, damages caused by strong electrical and high mechanical stresses tend to initiate structural degradation of insulating materials, which in severe cases can lead to catastrophic failure of equipment. The irreversible curing property of XLPE presents significant challenges in self&#8208;healing after damage and recycling after decommissioning. Herein, an innovative strategy is developed that utilizes Cu&#8208;catalyzed amination to synthesize functionalized polyethylene, combined with dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare tailorable covalent adaptable networks (CANs). Due to the exchange of dual dynamic covalent bonds, the prepared CANs exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling properties, with performance recovery efficiency close to 100% after mechanical and electrical damage. Furthermore, the ingeniously designed structure of CANs, which combines &#8220;strong&#8221; permanent cross&#8208;linking with &#8220;weak&#8221; dynamic cross&#8208;linking, achieves a higher toughness of 102.0&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and excellent electrical insulation properties (electric field distortion rate of only 7% at 70&#160;&#176;C) than XLPE. This work promotes the environmental friendliness and long life of XLPE, paving the way for a new generation of sustainable cable insulation.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Na2S Growth: A Step Toward High&#8208;Energy and Safer Room Temperature Sodium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ &#160;characterizations reveal that atomic Mo catalytically lowers the formation temperature of Na2S/C during the carbothermic reduction process. Moreover, atomic Mo can modulate the bandgap of Na2S and reduce its reaction barriers with polysulfides. As a result, the obtained Mo&#8208;Na2S/C composite can be coupled with hard carbon to construct a safe sodium&#8208;metal&#8208;free Na&#9472;S battery.








Abstract
The Na2S cathode presents a promising metal&#8208;free sodium configuration for high&#8208;energy room&#8208;temperature sodium sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries. However, the rational design of Na2S cathodes to overcome their poor electronic conductivity and sluggish conversion kinetics remains a major challenge. Here, an&#160;in situ&#160;carbothermic reduction strategy is reported to fabricate atomic Mo anchored on Na2S/C (including single Mo atom and Mo clusters) as cathode materials for RT Na&#9472;S batteries.&#160;In situ&#160;transmission electron microscopy and&#160;X&#8208;ray diffraction technique reveal that atomic Mo could form a low&#8208;temperature eutectic phase, which catalytically lowers the formation temperature of Na2S. This Mo&#8208;Na2S/C exhibits remarkable cyclic stability, achieving an initial capacity of 1617 mAh g&#8722;1&#160;at 0.1 A g&#8722;1&#160;and a low activation voltage of 1.89&#160;V. Notably, when paired with hard carbon, the&#160;safe sodium full cell&#160;delivers&#160;an impressive initial reversible capacity of 952 mAh g&#8722;1. Experimental results and&#160;theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that the atomic Mo facilitates the interfacial electron transfer between Mo and Na2S, which modulates the bandgap of Na2S and reduces its reaction barriers to polysulfide, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. These findings offer an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance Na2S cathodes and provide deeper insights into electrode preparation mechanisms.

Experimental results and&#160;theoretical&#160;calculations reveal that the atomic Mo facilitates the interfacial electron transfer between Mo and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, which modulates the bandgap of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and reduces its reaction barriers to polysulfide, thereby enhancing the reaction kinetics. These findings offer an effective strategy for developing high-performance Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S cathodes and provide deeper insights into electrode preparation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesoporous High&#8208;Entropy Oxides Nanoplatform Decodes Paired&#8208;Plasma Metabolic Fingerprinting of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous high&#8208;entropy oxides (mHEO) nanoparticles with an ordered open channel are synthesized and first used as matrix materials to detect small molecular metabolites. Based on the mHEO nanoparticles&#8208;driven detection, the platform shows high sensitivity, reproducibility, and low detection limits. Paired analysis of plasma metabolites in pancreatic cancer decodes the dynamic metabolic changes and identifies potential biomarkers, enabling precise diagnosis and treatment.








Abstract
Accurate detection of small molecule metabolites in vivo is critical for rapid screening of disease biomarkers and health monitoring. Matrix&#8208;assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI&#8208;MS) has emerged as a promising platform for metabolic profiling, but its capability is hindered by the limited light absorption and energy transfer of conventional matrix materials. In this work, a high&#8208;efficiency metabolic detection platform based on high&#8208;entropy oxide particles (mHEO) with an interconnected mesoporous structure and tailored compositions is established. Owing to their abundant active sites and excellent light utilization efficiency, the mHEO particles show significantly improved photothermal and photochemical properties with an eightfold localized enhanced electromagnetic field and higher surface temperatures (616&#160;&#176;C) than nonporous HEOs (336&#160;&#176;C). As a result, MALDI&#8208;MS based on the mHEO matrix exhibits high sensitivity, good reproducibility (Coefficient of Variation &lt; 10%), and ultralow detection limits with 1&#8211;3 orders of magnitude lower than their endogenous concentrations. Furthermore, the mHEO&#8208;based MALDI&#8208;MS platform is applied to analyze paired arterial/venous blood samples from pancreatic cancer (PC) patients with the assistance of machine learning. Four tumor microenvironment&#8208;associated metabolites are identified as a potential biomarker panel of PC, achieving a robust pancreas&#8208;venous plasma classification, which allows the timely screening and targeted treatment of PC.

         <title>Effective Degradation of Wild&#8208;Type and Mutant EGFR Using Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide&#8208;Derived PROTAC Nanoparticles (NanoTACs) for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling NanoTACs accumulate in tumors and engage EGFR with multivalent binding, driving rapid endocytosis and intracellular PROTAC release. Dual lysosomal and proteasomal degradation eliminates both membrane&#8208;bound and cytosolic EGFR, including mutant forms that confer resistance. This coordinated mechanism suppresses EGFR signaling, overcomes monoclonal antibody and tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and supports potent therapeutic activity in refractory tumors.








Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeted therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have achieved clinical success but are limited by drug resistance and off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (NanoTACs) engineered for effective degradation of both wild&#8208;type and mutant EGFR for cancer therapy is reported. The NanoTACs are constructed from three peptide components: EGFR&#8208;binding peptide (EHGAMEI), a self&#8208;assembling peptide linker (FF), and an E3 ligase recruiting peptide (ALAPYIP). Through the hydrophobic interaction and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;derived PROTACs formed uniform spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 144&#160;nm under aqueous conditions. In vitro, NanoTACs effectively eliminated both wild&#8208;type and L858R/T790M&#8208;mutant EGFR in cancer cells through direct lysosomal degradation and PROTAC&#8208;driven proteasomal degradation. In vivo, NanoTACs exhibited 2.24&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency than free EGFR&#8208;binding peptide via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and EGFR&#8208;mediated active targeting. In colon and lung tumor models, NanoTACs suppressed tumor growth by 88.3%, achieved 95% degradation of wild&#8208;type and 80% of mutant EGFR, and induced extensive apoptosis without systemic toxicity. These findings established NanoTACs as a promising EGFR&#8208;targeted platform to overcome drug resistance to mAbs and TKIs by enabling effective degradation of wild&#8208;type and mutant EGFR in heterogeneous cancers.

         <title>Synergistic Cu2 and Polyoxometalate Clusters in Metal&#8211;Organic Layers Enable Oxidant&#8208;Free CH4 Photooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;defined bicluster photocatalyst, Cu2POFMn/PCN, integrates di&#8208;copper clusters and MnMo6 POMs in ultrathin MOLs on PCN nanoflakes for selective CH4 oxidation. Without oxidant addition, the optimized Cu2POFMn/PCN&#8208;8 achieves 10.5&#160;mmol gPOF&#8722;1 HCOOH yield with 95% selectivity.








Abstract
Methane (CH4) photooxidation under mild conditions represents a transformative approach for sustainable production of fuel and chemicals, however, it remains challenging due to the persistent requirement for exogenous oxidants. Herein, this study reports a series of well&#8208;defined bicluster photocatalysts Cu2POFMn/PCN&#8208;n (n = 1/5/8/10, denoting the mass ratio of PCN: Cu2POFMn), constructed by integrating [Cu(&#181;2&#8208;I)]2 (denoted as Cu2) clusters and MnMo6 polyoxometalates (POMs) within ultrathin metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs) anchored on PCN nanoflakes. The optimized Cu2POFMn/PCN&#8208;8 photocatalyst achieves efficient CH4 conversion to HCOOH with 10.5&#160;mmol gPOF&#8722;1 yield and 95% selectivity without any exogenous oxidant. Comprehensive studies demonstrated that the engineered MOLs architecture enables uniform and ordered assembly of complementary catalytic bicluster, where MnMo6 POMs act as electron reservoirs to promote charge separation for in situ H2O2 generation, and Cu2 clusters mimic CH4 monooxygenase to selectively cleave C&#8722;H bonds via forming Cu2&#8722;O&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;CH3 intermediate. This work highlights the vital role of MOL&#8208;directed bicluster assembly for C&#8211;H functionalization that bypasses the need for sacrificial oxidants in selective CH4 functionalization.

         <title>Supramolecular Coupling Effect Enhanced Highly Transparent, Conductive Ionic Skin for Underwater Sensory and Interactive Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underwater ionogel&#8208;based electronics face a typical trade&#8208;off among conductivity, transparency and sensitivity. Herein, a hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel engineered is reported with tert&#8208;butyl groups, which exhibits high transparency (96.38%) and ion conductivity (1.74 mS cm&#8722;1) benefited by supramolecular interactions. By integrating into a suspended 3D morphing structure, the obtained ionogel can achieve an ultra&#8208;high pressure sensitivity of &#8776;2.9 Pa, enabling flow field perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance in underwater robots.








Abstract
Soft electronics based on polymeric gels with unique optical, mechanical and electrical properties are of crucial importance in marine resource exploration. Hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel that combines with optical transparency, flexibility and conductivity is considered a promising potential. However, current soft ionogels struggle to meet the requirements of high electrical conductivity, transparency and perception sensitivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, a novel fluorinated polymeric ionogel is developed incorporated with tert&#8208;butyl groups and hydrophobic ionic liquid. Benefiting from the strong supramolecular dipole interaction of fluorine atoms and the hydrogen bond of tert&#8208;butyl ester, this designed polymeric ionogel exhibits both high transparency (96.38%) and enhanced ion mobility (1.74 mS cm&#8722;1). To further achieve high sensitivity, a suspended 3D morphing mechanism is proposed to construct an underwater camouflage skin with ultra&#8208;high underwater sensitivity (&#8776;2.9&#160;Pa), which enables capturing flow field gradients, tracking biological motion, and precisely localizing disturbance sources. As a demo, the ionogel&#8208;based suspended underwater electronic device is integrated into a dolphin&#8208;inspired untethered robot and further showed the closed&#8208;loop control capability of danger perception, decision and autonomous avoidance, demonstrating significant promise in underwater bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.

Herein, a hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel engineered is reported with tert-butyl groups, which exhibits high transparency (96.38%) and ion conductivity (1.74 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) benefited by supramolecular interactions. By integrating into a suspended 3D morphing structure, the obtained ionogel can achieve an ultra-high pressure sensitivity of &#8776;2.9 Pa, enabling flow field perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance in underwater robots.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft electronics based on polymeric gels with unique optical, mechanical and electrical properties are of crucial importance in marine resource exploration. Hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel that combines with optical transparency, flexibility and conductivity is considered a promising potential. However, current soft ionogels struggle to meet the requirements of high electrical conductivity, transparency and perception sensitivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, a novel fluorinated polymeric ionogel is developed incorporated with tert-butyl groups and hydrophobic ionic liquid. Benefiting from the strong supramolecular dipole interaction of fluorine atoms and the hydrogen bond of tert-butyl ester, this designed polymeric ionogel exhibits both high transparency (96.38%) and enhanced ion mobility (1.74 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). To further achieve high sensitivity, a suspended 3D morphing mechanism is proposed to construct an underwater camouflage skin with ultra-high underwater sensitivity (&#8776;2.9&#160;Pa), which enables capturing flow field gradients, tracking biological motion, and precisely localizing disturbance sources. As a demo, the ionogel-based suspended underwater electronic device is integrated into a dolphin-inspired untethered robot and further showed the closed-loop control capability of danger perception, decision and autonomous avoidance, demonstrating significant promise in underwater bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Hydrophobic Buried Interfaces for Achieving Moisture&#8208;Resistant Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 26.38% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing hydrophobic coating (SHC), constructed from supramolecular polymer embedded with SiO2 nanoparticles, serves as a moisture barrier while directing perovskite crystallization. Flexible devices incorporating SHC achieve a record efficiency of 26.38% (25.74% certified) and demonstrate exceptional durability, retaining over 80% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h at 85% relative humidity&#160;and satisfying the IPX7 waterproofing standard under full immersion.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are promising candidates to complement silicon photovoltaics; however, their stability remains far below industrial standards, particularly under long&#8208;term moisture exposure caused by water permeation through permeable plastic substrates. Although conventional hydrophobic interlayers can block water, they are generally incompatible with polar perovskite precursor solutions and are thus unsuitable for use beneath perovskite films. Here, a self&#8208;healing hydrophobic coating (SHC) is introduced that integrates a supramolecular polymer with dynamic imine cross&#8208;linking and SiO2 nanoparticles as a buried interfacial barrier. The SHC combines strong hydrophobicity, a low water vapor transmission rate, and exceptional self&#8208;healing ability, preserving its protective function even after surface treatment and perovskite deposition. Beyond suppressing moisture permeation, the SHC interacts with PbI2 to modulate the orientation of PbI2 layers, thus directing perovskite crystallization toward compact stacking, reduced residual PbI2, and preferential crystal orientation. Consequently, SHC&#8208;modified flexible pero&#8208;SCs achieve a record efficiency of 26.38% (25.74% certified) and 24.80% for small&#8208;area (0.062 cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.004 cm2) devices. The devices also demonstrate outstanding stability, maintaining 81.18% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h at 85% relative humidity and passing the IPX7 waterproofing standard under complete immersion.

         <title>Sulfone Molecular Switch Enables Direct Two&#8208;Electron Uranium Photoreduction in Programmed Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a &#8220;sulfone switch&#8221; in COFs that shifts the uranium photoreduction from an indirect to a direct two&#8208;electron pathway. This molecular&#8208;level strategy promotes exciton dissociation and charge separation, stabilizes key *UO2 intermediates, as well as suppressed &#8226;O2&#8722; generation, establishing a new paradigm for controlling photocatalytic reactions.








Abstract
Photocatalytic uranium extraction from seawater is indispensable for sustainable nuclear energy, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the prevailing indirect superoxide&#8208;mediated reduction pathway, which suffers from sluggish kinetics, oxygen dependency, and poor selectivity. Herein, it is demonstrated that a molecular&#8208;level &#8220;sulfone switch&#8221;, integrated into a covalent organic framework via edge&#8208;hanging engineering, orchestrates a decisive shift from the indirect to a direct two&#8208;electron transfer pathway for uranium photoreduction. The optimized Py&#8208;DaSO&#8208;COF achieves a remarkable uranium extraction capacity of 21.25&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in natural seawater, which is coupled with rapid kinetics and high selectivity against vanadium ions, surpassing most reported photocatalytic systems. Notably, combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the electron&#8208;deficient thiophene sulfone group promotes exciton dissociation, stabilizes key *UO2 intermediates, and suppresses &#8226;O2&#8722; generation by diverting electrons directly to adsorbed uranium species. This work establishes a versatile molecular engineering strategy for controlling photocatalytic pathways, highlighting its universal significance for solar&#8208;driven resource recovery and beyond.

         <title>Modular Opto&#8208;Magnetic Oscillators: Harnessing Light to Drive Versatile Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a universal, modular strategy that achieves self&#8208;sustained oscillation through a light&#8211;magnet&#8208;mechanics feedback loop. This plug&#8208;and&#8208;play framework enables tunable, multimodal oscillations with diverse materials and architectures. By integrating this approach into reconfigurable displayers, wide&#8208;field scanners, and efficient energy harvesters, we demonstrate its potential to bridge autonomous machines with various technologies, advancing the development of out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, intelligent soft robotics.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;sustained oscillations are fundamental to dynamic systems in nature, such as heartbeats, ocean waves, and firefly flashes. However, creating similar autonomous, out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium behaviors across diverse materials and structures in artificial settings remains challenging due to the lack of a universal, platform&#8208;independent control method. Here, we present an opto&#8208;magnetic feedback control strategy that achieves reliable self&#8208;excited oscillations through combined light, magnetic, and mechanical interactions based on a modular design approach. The dynamic, plug&#8208;and&#8208;play assembly of driving and deforming modules endows the platform with exceptional versatility in material type, structural setup, mechanical response, and functional use. Notably, this system can be tuned to produce continuous or intermittent self&#8208;oscillations, demonstrating its adaptability. We showcase the broad utility of the system by integrating optical modules for reconfigurable dynamic displays and wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view light scanning, together with a thermo&#8208;mechano&#8208;electrical transduction module for high&#8208;efficiency energy harvesting. The proposed approach establishes a universal feedback pathway linking autonomous soft machines with various technological platforms, enabling on&#8208;demand adaptation across different application scenarios.

Multifunctional All&#8208;Hydrogel Fibers
Hydrogels possess both mechanical and chemical similarity to neural tissues. Although diverse hydrogels have been synthesized for biomedical applications, integrating multiple hydrogels into compact multimaterial architectures remains challenging. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511634), Seongjun Park and co&#8208;workers identify a class of thermoplastic hydrogels and introduce the hydrogel thermal drawing process (HG&#8208;TDP), a fabrication platform that seamlessly integrates functional hydrogels into multimodal and three&#8208;dimensional neural probes. The resulting all&#8208;hydrogel fibers simultaneously allow precise neuromodulation at the fiber tip while maintaining anti&#8208;fibrotic tissue interfacing along their entire length. By bridging the materials gap between neural interfaces and biological tissues, HG&#8208;TDP establishes a foundation for the development of implantable neurotechnologies that naturally integrate with the nervous system.

Microbiota&#8208;Immune Modulation
Inspired by N&#252;wa &#8220;mending the sky,&#8221; this cover depicts an LPS&#8208;binding hydrogel repairing an oronasal&#8208;perforating wound, where the palate is &#8220;heaven.&#8221; Mountains evoke teeth; the sky's opening signifies a palatal fistula. Cloud&#8208;like rugae trace hard&#8208;palate anatomy, while bubbles and stars represent bacteria and inflammatory cues. By sequestering LPS, the hydrogel modulates TLR4&#8208;linked microbiota&#8211;immune signaling to promote regenerative healing. More details can be found in the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202514484) by Bing Shi, Chao Yang, Kam W. Leong, Hanyao Huang, and co&#8208;workers.

Chirality&#8208;Induced Skyrmion Crystals
Chirality emerges as a key driver of skyrmion lattice organization and functionality. In CrBr3, a weak in&#8208;plane magnetic field induces spontaneous chirality switching, reshaping skyrmions and triggering their crystallisation from a disordered liquid into an ordered hexatic lattice. This chirality&#8208;driven ordering highlights new opportunities for robust, low&#8208;energy information storage and reconfigurable chiral spintronic devices. More details can be found in the Research Article by John Fullerton, Yue Li, Elton J. G. Santos, Charudatta Phatak, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202513067).

Remorphable Metamaterials and Structures
Adaptive structures can morph their shapes on demand to accommodate ever&#8208;changing environments, enabling efficient packaging, transportation, and beyond. In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509940), Lei Wu Damiano Pasini, and co&#8208;workers present a new class of remorphable architectures that harness locally bistable metamaterials to unlock diverse shape&#8208;morphing pathways. By selectively flipping their bistable units, these architectures enable in situ control over snapping trajectories and access to multiple target shapes. Such versatility enables applications from soft robotics and deployable space systems to unconventional devices like metamaterial electric violins&#8208;showcasing broad, multi&#8208;target shape&#8208;morphing within a single design.

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Neuromorphic Devices and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors are emerging as promising platforms for neuromorphic devices that emulate neuronal and synaptic activities and can seamlessly integrate with biological systems. This review focuses on resultant organic artificial neurons, synapses, and integrated devices, with an emphasis on their ability to perform neuromorphic functions and diverse applications in neuromorphic computing and flexible biointerfaces.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering, an interdisciplinary field bridging bioelectronics and neuroscience, endeavors to address the bottleneck of the von Neumann architecture by constructing hardware&#8208;level artificial neural networks (ANNs) and replicate the complicated architecture and functionality of the human brain, heralding a new era of intelligent sensing, processing, and computing systems. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which operate via the bulk doping of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors, are emerging as promising platforms for neuromorphic devices that emulate neuronal and synaptic activities while seamlessly integrating with biological systems. OECTs offer several advantages, including compatibility with flexible and stretchable substrates, tunable ionic and electronic conductivity, multimodal sensing capability, and operation at low voltages. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vista of the rapidly advancing field of OECT&#8208;based neuromorphic devices, including organic electrochemical neurons, organic electrochemical synapses, and their integrated devices. Particular emphasis is placed on their ability to perform neuromorphic functions and diverse applications in neuromorphic computing and flexible biointerfaces. Conclusions, remaining challenges, and future prospects for the development of OECT&#8208;based neuromorphic devices are finally outlined.

&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic engineering, an interdisciplinary field bridging bioelectronics and neuroscience, endeavors to address the bottleneck of the von Neumann architecture by constructing hardware-level artificial neural networks (ANNs) and replicate the complicated architecture and functionality of the human brain, heralding a new era of intelligent sensing, processing, and computing systems. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which operate via the bulk doping of organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors, are emerging as promising platforms for neuromorphic devices that emulate neuronal and synaptic activities while seamlessly integrating with biological systems. OECTs offer several advantages, including compatibility with flexible and stretchable substrates, tunable ionic and electronic conductivity, multimodal sensing capability, and operation at low voltages. This review aims to provide a comprehensive and state-of-the-art vista of the rapidly advancing field of OECT-based neuromorphic devices, including organic electrochemical neurons, organic electrochemical synapses, and their integrated devices. Particular emphasis is placed on their ability to perform neuromorphic functions and diverse applications in neuromorphic computing and flexible biointerfaces. Conclusions, remaining challenges, and future prospects for the development of OECT-based neuromorphic devices are finally outlined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances in Collective Behaviors of Micro/Nanomotor Swarms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review describes the driving forces behind collective motion, explores the self&#8208;organization of micro/nano swarms across zero&#8208;dimensional (0D), one&#8208;dimensional (1D), two&#8208;dimensional (2D), and three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;spaces, and highlights their potential in drug delivery, environmental monitoring, and smart devices. It offers insights and perspectives to support future developments and new opportunities in swarm&#8208;based technologies.








ABSTRACT
Collective motion, exemplified by swarming insects, flocking birds, and bacterial colonies, emerges from the synchronized actions and velocity adjustments of individual units. Inspired by these natural phenomena, researchers have sought to replicate and harness collective behavior in swarms of self&#8208;propelled micro/nanomotors. This endeavor is of great importance for the development of multicomponent adaptive systems. Comprising numerous interacting elements, collective swarms exhibit emergent behaviors that capitalize on multi&#8208;motor cooperation, enabling highly efficient, flexible, and robust group performance. Understanding and engineering these behaviors are essential for translating them into practical applications. This review examines the driving forces underlying collective motion, outlines various modes of swarm formation across different dimensions, and highlights representative applications. By linking driving forces, system dimensionality, and functional implementation, it provides a comprehensive perspective on this field.

         <title>Sculpting the Future of Bone: The Evolution of Absorbable Materials in Orthopedics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the current status of polymeric, ceramic, and metallic absorbable materials in orthopedic applications, and highlights several innovative strategies designed to enhance mechanical performance, control degradation, and promote bioactivity. We also discuss the progress and translational potential of absorbable materials in treating various clinical bone disorders.








ABSTRACT
The repair of bone defects remains a major clinical challenge, as autologous grafts are constrained by donor limitations and bioinert implants often necessitate secondary surgeries. Absorbable materials, including polymers, ceramics, and metals, are rapidly transforming orthopedic care by offering temporary support and synchronized degradation to match tissue regeneration. This review highlights cutting&#8208;edge advances in composite scaffolds that enhance mechanical integrity, degradation kinetics, and osteoinductivity. We further explore innovative systems integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials (e.g., photothermal, piezoelectric), 4D printing smart materials, regenerative therapies, and bone organoids. Emerging clinical data are discussed in the context of diseases such as osteonecrosis, osteomyelitis, and osteoporosis. Looking forward, we outline transformative directions, including AI&#8208;driven scaffold design, gradient architectures, and immunomodulatory strategies to resolve the spatiotemporal mismatch between degradation and regeneration. This review offers a forward&#8208;looking framework for next&#8208;generation multifunctional, bioresponsive orthopedic implants.

         <title>Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Methanol on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts: Mechanistic Insights and Industrial Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a focused and integrated perspective on copper&#8208;based catalysts for the selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol. It elucidates active site dynamics, mechanistic pathways, and structure&#8211;activity relationships, while connecting fundamental insights with catalyst design, reactor engineering, and techno&#8208;economic considerations to guide the development of commercially viable, renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;driven methanol production technologies.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) offers a promising route to convert CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable energy. Among the diverse ECO2R products, the selective conversion of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) holds significant industrial importance as a fuel and chemical feedstock. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts for selective ECO2R to CH3OH. Key advancements in catalyst design and synthesis are discussed, followed by mechanistic insights obtained through computational modeling and advanced characterization techniques. Special focus is given to the structure&#8208;activity relationship that controls CH3OH selectivity, disclosing the importance of intermediate stabilization and electronic structure tuning. Further, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based materials and benchmarking their performances under various operating conditions, including the role of electrolyzer configurations, electrolytes, and ion&#8208;exchange membranes, is summarized. Moreover, we analyze challenges in upscaling, such as stability, selectivity under high current densities, and integration with renewable energy sources. Besides, the potential of tandem and hybrid systems to improve reaction pathways is also emphasized. Finally, techno&#8208;economic considerations are explored to evaluate the feasibility of large&#8208;scale CH3OH production. By combining fundamental understanding with practical implementation, this review provides strategic direction toward the rational design of Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the development of commercially viable ECO2R systems for sustainable CH3OH synthesis.

         <title>Colloidal Quantum Dot Liquid Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot liquid lasers combine solution&#8208;processable nanocrystals with fluidic gain media, offering efficient heat dissipation, enhanced photostability, and wide spectral tunability. This Review highlights recent progress in materials design, lasing mechanisms, and device architectures, and discusses key challenges and opportunities for future development. 








ABSTRACT
Thermal management of lasers fundamentally limits the upper limit of their output power as well as their operational stability. In this context, liquid&#8208;state lasers exhibit an unparalleled advantage in power scalability and stability, owing to their highly efficient heat dissipation facilitated by continuous fluid circulation. Additionally, the intrinsic compatibility of liquid lasers with microfluidic platforms also holds great promise for integration into energy&#8208;efficient, miniaturized photonic systems. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs), which are solution&#8208;processed semiconductor nanocrystals, have emerged as highly versatile optical gain materials. While research over the past decade has been predominantly centered on solid&#8208;state QD lasers made from densely packed QD films or composite matrices, there has been a recent surge of interest in exploring QDs in their native dispersion form as active gain media for liquid&#8208;state lasers. This review provides a systematic overview of recent advances in QD&#8208;based liquid lasers, detailing their operational principles, critical performance metrics, and highlighting their unique advantages. Moreover, we point out current technical bottlenecks and explore prospective strategies for overcoming these limitations to pave the way for practical&#160;QD&#8208;based liquid lasing technologies.

         <title>Biomimetic Mineralized Hydrogels for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to recapitulate the structural and compositional cues of native bone, have emerged as a leading candidate for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in their design, focusing on innovative homogeneous and heterogeneous mineralization mechanisms. Moreover, their therapeutic applications are examined, and the discussion concludes with prevailing challenges and future directions for clinical translation.








Abstract
Bone mineralization is a tightly regulated process involving the deposition of hydroxyapatite and other calcium salt crystals within the collagen&#8208;rich extracellular matrix of bone tissue, which confers hierarchical architecture and exceptional biomechanical properties to bone through this organized biocrystal arrangement. Inspired by this natural process, biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to mimic the chemical composition, structural organization, mechanical strength, and osteoinductive capabilities of bone tissue, have garnered considerable attention as promising candidates for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in the design and application of biomimetic mineralized hydrogels for bone regeneration. Following an overview of natural biomineralization principles, innovative strategies for constructing&#160;heterogeneous and homogeneous biomimetic mineralized hydrogels are first highlighted, emphasizing their structural and functional mimicry. Subsequently, their therapeutic applications are critically examined, including bone defect repair, osteochondral regeneration, osteoporotic bone repair, and other bone&#8208;related diseases (e.g., osteosarcoma, tendon&#8208;bone interface injury).

     alt="Biomimetic Mineralized Hydrogels for Bone Regeneration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to recapitulate the structural and compositional cues of native bone, have emerged as a leading candidate for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in their design, focusing on innovative homogeneous and heterogeneous mineralization mechanisms. Moreover, their therapeutic applications are examined, and the discussion concludes with prevailing challenges and future directions for clinical translation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone mineralization is a tightly regulated process involving the deposition of hydroxyapatite and other calcium salt crystals within the collagen-rich extracellular matrix of bone tissue, which confers hierarchical architecture and exceptional biomechanical properties to bone through this organized biocrystal arrangement. Inspired by this natural process, biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to mimic the chemical composition, structural organization, mechanical strength, and osteoinductive capabilities of bone tissue, have garnered considerable attention as promising candidates for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in the design and application of biomimetic mineralized hydrogels for bone regeneration. Following an overview of natural biomineralization principles, innovative strategies for constructing&#160;heterogeneous and homogeneous biomimetic mineralized hydrogels are first highlighted, emphasizing their structural and functional mimicry. Subsequently, their therapeutic applications are critically examined, including bone defect repair, osteochondral regeneration, osteoporotic bone repair, and other bone-related diseases (e.g., osteosarcoma, tendon-bone interface injury). Finally, persistent challenges are identified, and future research directions are proposed to advance these hydrogel systems toward clinical translation in bone tissue engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review highlights how self&#8208;decision bioelectronic systems integrate sensing, computation, and therapy into autonomous, closed&#8208;loop platforms that continuously monitor and treat diseases, marking a major step toward intelligent, self&#8208;regulating healthcare technologies.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;decision bioelectronic systems mark a transformative leap from conventional &#8216;sense&#8208;then&#8208;treat&#8217; paradigms toward autonomous, closed&#8208;loop therapeutics, with material innovation serving as the pivotal enabler. This review posits that material innovation is the pivotal enabler of this transition, seamlessly integrating high&#8208;performance sensing, intelligent computation, and adaptive intervention. We elucidate how recent advances in electrochemical, electrophysiological, optical, and mechanical sensors fabricated from soft conductors, responsive polymers, and nanocomposites yield critical data streams for reliable physiological monitoring. We further explore how decision&#8208;making architectures, ranging from threshold&#8208;based logic to neuromorphic computation, transform these data into real&#8208;time therapeutic commands. Diverse material platforms are positioned as the central drivers of functional outputs, enabling precise electrical stimulation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery, mechanical actuation, and optical modulation, as demonstrated in artificial pancreas systems, neurointerventions, and smart wound dressings. Finally, we discuss system&#8208;level integration strategies and confront the enduring challenges, including biointegration, sustainable power, and regulatory translation, that must be overcome for clinical adoption. By threading the narrative through the lens of material innovation, this review not only surveys the current landscape but also provides a unique materials&#8208; and engineering&#8208;oriented perspective, aiming to chart a roadmap for next&#8208;generation autonomous and personalized medicine.

         <title>Interface Matters: Boosting Efficient Pb&#8208;Sn Perovskite Solar Cells for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of interfaces critically govern charge carrier dynamics and chemical stability in photovoltaic devices, ultimately determining their power conversion efficiency and operational lifetime. This review summarizes fundamental insights and cutting&#8208;edge progress in regulating the grain, buried, and top interfaces of Pb&#9472;Sn perovskite films to develop efficient single&#8208;junction Pb&#9472;Sn PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








ABSTRACT
To overcome the theoretical efficiency limit of single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the development of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (APTSCs) has attracted significant interest due to their low cost, high efficiency, and compatibility with flexible substrates. Currently, the performance of APTSCs is primarily constrained by the inferior performance of narrow&#8208;bandgap lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#9472;Sn) perovskite sub&#8208;cells, stemming from poor interface quality caused by Sn2+ instability and an unbalanced crystallization process. Encouragingly, recent breakthroughs in rational interface engineering have enabled the construction of high&#8208;quality Pb&#9472;Sn perovskite films with optimized interfaces, boosting the efficiency of APTSCs beyond 30%. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent advances in interface engineering for realizing efficient Pb&#9472;Sn PSCs and APTSCs. First, we introduce the fundamental challenges and potential solutions associated with the different interfaces in Pb&#9472;Sn PSCs, including the grain boundaries, buried interface, and top interface. Subsequently, we carefully examine cutting&#8208;edge strategies and their underlying mechanisms for addressing these interface issues of Pb&#9472;Sn PSCs, and the corresponding performance of their APTSCs is also summarized. Finally, we offer a critical perspective on this exciting field. This review is intended to inspire new ideas for further performance improvements in Pb&#9472;Sn PSCs and APTSCs.

         <title>Personal Thermoregulation by Heat&#8208;Conducting Engineered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article covers personal thermal management textiles. It begins with mechanistic models for predicting thermal conductivity of composites, reviews advance in single&#8208;function (warming/cooling) and bifunctional (switchable) textile design, analyzes key scientific challenges for practical application, and concludes with an outlook on future developments and emerging applications of personal thermal management technology.








ABSTRACT
Personal thermal management (PTM) is a technique leveraging advanced textile design to control the heat exchange between the human body and the external environment, thereby regulating microenvironments surrounding individuals and ensuring optimal thermal comfort. Critical to the PTM is heat conductivity, which serves as the primary mode of thermal transfer in textiles. Various materials with engineered thermal conductivities have been developed and incorporated into textiles for modulating warming and cooling effects toward achieving the optimal thermal comfort. However, the performance of reported textiles remains far from being satisfactory to meet the needs of daily use, especially in terms of heat management, wearability, and operational stability. Here, we first introduce mechanistic models for predicting the textiles&#8217; thermal conductivity. Then, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the design and realization of both single&#8208;function textiles (warming or cooling) and bifunctional textiles (switchable warming and cooling) based on mechanical force and various stimuli&#8208;responsive materials. We also analyze the major scientific and technological challenges for materializing the potential of textiles into practical applications in the PTM. Finally, an outlook is made on the future developments of the heat&#8208;conducting textiles and on the emerging applications of PTM technology.

         <title>Dynamic, Reconfigurable, and Hierarchical Biosynthetic Composites via Collagen Self&#8208;Assembly within Highly Crowded Microgel Pastes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach to extracellular matrix&#8208;mimetic, hierarchical biomaterials is presented. Soft gels composed of overpacked hydrogel microparticle arrays present a biomolecularly crowded environment permissive to the self&#8208;assembly of collagen networks. The resultant hierarchical biomaterial displays a range of biomimetic structural and biophysical features that collectively create an environment supportive of cell viability and migration.








Abstract
The fabrication of a new class of biomimetic biomaterials is reported using nanostructured microgel pastes formed from &#8220;overpacked&#8221; assemblies of ultrasoft poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) microgels and their composites with collagen. Despite the solid&#8208;like nature of microgel pastes, collagen fibrillogenesis is robust and rapid, with a 3D collagen network forming throughout the paste volume. Structural organization within the composite is interrogated via a suite of microscopy methods, while rheological characterization provides insight into the static and dynamic mechanical properties of the materials. Long&#8208;range fibrillogenesis is enabled by local crowding, dynamics, and spatial reconfigurability of pastes at the colloidal length&#8208;scale, and by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation during fibril formation, features that mimic the dynamic reorganization of natural extracellular matrix. In vitro 3D cell culture studies illustrate that the paste is non&#8208;toxic, permeable to nutrients, and permissive to cell invasion, while collagen fibers present sites for cell attachment and spreading. Together, these results suggest the platform's potential in the development of tissue scaffolds that mimic crowded and dynamic biological tissues. These materials address the need for new approaches to biomaterials that offer dynamic, bio&#8208;integrative environments for tissue healing and regenerative medicine via synthetic and spatial control from the polymer to the macroscopic length scales.

         <title>Mesoscale Magnetostructural Phase Separation in Fe&#8208;deficient Fe5GeTe2</title>

Lorentz 4D&#8208;STEM reveals magnetostructural Fe&#8208;vacancy induced phase separation at different length scales in 2D ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2. The distribution and size of the Fe&#8208;deficiency phase strongly affects its magnetic anisotropy.








Abstract
2D Van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8208;xGeTe2 (F5GT) is promising for spintronic applications due to its high Curie temperature, layered structure, and ability to host complex magnetic textures. However, the origin of its sample&#8208;dependent magnetic anisotropy remains unclear, hindering control of its magnetic behavior. Here, spatially resolved cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is used to correlatively map magnetism, lattice structure, and chemistry across atomic&#8208;to&#8208;micron scales. This is revealed that only mesoscale, not nanoscale, inclusions of a Fe&#8208;deficient secondary phase significantly modify magnetic behavior, establishing a previously unrecognized critical length scale. This phase separation, induced by quenching, leads to in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, while slow cooling confines separation to a few nanometers and preserves out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy. These findings reconcile prior inconsistencies and establish a predictive framework for tuning magnetism in F5GT through thermal processing, with broader implications for controlling anisotropy in other 2D magnetic materials.

However, the origin of its sample-dependent magnetic anisotropy remains unclear, hindering control of its magnetic behavior. Here, spatially resolved cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is used to correlatively map magnetism, lattice structure, and chemistry across atomic-to-micron scales. This is revealed that only mesoscale, not nanoscale, inclusions of a Fe-deficient secondary phase significantly modify magnetic behavior, establishing a previously unrecognized critical length scale. This phase separation, induced by quenching, leads to in-plane magnetic anisotropy, while slow cooling confines separation to a few nanometers and preserves out-of-plane anisotropy. These findings reconcile prior inconsistencies and establish a predictive framework for tuning magnetism in F5GT through thermal processing, with broader implications for controlling anisotropy in other 2D magnetic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Moth&#8208;Wing&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a moth&#8208;wing&#8208;inspired heterogeneous metamaterial that achieves synergistic broadband sound absorption, mechanical energy dissipation, and thermal insulation within a lightweight architected framework. Combining bioinspired gradient design, genetic&#8208;algorithm optimization, and additive manufacturing, the bionic heterogeneous acoustic metamaterial demonstrates superior multifunctional integration and applicability in advanced noise&#8208;control systems such as protective helmets.








Abstract
To evade ultrasonic predation by bats, moths have evolved wing scale architectures capable of absorbing and scattering high&#8208;frequency acoustic signals. Drawing inspiration from this natural defense strategy, a bioinspired multifunctional metamaterial is presented that integrates broadband sound absorption, thermal insulation, and mechanical energy dissipation within a unified structural framework. Inspired by the graded pore architecture of moth scales, acoustic performance is first optimized via genetic algorithm&#8211;driven pore design and the structures using 3D printing. The resulting metamaterial exhibits broadband acoustic absorption with an average coefficient of 0.742 across the 1000&#8211;6000&#160;Hz frequency range. When implemented in helmet&#8208;based noise reduction systems, the proposed metamaterial outperforms conventional commercial foams in suppressing environmental noise. In addition, the metamaterial retains a negative Poisson's ratio under large deformation, which enhances its mechanical energy dissipation and impact resilience. Furthermore, the alternating architecture of polymer layers and internal air cavities reduces the effective thermal conductivity to 30.2 mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, ensuring excellent thermal insulation. This work demonstrates that leveraging biological architectures enables the simultaneous integration of acoustic, mechanical, and thermal functionalities in lightweight metamaterials, offering a new paradigm for multifunctional design.

         <title>Handed Magnon Propagation in Easy&#8208;Axis Antiferromagnetic &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coherent excitation and detection of handed magnons are achieved in the easy&#8208;axis antiferromagnet &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3. An external magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between left&#8208; and right&#8208;handed magnons without affecting their propagation velocity. The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and anisotropy modulate their amplitude and damping, enabling intrinsic control of handed magnons and paving the way for robust, high&#8208;frequency antiferromagnetic magnonic devices.








Abstract
Antiferromagnetic magnons with intrinsic handedness provide a unique degree of freedom enabling spin&#8208;selective control, as left&#8208;handed (LH) and right&#8208;handed (RH) magnons carry opposite spin angular momenta. While previous studies have mainly focused on antiferromagnetic resonance modes, the coherent transport of nondegenerate handed magnons has remained unexplored in antiferromagnets. In this work, the excitation and detection of LH and RH propagating magnons in the easy&#8208;axis antiferromagnet &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is demonstrated. Below the Morin transition temperature (TM), an external magnetic field along the easy axis lifts the degeneracy between two modes without altering their group velocities, establishing field&#8208;insensitive transport as a distinct characteristic of antiferromagnetic magnons. In addition, the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and magnetic anisotropy strongly modulate the frequency and group velocity, as well as the amplitude and damping of LH and RH magnons, particularly near TM. These results identify internal magnetic interactions as key factors controlling handed magnon propagation. The findings advance the fundamental understanding of handed magnon dynamics and open new pathways for spin&#8208;resolved, energy&#8208;efficient, and ultrafast magnonic devices.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Regulating Membranes with Surface&#8208;Enriched Charge Networks Enabling Stable Zinc&#8208;Manganese Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulating membrane is designed with a surface&#8208;concentrated positively&#8208;charged Zn2&#8314; crosslinked network for zinc&#8208;manganese flow batteries. The membrane effectively mitigates proton crossover and regulates zinc ion distribution to avoid dendrites, thus significantly improving areal capacity and prolonging the lifespan with a record accumulated capacity.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based flow batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage owing to their high energy density and eco&#8208;friendliness. When coupling with Mn2+/MnO2 posolyte, the zinc&#8208;manganese flow batteries promise an ultra&#8208;low electrolyte cost (0.0039 $ Ah&#8722;1). However, their practical application is limited by low areal capacity (&lt;20 mAh cm&#8722;2) and poor lifespan (&lt;100 cycles with accumulated capacity &lt; 2000 mAh cm&#8722;2), associated with proton crossover and zinc dendrite formation. To address the two bottlenecks, an ion&#8208;regulating membrane with surface&#8208;enriched positive charges of Zn2+ crosslinked networks is proposed. The enriched&#8208;charged networks amplify H&#8314; retention (60% elevated proton transport barrier to 0.104&#160;eV) via imposing charge&#8208;enhanced dehydration barriers and nitrogen&#8208;groups synergism, leveraging the higher ionic potential of protons to discriminate the conduction ions (K+). Simultaneously, the surface charges electrostatically guide the uniform distribution of near&#8208;electrode zinc ions for zinc&#8208;oriented growth without dendrites. The synergistic strategy achieves a near&#8208;neutral zinc&#8208;manganese flow system with a record accumulated capacity of 6510 mAh cm&#8722;2 (&gt;200 cycles) at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, high areal capacity of 100 mAh cm&#8722;2 (130.1 mWh cm&#8722;2) at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, representing one of the most stable zinc&#8208;manganese flow batteries reported. This study provides an effective membrane design strategy for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based flow batteries.

         <title>Smart Supramolecular Humidity Sensors Based on Crystalline Organic Cages for Noninvasive Freshness and Respiratory Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline N3O3 organic cage&#8211;based smart supramolecular sensing (SSS) platform enables ultrafast, reversible, and stable humidity detection through Grotthuss&#8208;type proton hopping, with demonstrated utility from fruit surface moisture assessment for food quality control to wireless respiratory monitoring via a smart facemask capable of detecting early signs of asthma attacks.








Abstract
Noninvasive monitoring is most powerful when physiologic and environmental signals can be captured without contact or sample destruction, using materials that respond rapidly, remain stable, and integrate easily into wearables.

&lt;p&gt;A crystalline N3O3 organic cage&#8211;based smart supramolecular sensing (SSS) platform enables ultrafast, reversible, and stable humidity detection through Grotthuss-type proton hopping, with demonstrated utility from fruit surface moisture assessment for food quality control to wireless respiratory monitoring via a smart facemask capable of detecting early signs of asthma attacks.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noninvasive monitoring is most powerful when physiologic and environmental signals can be captured without contact or sample destruction, using materials that respond rapidly, remain stable, and integrate easily into wearables. Despite its growing impact across health, safety, and quality assessment, there is still a clear gap in materials that simultaneously deliver high sensitivity, long-term stability, and device-level compatibility. Smart supramolecular sensing (SSS) platforms&#8212;built on dynamic, reversible intermolecular interactions&#8212;offer a compelling strategy for next-generation noninvasive monitoring technologies. Here, a crystalline N3O3 organic cage&#8211;based humidity-sensing SSS system is reported that exhibits ultrafast response, exceptional reversibility, and long-term operational stability.

         <title>N&#233;el Tensor Torque in Polycrystalline Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a N&#233;el tensor torque based on a rank&#8208;two symmetric tensor capturing spin correlations in a polycrystalline antiferromagnet. It shows the N&#233;el tensor can be shaped and reshaped through the spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) technique, enabling field&#8208;free SOT switching with a specific polarity of the adjacent ferromagnet. This discovery opens a new avenue toward reconfigurable spintronic memory utilizing polycrystalline antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets (AFMs) offer exceptional promise for next&#8208;generation spintronic devices due to their ultrafast dynamics and resilience to external perturbations. However, while single&#8208;crystalline AFMs have been capable of being electrically manipulated, controlling polycrystalline AFM spins remains a major challenge due to their aperiodic nature. In this work, a N&#233;el tensor is introduced as a rank&#8208;two symmetric tensor that statistically captures the spin correlations in polycrystalline AFMs, a fundamental departure from the conventional N&#233;el vector approach. Using machine learning techniques, hidden statistical patterns in AFM spin structures are extracted, and establish the N&#233;el tensor torque, an emergent symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanism at the FM/AFM interface. This torque enables field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) switching in heavy&#8208;metal/FM/AFM trilayers. Furthermore, it is experimentally demonstrated that the N&#233;el tensor can be trained and memorized, allowing the system to retain its switching polarity&#8211;an unprecedented feature in AFM spintronics. This work unveils previously hidden statistical correlations in polycrystalline AFMs, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical spintronic applications. The findings lay the foundation for non&#8208;volatile, reconfigurable spintronic memory and neuromorphic computing, establishing the N&#233;el tensor as a new degree of freedom for AFM&#8208;based SOT switching.

         <title>Organic Liquid Crystals on Lewis&#8208;Acid Monopolar Polymer for Room&#8208;to&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Phototransistors</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates high&#8208;performance organic phototransistors that operate from 300 to 80&#160;K, enabling a remarkable responsivity of 417 &#177; 180&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and an outstanding photosensitivity above 104 even at 80&#160;K. This superior photoelectrical performance stems from enhanced vertical exciton diffusion through the SmE liquid crystal, combined with effective exciton dissociation and stable electron trapping at the polymer interface. 








Abstract
Organic phototransistors have garnered considerable attention for their potential in diverse optoelectronic applications. However, their inferior photoresponse or even out of operation at low temperatures severely limits their applications in extreme environments. In this work, high&#8208;performance organic phototransistors that operate from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions are demonstrated, utilizing smectic E (SmE) phase liquid crystals on a Lewis&#8208;acid monopolar polymer. These devices achieve a remarkable average responsivity of 417 &#177; 180&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and an outstanding photosensitivity above 104 even at 80&#160;K. This superior photoelectrical performance stems from the efficient vertical exciton diffusion through the SmE liquid crystal, combined with effective exciton dissociation and stable electron trapping at the polymer interface across the operating temperature range. Furthermore, the devices exhibit reliable photoinduced memory behavior, featuring stable storage&#8208;erase cycles and long retention time across a wide temperature range, highlighting their potential for optical memory applications. The results demonstrate that liquid crystals are promising candidates for room&#8208;to&#8208;low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;performance phototransistors, paving the way for advanced optoelectronic applications in harsh environments.

         <title>Reprogramming mRNA Delivery Tropism via Nitrogen&#8208;To&#8208;Sulfur Substitution in Ionizable Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonium lipid S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 is created by replacing the nitrogen in the head of ALC&#8208;0315 with sulfur. This seemingly slight but crucial modification provides S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 with a distinct ability to achieve lung targeting, while the introduction of S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 into LNPs containing ALC&#8208;0315 is capable of selectively delivering mRNA to dendritic cells in the spleen, thereby achieving a robust anti&#8208;tumor effect.








Abstract
Ionizable lipids serve as critical determinants for mRNA therapeutics. While clinically approved lipids like ALC&#8208;0315 demonstrate robust hepatic tropism, their inherent liver&#8208;targeting bias substantially limits therapeutic applications requiring extrahepatic delivery. Furthermore, the complex safety validation requirements for novel lipid architectures present significant barriers to clinical translation. Hence, a simple nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur (N&#8208;to&#8208;S) switching strategy is proposed in the head group of marketed vectors to modulate the tissue distribution of LNP&#8208;mRNA. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies with ALC&#8208;0315&#8208;derived S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 reveal that this atomic&#8208;level modification fundamentally redirected delivery tropism from hepatic to pulmonary tissues. Notably, formulation optimization demonstrates that combining S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 with its parent lipid at a 1:2 molar ratio generated LNPs with spleen targeting. Consequently, this method promotes the generation of antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and has produced significant anti&#8208;tumor effects in two tumor models while maintaining safety. This research underscores the N&#8208;to&#8208;S lipid modification as a promising platform for tailoring organ targeting and accelerating clinical translation.

         <title>Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte with Tailored Lithium Compatibility for High Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative cation&#8211;anion cosubstitution strategy is developed to address the interfacial challenges between garnet electrolytes and lithium metal. This approach effectively improves interfacial contact and suppresses side reactions, significantly enhancing the interfacial compatibility. The breakthrough provides crucial support for accelerating the deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, advancing their practical application.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) demonstrates appealing ionic conductivity for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applications. However, the interfacial compatibility between LLZO and the lithium electrode is yet to be addressed for the deployment of practical batteries at scale. Herein, tailored cubic&#8208;phase garnet&#8208;type Li7La3Zr2&#8208;xScxO12&#8208;xFx (LLZSOF&#8208;x, x = 0&#8211;0.20) SSEs are designed, which features high lithium content and superior compatibility with the lithium metal electrode. The strong binding of fluorine dopant with octahedral lithium ions significantly inhibits Li&#8314;/H&#8314; exchange, thus achieving intimate interfacial contact between composition&#8208;optimized Li7La3Zr1.85Sc0.15O11.85F0.15 (LLZSOF&#8208;0.15) and lithium electrode. Meanwhile, scandium substitution increases lithium content to 7.0, leading to improved reduction stability toward lithium metal. The LLZSOF&#8208;0.15 based symmetric cell yields high critical current density of 1.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which meets the practical requirements for solid&#8208;state batteries. And LLZSOF&#8208;0.15 based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries show excellent cyclability, with high&#8208;capacity retention of 83.2% over 240 cycles for LiFePO4 and 84.1% over 140 cycles for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM) (0.5&#8201;C). Li/LLZSOF&#8208;0.15/NCM pouch cells maintain over 99.5% Coulombic efficiency and 94.9% capacity retention after 120 cycles at 0.5 C.

&lt;p&gt;An innovative cation&#8211;anion cosubstitution strategy is developed to address the interfacial challenges between garnet electrolytes and lithium metal. This approach effectively improves interfacial contact and suppresses side reactions, significantly enhancing the interfacial compatibility. The breakthrough provides crucial support for accelerating the deployment of high-energy-density all-solid-state batteries, advancing their practical application.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garnet-type Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZO) solid-state electrolyte (SSE) demonstrates appealing ionic conductivity for all-solid-state battery applications. However, the interfacial compatibility between LLZO and the lithium electrode is yet to be addressed for the deployment of practical batteries at scale. Herein, tailored cubic-phase garnet-type Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;-x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;-x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;F&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (LLZSOF&lt;i&gt;-x&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0&#8211;0.20) SSEs are designed, which features high lithium content and superior compatibility with the lithium metal electrode. The strong binding of fluorine dopant with octahedral lithium ions significantly inhibits Li&#8314;/H&#8314; exchange, thus achieving intimate interfacial contact between composition-optimized Li&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.85&lt;/sub&gt;Sc&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;11.85&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZSOF-0.15) and lithium electrode. Meanwhile, scandium substitution increases lithium content to 7.0, leading to improved reduction stability toward lithium metal. The LLZSOF-0.15 based symmetric cell yields high critical current density of 1.9&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which meets the practical requirements for solid-state batteries. And LLZSOF-0.15 based all-solid-state lithium metal batteries show excellent cyclability, with high-capacity retention of 83.2% over 240 cycles for LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and 84.1% over 140 cycles for LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM) (0.5&#8201;C). Li/LLZSOF-0.15/NCM pouch cells maintain over 99.5% Coulombic efficiency and 94.9% capacity retention after 120 cycles at 0.5 C. This study establishes a material design approach for developing garnet SSEs with superior interfacial compatibility, promoting the deployment of advanced all-solid-state batteries at scale.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rotational Multimaterial 3D Printing of Soft Robotic Matter With Embedded Asymmetrical Pneumatics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft elastomers with embedded, asymmetric channels are created by rotational multimaterial 3D printing. Using a connected Fermat spiral pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths for fabricating complex designs, such as hand&#8208;inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build programmable soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.








ABSTRACT
The rapid design and fabrication of soft robotic matter is of growing interest for shape morphing, actuation, and wearable devices. Here, we report a facile fabrication method for creating soft robotic materials with embedded pneumatics that exhibit programmable shape morphing behavior. Using rotational multimaterial 3D printing, asymmetrical core&#8211;shell filaments composed of elastomeric shells and fugitive channels are patterned in 1D, 2D, and 2.5D motifs. By precisely controlling the nozzle design, rotation rate, extrusion rate, and print path, one can control the local orientation, shape, and cross&#8208;sectional area of the patterned fugitive channel along each printed filament. Once the elastomeric matrix is cured, the fugitive ink is removed, leaving behind embedded channels that facilitate pneumatic actuation. Using a connected Fermat spiral pathing approach, one can automatically generate desired print paths required for more complex soft robots, such as hand&#8208;inspired grippers. Our integrated design and printing approach enables one to rapidly build soft robotic matter that exhibits myriad shape morphing transitions on demand.

         <title>An Injectable and Modular NO&#8208;Adaptive Delivery System for Modulating Regenerative Microenvironment in Long&#8208;Segment Nerve Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nerve conduit integrating ROS&#8208;responsive NO&#8208;releasing nanoparticles and microgel&#8208;based hydrogels was developed for long&#8208;segment nerve repair. Adaptive NO release modulates inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial function, while interconnected macroporous microgels support cell infiltration and axonal growth. Magnetically induced electrical stimulation further enhances neurotrophic factor secretion and directional nerve regeneration.








Abstract
Repairing long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injuries remains a significant clinical challenge, hindered by oxidative stress, inflammation, insufficient revascularization, and limited axonal regeneration speeds. This study addresses these barriers by reconstructing the nerve regeneration microenvironment, enhancing cell migration, and accelerating axonal growth. An integrated regenerative microenvironment combining chemical signals, micro/nano structures, and electrical stimulation is developed. Specifically, nitric oxide (NO), a versatile signaling molecule, is dynamically released using sustained and responsive&#8208;release strategies to regulate oxidative stress and inflammation effectively. Furthermore, a gelatin&#8211;lipoic acid&#8211;seleno&#8208;lipoic acid (Gel&#8208;LA&#8208;SA) microgel&#8208;based hydrogel is designed, forming interconnected macroporous scaffolds that significantly enhance cell infiltration and growth compared to traditional hydrogels. Additionally, a non&#8208;invasive electroactive conduit is constructed to provide external electrical stimulation, promoting nerve cell migration and nerve growth factor secretion. Together, these elements guide axonal regeneration, support rapid revascularization, and enhance nutrient supply. By integrating NO signaling, advanced hydrogel scaffolds, and electrical stimulation, this multifunctional conduit effectively addresses the critical barriers to regenerating nerves across extensive defect sites, offering a promising approach for repairing long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injuries and providing insights into broader applications for neurological disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Resonant Interlayer Coupling in NbSe2&#8208;Graphite Epitaxial Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory derived calculations, this work reveals strong interlayer coupling and moir&#233; replicas of the graphite &#960; states in molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy grown van der Waals heterostructures of monolayer&#8208;NbSe2/graphite, with implications for its collective phases that form.








Abstract
Moir&#233; heterostructures, created by stacking 2D materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, clear spectroscopic signatures of moir&#233; lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe2 grown on graphite substrates are observed.&#160;Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir&#233; replicas of the graphite &#960; states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe2 Fermi surface at the k$k$&#8208;space locations where NbSe2's charge&#8208;density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML&#8208;NbSe2/graphene as compared to a more than fourfold enhancement for NbSe2 on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir&#233; engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D&#160;materials.

         <title>Beyond Rigid Frameworks: A Dynamic 2D Supramolecular Organic Network of Luminescent Radicals in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble luminescent radical self&#8208;assembles with cucurbit[8]uril into a 2D honeycomb supramolecular organic framework (SOF) in water. This framework exhibits enhanced optical and magnetic properties and, notably, features reversible disassembly and reassembly upon thermal stimuli, providing a dynamic platform for constructing adaptive radical&#8208;based materials.








ABSTRACT
We report the design and synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble luminescent radical, TTM&#8208;3IMB, which spontaneously assembles with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) into a well&#8208;defined 2D honeycomb supramolecular organic framework (SOF) in aqueous solution. Unlike conventional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) or metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the resulting SOF exhibits dynamic and reversible assembly behavior. Heating to 90&#176;C triggers disassembly of the framework, while subsequent cooling to room temperature induces reassembly, as confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence and EPR spectra. This reversible process enables modulation of spin&#8211;spin interactions and excited&#8208;state dynamics within the framework. The SOF architecture not only enhances the photostability of TTM&#8208;3IMB by four times but also increases its photoluminescence quantum efficiency from 2.0% to 5.0%. Multiscale characterization, including EPR, SEM, SAXS, and SQUID measurements, reveals an ordered honeycomb morphology and weak antiferromagnetic coupling among radical units. This work introduces a dynamic supramolecular strategy for constructing open&#8208;shell 2D materials in water, offering new opportunities for tunable optoelectronic, magnetic, and bioresponsive applications.

This work introduces a dynamic supramolecular strategy for constructing open-shell 2D materials in water, offering new opportunities for tunable optoelectronic, magnetic, and bioresponsive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Reversible Zero&#8208;Field Diode Effect in van der Waals Ferromagnetic Josephson Junction for Logic Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarity&#8208;reversible zero&#8208;field Josephson diode effect (JDE) with a rectification efficiency of up to 34.1% is achieved in a vertically stacked van der Waals NbSe2/Fe3GeTe2/NbSe2 junction, and a XOR logic gate operation is implemented by using this reconfigurable JDE. This work establishes a new route toward realizing efficient, polarity&#8208;reversible, zero&#8208;field JDE and underscores their potential for 2D non&#8208;dissipative superconducting electronics.








Abstract
With unprecedented energy efficiency and quantum&#8208;ready properties, superconducting electronics drive breakthroughs in quantum processors, ultra&#8208;precise sensors, and beyond&#8208;Moore's&#8208;law computing architectures. While nonreciprocal circuit elements such as superconducting diodes are essential for these systems, the realization of practical devices with robust performance remains a major challenge. In particular, polarity&#8208;tunable superconducting diodes that operate efficiently under zero magnetic field are highly desired for practical applications. Here, a polarity&#8208;reversible zero&#8208;field Josephson diode effect (JDE) is demonstrated with highly sustained performance in a vertically stacked 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic Josephson junction composed of the Ising superconductor NbSe2 and the itinerant ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) layers. The diode asymmetry and rectification polarity are primarily tunable via the magnetic state and thickness of the FGT layer. By optimizing the thickness of the FGT layer, a polarity&#8208;reversible JDE is achieved with a rectification efficiency of up to 34.1%. Furthermore, an exclusive OR (XOR) logic gate operation is successfully implemented using this reconfigurable JDE. The work establishes a new route toward realizing efficient, polarity&#8208;reversible, zero&#8208;field superconducting diodes and underscores their potential for 2D non&#8208;dissipative superconducting electronics.

         <title>LPS&#8208;Binding Hydrogel for TLR4&#8208;Mediated Microbiota&#8208;Immune Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic LPS&#8208;binding hydrogel integrates polymyxin B (PMB)&#8208;mediated Gram&#8208;negative bacterial membrane disruption and LPS release with polyethyleneimine (PEI)&#8208;driven LPS scavenging to block LPS&#8208;TLR4 signaling, rebalance the microbiota&#8208;immune microenvironment, and promote coordinated neutrophil&#8208;macrophage&#8208;epithelial/fibroblast interactions, achieving regenerative healing of oronasal&#8208;perforating wounds&#8212;complex and infection&#8208;prone complications associated with cleft palate repair.








Abstract
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a conserved component of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, is a potent immune activator that disrupts tissue repair when released during microbial dysbiosis. LPS&#8208;scavenging strategies are often limited by the poor accessibility of lipid A, the bioactive core of LPS, which is shielded by variable oligosaccharide structures and embedded in bacterial membranes. To address this, a synergistic LPS&#8208;binding hydrogel (OCMC&#8208;PMBP) is developed, combining polymyxin B (PMB) for lipid A&#8208;targeted bacterial lysis and polyethyleneimine (PEI) for electrostatic LPS capture. This system is applied to oronasal&#8208;perforating wounds, a complex and infection&#8208;prone condition associated with cleft palate repair. Clinical microbiome analysis and murine models reveal that LPS&#8208;TLR4 signaling contributes to immune dysregulation and impaired healing. OCMC&#8208;PMBP treatment reduces LPS levels, restores microbiota balance, suppresses inflammation, and accelerates epithelial regeneration and collagen remodeling. Integrated 16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and single&#8208;cell transcriptomics show that the hydrogel reprograms immune cell phenotypes and modulates macrophage interactions with neutrophils, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts across healing phases. This study introduces a biomaterials design combining antimicrobial and immunomodulatory functions to resolve dysbiosis&#8208;induced inflammation and enhance regenerative healing in complex mucosal wounds.

         <title>Small Molecule&#8208;Driven Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Rapid, Ultrasensitive and Amplification&#8208;Free Detection of RNA Biomarkers</title>

An organic electrochemical transistor biosensor based on small molecule recognition and electrochemical signal transduction achieves ultrasensitive, amplification&#8208;free, and rapid three&#8208;minute detection of RNA.








Abstract
RNA biomarkers are vital for diagnosing infections, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. RT&#8208;qPCR is sensitive but complex and equipment&#8208;intensive, limiting point&#8208;of&#8208;care use. Herein, for the first time, an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) biosensor is reported utilizing small molecules as recognition elements for rapid, ultrasensitive and amplification&#8208;free detection of RNA. The biosensor leverages &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; to precisely immobilize screened and chemically edited small molecules to the OECT gate, enabling efficient target RNA binding. To further enhance sensitivity and reduce detection time, a rapid sample incubation module utilizing alternating current (AC) electrokinetic acceleration without the influence of electric currents and thermal effects strategy is employed to accelerate biomolecule transport and increase binding kinetics. This approach is validated using a model system incorporating C5, a chemically optimized small&#8208;molecule ligand that selectively binds SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 RNA. The resulting biosensor achieves real&#8208;time, amplification&#8208;free RNA detection within three minutes, and the results are transmitted to electronic devices via Bluetooth. Notably, it shows impressive sensitivity (0.3 aM) and excellent long&#8208;term stability, retaining functional sensitivity for five months under ambient storage. This work establishes a new paradigm for RNA biosensing, demonstrating the power of integrating small&#8208;molecule recognition, electrochemical transduction and AC field enhancement for next&#8208;generation rapid diagnostics.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Driven Non&#8208;Volatile Spin and Valley Control in a Van Der Waals Antiferromagnetic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates non&#8208;volatile spin and valley control in a van der Waals heterostructure of monolayer MoSe2 and bulk antiferromagnetic CrPS4, via interfacial spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer. Persistent chiral photoluminescence and hysteresis are achieved at a switching field 17 times lower than the bulk spin&#8208;flip field of CrPS4, enabling low&#8208;energy, magnetically tunable quantum devices.








ABSTRACT
The integration of non&#8208;volatile spin and valley control in 2D quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge for spintronic and valleytronic functionalities. Here, we demonstrate persistent spin and valley polarizations in a van der Waals heterostructure comprising bulk antiferromagnetic CrPS4 and monolayer MoSe2, achieved via interfacial magnetic proximity effects. The 1L&#8208;MoSe2/bulk&#8208;CrPS4 heterostructure exhibits non&#8208;volatile hysteresis in chiral photoluminescence (PL), directly linked to the antiferromagnetic ordering of bulk&#8208;CrPS4. This helicity of PL persists at zero field, enabled by the spin&#8208;polarized charge transfer from the K valley in the MoSe2 monolayer to the conduction band of CrPS4, breaking the valley degeneracy without external stimuli. Remarkably, the PL helicity switches surprisingly at a magnetic field of &#8764; 0.5 T, a 17&#8208;fold smaller than the spin&#8208;flip field of &#8764;8.5 T in bulk CrPS4. Our work establishes bulk antiferromagnet&#8208;based heterostructure as a robust platform for low&#8208;energy, magnetically tunable quantum devices, bridging the gap between the transient valleytronic phenomena and practical non&#8208;volatile applications.

         <title>Floating Epitaxy and Stitching Growth of Bilayer Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals on Polymer Dielectric Toward High&#8208;Performance and Ultra&#8208;Flexible Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating epitaxy and stitching growth method enables large&#8208;area growth of bilayer organic semiconductor single crystals on polymer dielectric. Surface&#8208;tension&#8208;controlled nucleation at the saturated solution&#8208;air interface reduces nucleation density and mitigates dielectric interference. The epitaxial&#160;crystals gradually stitch together, facilitating large&#8208;area crystals formation. Flexible organic filed&#8208;effect transistors based on these crystals&#160;retain the high performance even at ultralow bending radii.









Abstract
Bilayer organic semiconductor single crystals (OSSCs) have emerged as a highly promising material platform for the development of flexible organic electronic devices, owing to their exceptional mechanical flexibility and superior charge transport properties. However, in situ growth of bilayer OSSCs on polymer dielectric is greatly hindered by dielectric surface defects and strong molecular interaction between dielectric and organic semiconductor. Here, a floating epitaxy and stitching growth strategy is developed for large&#8208;area growth of bilayer OSSCs on polymer dielectric. By exploiting surface&#8208;tension&#8208;controlled nucleation behaviors of organic molecules, the preferential formation of organic seed crystals is achieved at saturated solution&#8208;air interface, thereby eliminating the adverse effects of polymer dielectric on nucleation and growth of OSSCs. Furthermore, the unique stitching growth mode of the crystals during epitaxial process ensures large&#8208;area bilayer OSSCs formation. Using this approach, we successfully fabricate sub&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized bilayer 2,9&#8208;didecyldinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene crystals on polymer dielectric. Notably, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on the crystals retain a high carrier mobility up to 15.1 cm2/Vs even after undergoing 3000 bending cycles at an ultra&#8208;small bending radius of 40 &#181;m, outperforming most existing flexible OFETs. This work opens a new avenue for large&#8208;area growth of bilayer OSSCs on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance, ultra&#8208;flexible transistors.

         <title>Nanoscale Confined Tribo&#8208;Ion&#8208;Photonics for Ultrahigh&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a nanoscale confined tribo&#8208;ion&#8208;photonic device has been proposed, which achieves ultrahigh spatial resolution through nanoscale&#8208;triboelectrification&#8208;tuned ion injection. The conductivity and photoluminescence intensity of the semiconductor can be modulated. The device exhibits excellent reversibility and a record&#8208;breaking spatial resolution of 42333 pixels per inch. On the basis, patterns with fine structure are successfully written and could be instantaneously read out.








Abstract
Interactive sensing displays with ultrahigh resolution are critically important for next&#8208;generation human&#8208;machine interfaces and near&#8208;eye display technologies, yet their development has been hindered by fabrication and material limitations. Here, a nanoscale confined tribo&#8208;ion&#8208;photonic device has been proposed, consisting of a counterion&#8208;electromigration&#8208;confined ion&#8208;gel, a poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (PBTTT) active layer, and an electrode, which achieves ultrahigh spatial resolution through nanoscale&#8208;triboelectrification&#8208;tuned ion injection. The electrical conductivity and photoluminescence intensity of the PBTTT layer can be precisely modulated by scan force, scan rate, scan cycles, and applied bias of the atomic microscopy tip. The device exhibits excellent reversibility and a record&#8208;breaking spatial resolution of 42333 pixels per inch. On the basis, patterns with fine structure are successfully written and stored in the device and can be instantaneously read out due to the electrochromic phenomenon even under ambient lighting conditions. This work established a novel approach to ultrahigh&#8208;resolution imaging by combining triboelectricity with organic semiconductor devices, opening new possibilities for applications in visualized tactile imaging, polymer&#8208;based nano&#8208;optoelectronics, and nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems.

         <title>Improving Ionic Conformality Across Polymer Electrolyte|Electrode Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer electrolytes typically form physically intimate electrode interfaces but often fail to maintain continuous ionic pathways, critically limiting battery performance. Through strategic compositional design, this study introduces a molecular ionic composite electrolyte that effectively reduces interfacial ionic depletion, ensuring consistent ion transport. Enhanced ionic conformality is directly visualized, improving cycling stability in solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
Maintaining uniform ionic transport at electrode|electrolyte interfaces, i.e., ionic conformality, remains challenging in polymer electrolyte (PE)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries. Morphological conformality does not necessarily imply ionic conformality. In PEs, which typically consist of a mechanically supporting component and distinct ionically conductive components, the rearrangement or depletion of mobile ion&#8208;conductive domains at interfaces can disrupt ionic transport pathways. Such localized ionic depletion contributes to interfacial instability and capacity degradation in high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, an electrolyte design approach aimed at minimizing interfacial heterogeneities is demonstrated through compositional adjustments, characterized by spatially resolved structural and chemical X&#8208;ray techniques and NMR diffusometry to elucidate ion transport dynamics. This approach improves ionic conformality at electrode interfaces, enhancing cycling stability in Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC811) coin and pouch cells cycled at high voltages. These results contribute to understanding interfacial behaviors in multiphase PEs and inform strategies for improving stability across solid&#8208;state battery interfaces.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Thermal Transport Modulation with Photoactive Nanofluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspension of photoactive titanium dioxide particles in a redox shuttle solution forms a light&#8208;responsive active fluid. Photochemical reactions induce convection in this fluid, enhancing thermal transport by over 100% as shown by experiments and simulations. This innovative fluid allows for precise local temperature control, promoting advancements in thermal management for miniaturized thermal devices.








Abstract
Efficient thermal management is at the core of energy generation and is crucial for modern high&#8208;performance electronics. Nanofluids, consisting of metal or inorganic nanoparticles suspended in a base fluid, can significantly enhance thermal transport performance, which is extensively studied for decades. On the other hand, with the growing need for thermal management, it will be desirable to access novel materials with in situ tunable thermal conductivity, allowing programmable delivery of thermal energy on demand. Here, a new type of thermal management material is demonstrated, a photoactive nanofluid, consisting of self&#8208;propelling active colloids suspended in a base fluid, where the overall thermal conductivity can be finely controlled through a light&#8208;driven chemical reaction. In particular, it is demonstrated that the active nanofluid, formulated with light&#8208;propelled colloids, can induce strong local convection, which not only prevents particle sedimentation but also enhances the overall heat transfer by over 100%, thereby allowing for on&#8208;demand thermal transport modulation with localized illumination.

         <title>Antagonistic Iron Competition Induced by Iron Chelators Heightens Cuproptosis in Both Tumors and Intratumoral Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ancient fable &#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;, this study develops a nano&#8208;chelator copper&#8208;deferiprone (Cu&#8208;DFP) that not only depletes iron ions in the tumor microenvironment to turn tumor cells against bacteria, but also releases Cu2+ to induce cuproptosis in both, thereby achieving dual suppression of tumors and their resident bacteria.








Abstract
Both tumors and intratumoral bacteria exhibit iron addiction, a shared metabolic dependency that drives their proliferation. Here, inspired by the ancient Chinese fable&#160;&#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;, a nano&#8208;chelator,&#160;copper&#8208;deferiprone (Cu&#8208;DFP), is designed and synthesized to deplete iron ions by metal chelation therapy in the tumor microenvironment, thereby&#160;&#8220;sowing discord&#8221;&#160;between tumors and intratumoral bacteria and subsequently inducing&#160;cuproptosis&#160;in both. Specifically, capitalizing on the high iron stores in both tumor cells and intratumoral bacteria, coupled with the superior iron&#8208;chelating capability of DFP, Cu&#8208;DFP effectively hijacks iron ions from these cellular reservoirs while concurrently liberating substantial amounts of copper ions (Cu2+). Iron depletion not only&#160;exacerbates the antagonistic rivalry&#160;between tumors and bacteria but also&#160;disrupts their defense mechanisms&#160;against external stressors. Moreover, the released Cu2+ leads to&#160;excessive intracellular copper accumulation, triggering&#160;cuproptosis&#160;in both. The dying tumor cells and bacteria then release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), respectively, promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and activating&#160;antitumor immune responses. By harnessing the iron&#8208;mediated metabolic competition to potentiate cuproptosis, this therapeutic strategy presents an innovative method for addressing intratumoral microbiota in oncology.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the ancient fable &lt;i&gt;&#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;&lt;/i&gt;, this study develops a nano-chelator copper-deferiprone (Cu-DFP) that not only depletes iron ions in the tumor microenvironment to turn tumor cells against bacteria, but also releases Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to induce cuproptosis in both, thereby achieving dual suppression of tumors and their resident bacteria.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Press&#8208;to&#8208;Seal Hydrogel Patches with Spatiotemporally Controllable Blood Repulsion for Acute Hemostasis and Enhanced Healing of Deep Incisive Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pressing the patches onto deep incisive wounds could release encapsulated SO from microgels, generating controllable blood repulsions for tight hydrogel&#8208;tissue anchoring. Concurrently, multivalent physical interactions between hydrogel and tissue induce the expected adhesive and sealing performance for acute hemostasis and enhanced healing of deep incisive wounds.








Abstract
Deep incisive wounds hemostasis and healing remain a significant challenge. Silicone oil (SO)&#8208;mediated blood repulsion enables bioadhesion to seal; however, achieving stable SO encapsulation, its controllable release, and then strong bioadhesion poses significant challenges. Herein, press&#8208;actuated silicone oil micro&#8208;reservoirs are engineered and assemble into adhesive hydrogel matrix, yielding press&#8208;to&#8208;seal hydrogel patches with user&#8208;initiated and press&#8208;triggered SO release, and area&#8208;controlled blood repulsion, and strong bioadhesion. Pressing the patch onto wet tissues to release SO, generating interfacial dehydration for tight hydrogel&#8208;tissue anchoring. Concurrently, functional groups between the hydrogel and tissue form multivalent physical interactions to achieve the expected adhesive and sealing performance. In animal deep incisive wounds, the press&#8208;to&#8208;seal hydrogel patches exhibit better hemostatic and accelerated wound healing performance than that of commercial adhesives. Tandem mass tags&#8208;labeled quantitative proteomics revealed that the press&#8208;to&#8208;seal hydrogel exerts targeted regulation on hemostatic, inflammatory, and tissue repair&#8208;associated proteins, critically modulating their expression during wound healing. This work provides a novel idea for spatiotemporal control of SO release, blood repulsion, and adhesion performance of the adhesive materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ammonia Production from Al&#8208;Nitrate Battery via Anodic Al&amp;NO3&#8722; Spontaneous Reaction Driven Cathodic Nitrate Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Al&#8208;NO3&#8722; catalytic battery, driven by Al and NO3&#8722; spontaneous reaction at anode, is designed to realize power production, and achieve NH3 production at both cathode and anode with &gt; 100% apparent faraday efficiency. The substantially enhanced production rate and Faraday efficiency are due to the CuNi alloy film with tandem catalytic sites after introducing Ni into Cu.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NIRR) offers a sustainable alternative for ammonia (NH3) synthesis, addressing the limitations of the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8208;Bosch process. This study introduces a novel aluminum&#8208;nitrate (Al&#8208;NO3&#8722;) battery system that integrates anodic Al and NO3&#8722; (Al&amp;NO3&#8722;) spontaneous reactions with cathodic NO3&#8722; reduction, enabling simultaneous NH3 production and electricity generation. The CuNi alloy films, synthesized via pulse laser confined bombardment (PLCB) technology, serve as efficient NIRR cathodes with tandem catalytic sites, delivering an NH3 production rate of &#8776;58.04 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 99.40% at &#8722;1.3 V vs. Hg/HgO. The Al&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery system, incorporating NO3&#8722; in both anodic and cathodic electrolytes, suppresses hydrogen evolution at the anode, and achieves an apparent FE exceeding 100% due to NO3&#8722; consumption for NH3 production through both cathodic NIRR and the spontaneous anodic Al&amp;NO3&#8722; reaction. Extended stability studies indicated continuous operation exceeding 50 h, with peak apparent FE reaching &#8776;183.60%. This system demonstrates a high NH3 yield of over 10.0 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 40 mA cm&#8722;2. The findings highlight the potential of Al&amp;NO3&#8722; spontaneous reactions to drive cathodic NO3&#8722; reduction, offering a sustainable pathway for NH3 synthesis from NO3&#8722;&#8208;rich wastewater while generating electrical energy.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;II Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite LEDs Enabled by the Functionalization of Sulfaguanidine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of sulfaguanidine (SG) molecules effectively passivates Sn2+&#8208;related defects in CsSnI3 perovskite. Moreover, SG molecules promote the growth of crystals with improved morphological uniformity and facilitate balanced carrier injection. As a result, CsSnI3&#8208;SG light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an emission peak at 948 nm achieved a record EQE of 8.1%.








ABSTRACT
Eco&#8208;friendly CsSnI3&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with the emission peak extending to the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region hold tremendous potential for applications in biological monitoring, night vision, and optical communications. However, the various defects caused by the instability of Sn2+ within the CsSnI3 film, and the non&#8208;equilibrium carrier injection rate in the devices are the two major factors that limit the device performance. Here, we report high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CsSnI3&#8208;based PeLEDs achieved by employing functional sulfaguanidine (SG) molecules. Due to the strong S&#9552;O&#9472;Sn coordination bonds, NH2&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; hydrogen bonds could be formed between CsSnI3 and SG, which effectively eliminated various Sn(II)&#8208;related defects in the CsSnI3 film. Moreover, the SG molecules significantly improved the morphological uniformity and regulated the carrier injection balance, resulting in more balanced carrier injection that enhanced the effective radiation recombination rate. Consequently, the optimized CsSnI3&#8208;SG PeLEDs achieved a breakthrough external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.1%, which is the highest efficiency reported for CsSnI3&#8208;based PeLEDs to date.

CuPA and ZnPA carbonyl group facilitates lithium storage by a reversible enolization reaction, while the activated benzene ring exhibits redox activity for reversible lithiation/delithiation, with Cu2+ irreversibly reducing to Cu&#8314;, while Zn2+ remains stable. CaPA enables efficient lithium storage by the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions on its (100) crystallographic plane.








Abstract
This study employs molecular engineering to modulate HOMO levels and electronic structures, designing high&#8208;performance phthalate&#8208;based anodes (ZnPA, CaPA, CuPA) to address challenges like limited capacity and poor cycling in organic lithium&#8208;ion batteries. CuPA delivers 749 mAh g&#8722;1after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1and retains 200 mAh g&#8722;1after 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. ZnPA achieves 650 mAh g&#8722;1at 0.1 A g&#8722;1and maintains 200 mAh g&#8722;1after 1500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. CaPA shows increased capacity at higher current (197 mAh g&#8722;1at 1 A g&#8722;1) due to (100) plane expansion. Redox mechanisms differ: CuPA and ZnPA carbonyl group facilitates lithium storage by a reversible enolization reaction, while the activated benzene ring exhibits redox activity for reversible lithiation/delithiation, with Cu2+ irreversibly reducing to Cu&#8314;, while Zn2+ remains stable. CaPA enables efficient lithium storage by the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions on its (100) crystallographic plane. Full cells with LiFePO4 exhibit excellent performance: CuPA||LFP and ZnPA||LFP retain over 50% capacity after 1000 cycles; CaPA||LFP shows outstanding rate capability (103 mAh g&#8722;1at 4C). This work demonstrates that molecular structural engineering is an effective strategy for enhancing organic electrode materials.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Kill Nano&#8208;Disruptor Integrating Ion Interference, Metabolic Inhibition, and Immune Activation for Augmented Apoptosis and Pyroptosis&#8208;Mediated Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiphase phase transition nano&#8208;disruptor (V&#8208;MoS2&amp;CaF2@HA) is designed to tackle multiple immune&#8208;suppressive mechanisms in tumors. Vanadium&#8208;doping engineering induces the coexistence of the 2H (semiconducting) phase and 1T (metallic) phase, maximizing the ability of piezocatalysts to enhance charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Concurrently, calcium ion self&#8208;amplifying leakage and hydrogen sulfide liberation collectively establish an &#8220;ion interference&#8208;metabolic hijacking&#8221; effect.








Abstract
Ion&#8208;overload&#8208;mediated pyroptosis can enhance cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration and systemic immunity, presenting a promising strategy to strengthen immunotherapy efficacy. However, the low frequency of pro&#8208;inflammatory immune cells and the immunosuppressive tumor network pose substantial challenges to achieving potent immunogenic cell death. This study designs a multiphase phase&#8208;transition nano&#8208;disruptor (V&#8208;MoS2&amp;CaF2@HA), inspired by ionic interference and metabolic inhibition, to target multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms in tumors. Vanadium&#8208;doping engineering induces the coexistence of the 2H (semiconducting) and 1T (metallic) phases, maximizing the ability of piezocatalysts to enhance charge&#8208;carrier mobility. Critically, V&#8208;MoS2 with its ultrathin, asymmetrical layered architecture, reinforces the piezoelectric response by promoting band bending and charge&#8208;carrier separation, thereby establishing favorable conditions for efficient electron&#8211;hole separation and reactive oxygen species generation. Concurrently, calcium&#8208;ion self&#8208;amplifying leakage and hydrogen sulfide liberation collectively create an &#8220;ion&#8208;interference&#8211;metabolic&#8208;hijacking&#8221; effect that induces oxidative stress, amplifies innate immune cGAS&#8211;STING pathway activation, and triggers a pyroptosis&#8211;apoptosis cross&#8208;death effect and immune activation. Thus, the study offers a straightforward strategy to achieve antitumor immunity through STING pathway activation and provides a new avenue to robustly activate immunogenic cell death for tumor treatment.

         <title>Calcium&#8208;Powered Probiotics Reconfigure the Intestinal Niche via Biofilm Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A niche reconfiguration&#8208;driven strategy for probiotics&#8217; colonization enhancement is introduced. This therapy involves the coordination&#8208;driven modification of the Des&#8208;antagonistic probiotic Lactobacillus strain, designated Ca2+/KAE@Lap, using Ca2+ and KAE, a natural calcium&#8208;modulating component. By specifically targeting the tripartite causes of colonization resistance mediated by Desulfovibrio biofilms, Ca2+/KAE@Lap ensures calcium&#8208;bridged interfacial binding for enhanced elimination of pathogen and calcium&#8208;restored mucoprotein regeneration for mucus layer remodeling. The Ca2+/KAE@Lap therapeutic intervention drives biofilm composition from Desulfovibrio&#8208;dominated to Lactobacillus&#8208;enriched consortia, concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen&#8208;permissive to a probiotic&#8208;favored state.








ABSTRACT
Excessive Desulfovibrio (Des) forms biofilm to enable dominant occupation of the intestinal niche, representing a common pathogenic driver of multiple inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) types. Colonization resistance constitutes the primary barrier to antagonistic probiotic efficacy, and this is driven by the pathogen&#8208;favorable microenvironment established by Des. Here, probiotic Lactiplantibacillus (Lap) is modified by calcium ions (Ca2+) and calcium&#8208;regulative polyphenol (kaempferol&#8208;3&#8208;O&#8208;rutinoside, KAE) via coordinate interaction to achieve intestinal niche reconfiguration. Targeting the tripartite mechanisms of Des&#8208;mediated colonization resistance, the Ca2+/KAE@Lap platform optimized niche competition through Ca2+&#8208;bridged interfacial binding with directional bactericidal activity, and this enables bacterial replacement at occupied sites. Ca2+/KAE@Lap reestablishes calcium homeostasis disrupted by Des via synergistic Ca2+/KAE regulation, dually restoring epithelial energy metabolism and mucus layer reconstitution, counteracting Des&#8208;induced colonized sites contraction and regenerated site impairment. This drives phenotypic shift in biofilm composition from Des&#8208;dominated to Lap&#8208;enriched consortia, which is concomitant with the redirection of intestinal colonization resistance from a pathogen&#8208;permissive to a probiotic&#8208;favored state. This calcium&#8208;based biofilm transformation strategy overcomes the transient colonization limitation inherent in conventional probiotic therapies by effectively disrupting colonization resistance in IBD treatment.

         <title>An Inter&#8208;Locking Quasi&#8208;Solid Cathode for Zinc&#8208;Bromine Batteries with Stable 32000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208;locking quasi&#8208;soild cathode encapsulates the tribromide molecules within the charged bromine cathode, suppressing bromine dissolution and mitigating self&#8208;discharge. Meanwhile, the flexibility of PAM accommodates volume changes, ensuring stability of the conductive skeleton. Thus, the constructed Zn&#8208;Br2 battery exhibits an exceptional cyclability of &#8776;32000 cycles.









Abstract
Zinc&#8208;bromine static batteries employing solid bromine cathodes present compelling advantages of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and extended&#8208;lifespan for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, solid&#8208;state bromine cathodes suffer from polybromide&#8208;induced shuttle effects and substantial volume variations, leading to poor reversibility and severe self&#8208;discharge. Herein, an inter&#8208;locking, quasi&#8208;solid bromine cathode enabling energetic static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries are developed. Theoretical calculation and characterizations confirm that polyacrylamide (PAM) effectively encapsulates tribromide molecules within the charged bromine cathode, suppressing bromine dissolution and mitigating self&#8208;discharge. Meanwhile, its flexibility accommodates volume changes and maintains conductive integrity. The resultant zinc&#8208;bromine battery achieves &#8776;32000 cycles at 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an ultralow decay rate of 0.00016% per cycle. Meanwhile, it delivers scalable areal capacity up to 50 mAh cm&#8722;2. Pouch cell with 200 mAh demonstrates remarkable stability of 3500 cycles, while displays capacity retention of &#8776;93% after 48&#160;h resting. The 1.5 Ah pouch cell delivers a practical energy density of 70&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of pouch cell, while its modular integration (&#8776;18&#160;Wh) enables storage of hybrid energy harvesting from solar and wind sources, demonstrating versatile applicability in multi&#8208;scenario energy systems. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for developing practical zinc&#8208;bromine batteries toward grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

Theoretical calculation and characterizations confirm that polyacrylamide (PAM) effectively encapsulates tribromide molecules within the charged bromine cathode, suppressing bromine dissolution and mitigating self-discharge. Meanwhile, its flexibility accommodates volume changes and maintains conductive integrity. The resultant zinc-bromine battery achieves &#8776;32000 cycles at 1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with an ultralow decay rate of 0.00016% per cycle. Meanwhile, it delivers scalable areal capacity up to 50 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Pouch cell with 200 mAh demonstrates remarkable stability of 3500 cycles, while displays capacity retention of &#8776;93% after 48&#160;h resting. The 1.5 Ah pouch cell delivers a practical energy density of 70&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the total mass of pouch cell, while its modular integration (&#8776;18&#160;Wh) enables storage of hybrid energy harvesting from solar and wind sources, demonstrating versatile applicability in multi-scenario energy systems. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for developing practical zinc-bromine batteries toward grid-scale energy storage applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Gradient Oxygenophilic Architecture on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Dynamic Spillover and Bifunctional Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise control of competitive adsorption behavior of H* and OH* intermediates represents a fundamental challenge in hydrogen electrocatalysis. By engineering gradient oxyphilic sites within high&#8208;entropy alloys, we create continuous energy landscapes that enable low&#8208;barrier spillover pathways, break conventional scaling relations, and overcome kinetic limitations&#8212;transcending the static Sabatier principle through dynamic surface regulation.








ABSTRACT
Breaking scaling relations and overcoming kinetic limitations in multistep hydrogen electrocatalysis remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized a high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst comprising Ir, Ru, Mo, W, and Cu supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon spheres. This unique structure creates active sites with a quasi&#8208;continuous distribution of binding energies for H* and OH* intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the random spatial arrangement of sites enables low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier spillover pathways for H* and OH* (&#967;H*max = 0.27&#160;eV; &#967;OH*max = 0.61&#160;eV), while continuous d&#8208;orbital coupling facilitates efficient electron transfer. This design enables each elementary step of hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) to be directed to a site with favorable energetics. As a result, it exhibits exceptional bifunctional performance with a HOR mass activity of 8.83 A mg&#8722;1 and an HER overpotential of only 11&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/Ccom and previously reported catalysts. Operando spectroscopy and DFT analyses reveal that the gradient energy landscape promotes dynamic intermediate spillover, preventing site blocking and enhancing reaction kinetics. This work establishes a universal design strategy develop high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that transcend conventional Sabatier principle limitations.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Fe Nanoclusters: Unlocking Ultrafast Kinetics, Exceptional Stability, and Unambiguous Mechanism in Faradaic Capacitive Deionization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nanometer Fe nanoclusters were unprecedentedly synthesized via a universal pore&#8208;mediated vapor diffusion method as the anode for Faradaic capacitive deionization, enabling ultrafast and durable desalination while revealing the unambiguous mechanism of Fe&#8208;based chloride storage.








Abstract
Ultrasmall metal nanoclusters (MNCs, &lt;2 nm) are emerging materials with unique properties, yet synthesizing non&#8208;coinage MNCs, especially high&#8208;melting&#8208;point elements like Fe, Ti, and Mn, remains challenging due to the lack of mild, general strategies, hindering applications such as electrochemical desalination. Herein, a universal &#8220;pore&#8208;mediated vapor diffusion&#8221; (PVD) method is reported to synthesize sub&#8208;nanometer Fe NCs (0.8 nm) within mesoporous carbon spheres, tackling the critical bottleneck issue of faradaic capacitive deionization (FDI)&#8211;a promising approach for mitigating global water scarcity. This approach bypasses high&#8208;temperature requirements and extends to other refractory metals. As a FDI anode, the Fe NC electrode achieves a record salt adsorption capacity of 116.83 mgCl g&#8722;1, an ultrahigh rate of 0.57 mgCl g&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and exceptional stability (86.47% retention after 200 cycles). The sub&#8208;nanometer structure enables ultrafast ion diffusion and stress mitigation, overcoming persistent kinetic and stability limitations in FDI. Through operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and DFT, the chloride storage mechanism is identified as a conversion reaction (Fe NCs + Cl&#8722; &#8652; FeOCl), resolving key ambiguities at the atomic level in Fe electrochemistry. This work provides a versatile synthesis platform for non&#8208;coinage MNCs and atomic&#8208;level mechanistic insights, advancing next&#8208;generation desalination technologies.

         <title>Inhibition of Interregional Charge Transfer Transition in Asymmetrical Heteroatomic Framework Enables BT.2020 Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence with EQE Exceeding 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triple&#8208;borylated isomers TBNO&#8208;1 and TBNO&#8208;2 are designed via &#960;&#8208;extensions and heteroatom regulations. Distinct interregional charge transfer contributions are identified in their excited states, resulting in different spectral behaviors across various environments. Consequently, while both emitters can afford impressive external quantum efficiency exceeding 40%, only TBNO&#8208;2 can afford electroluminescence satisfying the BT.2020 standard with CIE&#8208;y coordinate of 0.044.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;boron/nitrogen/oxygen (B/N/O)&#8208;embedded polyaromatics featuring the multiple resonance (MR) effect are popular photoluminescent emitters that meet the BT.2020 blue standard, while they often fail to achieve this in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because the uneven electron&#8208;donating properties of N/O atoms make them sensitive to their surrounding environments. Herein, taking such an emitter as the prototype and developing two triple&#8208;borylated isomers (TBNO&#8208;1 and TBNO&#8208;2) via &#960;&#8208;extensions and heteroatom regulations. Both emitters display highly efficient thermally activated delay fluorescence properties and nearly identical narrowband emission with CIE&#8208;y coordinates far exceeding the BT.2020 standard in toluene as the prototype does due to their similar core patterns. On the other hand, their emission spectra differ in other environments due to their different interregional charge transfer (IRCT) characters. Importantly, due to the strategically opposed oxygen atoms, TBNO&#8208;2 demonstrates uniformly delocalized wavefunctions and a much&#8208;suppressed IRCT contribution than TBNO&#8208;1, and thus exhibits minimal spectral variations across diverse environments. In OLEDs, while both emitters can afford impressive external quantum efficiency exceeding 40%, only TBNO&#8208;2 can afford electroluminescence satisfying the BT.2020 standard with CIE&#8208;y coordinate of 0.044. This work offers valuable insights for finely modulating the photophysical properties of MR emitters to realize BT.2020 blue electroluminescence.

         <title>Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Magnetic Domain Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneously formed labyrinthine magnetic domains are harnessed as a physical entropy source to construct a reconfigurable spintronic physical unclonable function. By electrically reading domain configurations through magnetic tunnel junctions, unique and random responses are generated, demonstrating strong temperature robustness, machine&#8208;learning resistance, and potential for secure key generation and hardware&#8208;level authentication.








Abstract
Ensuring authentication, data security, and privacy has become critically important with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) employ the intrinsic physical randomness of materials to generate unique, nonreplicable outputs, ensuring device authenticity and protection against cloning. Although silicon&#8208;based PUFs have significantly advanced, developing practical and cost&#8208;effective solutions for resource&#8208;constrained embedded systems remains challenging. This study demonstrates a reconfigurable PUF design that leverages spontaneously formed labyrinth domain patterns in magnetic thin films as a high&#8208;entropy source, without requiring any external stimuli or control. The resulting PUFs display nearly ideal performance in uniqueness, uniformity, bit&#8208;aliasing, and robustness, underscoring their practicality and reliability. These PUFs demonstrate high indivisibility in linear feature spaces and robustness against compromising the security or functionality of machine learning. More importantly, the electrical readout of domain&#8208;based PUF signals is demonstrated using magnetic tunnel junctions and propose an architecture for integrating the PUF system with existing silicon&#8208;based circuits. Overall, the proposed PUF system offers a practical and innovative solution for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting measures and secure device identification.

Overall, the proposed PUF system offers a practical and innovative solution for advanced anti-counterfeiting measures and secure device identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multimaterials by Patterning Microphase Separation of a Single Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single copolymer is programmed into multimaterials by arresting microphase separation at different stages. This strategy enables seamless integration of regions resembling tough plastics or tough rubbers, providing a general platform for rigid&#8211;soft integrated devices.








Abstract
Living systems achieve robustness by integrating soft and rigid components into seamless architectures, yet synthetic emulation of this strategy remains limited. Here, we present a strategy to generate multimaterials from a single copolymer by patterning phase separation. Specifically, we design a block copolymer of metastable nanostructure, and then spatially program photocrosslinking to locally arrest phase separation at different levels during annealing, thereby producing patterns that span moduli from regimes of rubbers to plastics. The resulting multimaterial exhibits spatially distinct mechanical properties, but is chemically identical, and is seamlessly integrated through a shared polymer network topology. This approach inherently eliminates interfacial incompatibility of dissimilar materials, enhances structural integrity of the multimaterial, and establishes a versatile platform for programmable, multiscale rigid&#8208;soft integrated devices.

         <title>Giant Energy&#8208;Storage in Pb&#8208;Free Relaxor Ferroelectrics via Atomic&#8208;level Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rapid decline in high&#8208;field polarizability of conventional relaxor ferroelectrics limits the enhancement of their energy&#8208;storage performance. An atomic&#8208;level design strategy is proposed that integrates framework, ferroelectric&#8208;active, rattling, and insulating ions. This strategy induces a cooperative local polarization enhancement and rattling effects, which enables the achievement of a record&#8208;high energy density of 24.3&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with an efficiency of 92.4%.








Abstract

Perovskite&#8208;structured relaxor ferroelectrics have been extensively studied as dielectric energy&#8208;storage capacitors, with applications across various electronics and electrical power systems. However, substantial improvements in energy&#8208;density are typically hindered by early polarization saturation and a rapid decline in polarizability under high&#8208;fields. To address this challenge, an atomic&#8208;level design strategy is presented that integrates framework, ferroelectric&#8208;active, rattling ions at A&#8208;site and insulating ions at B&#8208;site to induce a cooperative local polarization enhancement and rattling effects. Large&#8208;scale simulations and local structure analysis based on neutron total scattering reveal that large&#8208;sized framework ions enable local polarization enhancement of small ferroelectric&#8208;active and rattling ions through size differences. Rattling ions, endowed with an expanded displacement space, heighten field&#8208;driven polar extension, thereby slowing the reduction of polarizability under high&#8208;fields. Guided by this strategy, (Ba0.5Bi0.25Na0.25)(Ti,Zr)O3 system is elaborately designed, which exhibits favorable polarization behavior featured with deferred polarization saturation and record&#8208;high polarizability under an ultrahigh breakdown field. Consequently, the optimal composition demonstrates a giant energy density of 24.3&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with a high efficiency of 92.4%, outperforming current bulk ceramic capacitors. The work establishes a universal design paradigm for relaxor ferroelectrics toward next&#8208;generation dielectric capacitors, and provides a theoretical framework for the chemical design of function&#8208;orientated complex ferroelectrics.

         <title>Humidity&#8208;Gated Memristive Dynamics Enabling Near&#8208;Sensor Spiking Computation for Wind Direction and Noise&#8208;Resilient Speech Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aa neuromorphic humidity sensor using an Ag/Nafion/ITO memristor that enables event&#8208;driven encoding via humidity&#8208;dependent threshold switching is reported. The system converts slow environmental changes into spikes, supporting low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time tasks such as wind direction inference and speech recognition. This work advances energy&#8208;efficient, edge&#8208;intelligent sensing for slowly varying environmental stimuli.








Abstract
Spiking in&#8208;sensor systems rely on discrete input transitions to enable event&#8208;driven encoding. However, humidity signals change gradually and continuously, lacking intrinsic thresholds required for spike generation. This mismatch poses a fundamental challenge for applying in&#8208;sensor spiking computation to humidity. Here, a neuromorphic humidity&#8208;sensing platform based on a threshold&#8208;switching memristor with an asymmetric Ag/Nafion/ITO structure is reported. The Nafion layer serves both as a humidity transduction medium and as an electrochemical matrix for silver filament formation. Increased ambient humidity reduces ionic migration barriers, enabling volatile conductance changes over six orders of magnitude and switching speeds down to 60&#160;ns. Importantly, the switching threshold decreases from 0.8 V at 50% relative humidity to 0.2 V at 90%, providing an embedded gating mechanism that produces spikes only when humidity exceeds defined levels. To evaluate the system in practical scenarios, real&#8208;time classification of spatiotemporal humidity gradients for wind direction inference, as well as noise&#8208;resilient speech recognition via exhalation&#8208;induced humidity cues is demonstrated. These results demonstrate a hardware&#8208;level strategy for event&#8208;driven encoding of slow environmental dynamics, offering a pathway toward efficient, low&#8208;power sensory systems for edge&#8208;intelligent applications.

         <title>Bulk Fabrication of Space&#8208;Confined CsPbI3 Nanocrystal Films Toward Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk fabricated CsPbI3 nanocrystal films of &#8764;700&#160;nm emission are demonstrated with strong space confinement and minimized trap density. Modulated grain nucleation and growth, together with Lewis base coordination, enable the crystallization of high quality CsPbI3 nanocrystals. The resultant deep&#8208;red PeLEDs achieve a record EQE of 23.4% and an ultrahigh luminance of 10152&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








ABSTRACT
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with 690&#8722;710&#160;nm emission show high significance in optical, agricultural, and biomedical applications. As primary candidates for deep&#8208;red emitters, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 films suffer from fused large grains with abundant trap states, leading to inferior performance of deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Here we report CsPbI3 nanocrystal films with strong space confinement and notable performance at &#8764;700&#160;nm of deep&#8208;red emission via bulk fabrication. The dual roles of diaza&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 dihydriodide additive as crystallization regulator and Lewis base ligand trigger more nucleation sites, retarded grain growth and passivated trap states, ensuring the crystallization of high&#8208;quality space&#8208;confined CsPbI3 nanocrystal films. This approach establishes a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% for deep&#8208;red PeLEDs, and achieves a maximum luminance of 10152&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Low roll&#8208;off is also demonstrated that EQE maintain over 20% under a high current density of 900&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;red organic and quantum&#8208;dot LEDs. The T50 operating lifetime is estimated to be 234 h at an initial radiance of 6.3&#160;W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work provides an effectual strategy to accelerate radiative recombination and enhance the performance of CsPbI3&#8208;based deep&#8208;red PeLEDs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Polar Order Engineering Enables Near&#8208;Ideal Efficiency in Lead&#8208;Free Energy Storage Perovskite</title>

Lead&#8208;free NaNbO3&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics achieve a record 95% efficiency and high dielectric energy density via multi&#8208;polar order engineering. Sub&#8208;angstrom electron polarization, atomic displacement enhancement, nanodomain design, and electrical microstructure unification enable ultrafast discharge and superior thermal stability, offering a sustainable alternative to toxic lead&#8208;based dielectrics for high voltage capacitor applications.








Abstract
Toxic lead&#8208;based dielectrics dominate high&#8208;performance capacitors, creating urgent environmental and supply&#8208;chain challenges. Multi&#8208;polar order engineering is deployed to create an industrially scalable lead&#8208;free perovskite achieving simultaneous record efficiency (&#951; &#8776; 95%) and energy density (12 J cm&#8722;3). Phase&#8208;field simulations are also used to guide micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano domain design to construct switchable polar nano region that delay polarization saturation. Crucially, sub&#8208;angstrom electronic state optimization &#8211; previously unexplored in energy storage dielectrics &#8211; is revealed as pivotal: synchrotron XAS quantifies Nb&#8208;O dipole ionicity enhancement via electronic polarization, while atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy statistically confirms bond&#8208;length homogenization and distortion reduction that structurally anchor this effect. This hierarchical atomic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic control reshapes the electrical microstructure, enabling unified charge dynamics (validated by DRT analysis) that deliver ultrafast field response (&lt;32&#160;ns discharge) and exceptional thermal resilience (&lt; &#177;4% current fluctuation, 25&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C). Fabricated from commodity precursors, the material eliminates the reliance on rare&#8208;earth precursors that are common in PLZT production, significantly lowering costs while mitigating environmental impacts. Overall, this work establishes a sustainable pathway for grid&#8208;scale power electronics.

         <title>Decoupling the Failure Mechanism of 360 Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Ion Pouch Cell During Overcharging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation into the structural and interfacial failure mechanisms of 360 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cells during overcharging reveals that performance degradation is primarily attributed to interfacial degradation of the SiOx@Graphite anode, preferential lithium plating on graphite, adverse graphite&#8208;SiOx interactions, and crosstalk from dissolved Ni2+ ions. The dissolved Ni ions are found to deposit predominantly in lithium&#8208;plated regions as organometallic&#8208; Ni2+ complexes.








Abstract
Increasing the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) raises safety risks. Understanding failure mechanisms, especially during abuse, is essential for improved battery design and management. In this study, multiscale characterization techniques are employed to systematically investigate the overcharge behavior (from 100% to 130% state of charge) of a 360 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch cell with Ni&#8208;rich cathode and SiOx@Graphite anode. Further decoupling elucidates that the primary failure mechanism is the interfacial and structural degradation of the anode, including lithium plating on graphite, volume expansion and crack propagation in SiOx particles, and continuous reconstruction of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film, which are further promoted by dissolved Ni ions (the Ni content on the anode increases from 0.005% to 0.268% after overcharging to 5.25 V) and by released oxygen species from the Ni&#8208;rich cathode. Ni ions (mainly as Ni2+) accumulate on Li&#8208;plating areas on graphite. These crosstalk reactions significantly influence the stability of both electrodes, causing severe phase transition (from LiC6 to LiC12 on the anode and from layered to rock&#8208;salt phase on the cathode), continuous electrolyte decomposition and harmful gas evolution, which accelerates full&#8208;cell failure. These findings can provide guidance for the optimization of battery safety management systems.

         <title>Thermally Switchable Photoactivity in Azobenzene&#8208;Functionalized DNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of linear DNA nanomachines exhibit selective photo&#8208;responsive deformations according to temperature. At higher temperatures, the DNA condensates are in a liquid&#8208;like state and elongate under visible light, while at lower temperatures, the DNA condensates become more gel&#8208;like and elongate under UV light.








Abstract
Soft materials capable of responding to diverse environmental stimuli are fundamental to advancing soft robotics and intelligent biomedical devices, enabling adaptive, life&#8208;like functions. Here, multimodal photothermal adaptability is reported in azobenzene&#8208;conjugated DNA condensates assembled via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates exhibit a striking temperature&#8208;dependent inversion of their photo&#8208;response: at elevated temperatures, the liquid&#8208;like droplets deform under visible light and dissolve under ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas at lower temperatures, the gel&#8208;like condensates are reshaped by UV light while remaining inert to visible light. This unique bidirectional control is attributed to the synergy of confined azobenzene photochemistry within DNA duplexes and a pronounced isomer&#8208;dependent shift in the system's glass transition and melting temperatures. This platform of multi&#8208;responsive photofluids opens new avenues for applications demanding exquisite spatiotemporal control.

         <title>Thermal Switching of Polymer Topology Enables Programmable Mechanical Properties in Soft Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the effects of annealing temperature (T) on polymer architectures. Brush&#8208;like, super&#8208;soft amorphous structures transform into rigid, crystalline ones upon high&#8208;T annealing. Re&#8208;annealing at a lower T yields a stable soft state, demonstrating reversible control over material properties.








Abstract
Soft materials with on&#8208;demand mechanical tunability remain challenging to realize, particularly those capable of large, reversible, and programmable changes within a single material system. In this work, a synthetic elastomer is designed that undergoes thermally reversible topological network reconfiguration, switching between brush&#8208; and linear&#8208;like architectures, thereby enabling a reversible transition from soft to stiff mechanical states. This reconfiguration is achieved by grafting crystallizable side chains onto a polymer backbone via Diels&#8208;Alder (DA) adducts at low annealing temperatures to form brush&#8208;like networks, while retro&#8208;DA reactions at higher temperatures release the side chains, yielding a linear topology. The brush architecture suppresses crystallization, whereas the linear form facilitates crystallinity to form an additional crystalline framework, leading to a reversible rubbery&#8208;to&#8208;glassy transition. As a result, the elastomers undergoing annealing cycles between 60 and 130&#160;&#176;C exhibit reversible enhancements in stiffness and strength by up to 286&#8208;fold and 25&#8208;fold, respectively. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations reveal that the significantly improved stiffness and strength originate from the formation of a crystalline framework that effectively bears mechanical load and impedes crack propagation. This thermally programmable strategy enables dynamic control of mechanical behavior, offering a novel paradigm for designing intelligent materials with tailored and on&#8208;demand performance.

         <title>Aqueously Upcycled Lignin with Emergent Tribonegativity for Skin&#8208;Integrated Triboelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueously upcycled lignin is transformed into a printable ink that self&#8208;assembles into a nanotextured surface during printing with the highest reported biopolymer&#8208;based tribonegativity. The resulting skin&#8208;integrated triboelectric sensor enables high&#8208;fidelity cardiovascular monitoring and objective mental workload classification, demonstrating a scalable route to high&#8208;performance, sustainable electronics from otherwise wasted biomass.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Aqueously upcycled lignin is transformed into a printable ink that self-assembles into a nanotextured surface during printing with the highest reported biopolymer-based tribonegativity. The resulting skin-integrated triboelectric sensor enables high-fidelity cardiovascular monitoring and objective mental workload classification, demonstrating a scalable route to high-performance, sustainable electronics from otherwise wasted biomass.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thermoelectric Fabric of PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT@PU Composite Fibers for Body&#8208;Temperature Monitoring and Fever Alarming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using polyurethane&#8208;encapsulated PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT fibers, the assembled thermoelectric fabric demonstrates high and stable output performance under various mechanical deformations. A fabric&#8208;integrated intelligent fever&#8208;monitoring system enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time body&#8208;temperature tracking.








Abstract
Integrated flexible thermoelectric (TE) fabric demonstrates great potential for wearable energy harvesting and intelligent temperature sensing. However, existing TE fibers often struggle to simultaneously satisfy requirements&#160;for high and stable TE performance, favorable weavability, sweat resistance, and good biocompatibility. Herein, continuous PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT composite fibers with these desirable features are obtained via a convenient freeze&#8208;thaw&#8208;induced gelation process assisted wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting a high electrical conductivity of 1960 S cm&#8722;1, a large power factor of 59.6 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, and a high tensile strength of 103 MPa. Polyurethane&#8208;encapsulated composite fibers further provide superior mechanical flexibility, desirable weavability, remarkable washability, low&#8208;temperature tolerance, and stable TE performance over 1000 bending/twisting cycles.&#160;A resulting TE fabric comprising 32 p&#8208;type legs achieves a power density of 60.1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at temperature difference of 50 K, surpassing most reported PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based fiber devices, and retains over 95% performance after various mechanical deformations. The developed fabric&#8208;integrated intelligent fever monitoring system (forehead/wrist/armpit) exhibits high sensitivity (alarm response &lt; 5&#160;s) and good repeatability (3&#8211;4.3 s response over 50 cycles) for low/high fever monitoring. Such composite TE fibers are anticipated to advance practical applications of wearable TE fabrics in body energy harvesting, personalized healthcare, and intelligent fitness monitoring.

         <title>Dimeric Acceptors Featuring an Electron&#8208;Rich Fused&#8208;Ring Linker Enable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report two novel dimerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors for ternary organic solar cells. The optimized device achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 20.26 % and demonstrates exceptional operational stability, retaining over 86 % of initial PCE after 1430 h under high humidity. A 15.6 cm2 module also shows 17.63 % efficiency, proving the strategy's scalability for high&#8208;performance OSCs.








ABSTRACT
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are a promising renewable energy technology; however, balancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) with long&#8208;term stability remains challenging. Herein, we report two novel dimerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (DSMAs), GSNS&#8208;EH and GSNS&#8208;C8, that feature electron&#8208;rich planar pyrrolodithiophene bridges with tailored side chains. The optimized acceptor, GSNS&#8208;EH, with a branched 2&#8208;ethylhexyl chain, exhibited enhanced crystallinity and molecular ordering, reduced non&#8208;radiative losses, and improved blend morphology when incorporated into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 host system as a third component. The resulting ternary OSC exhibited a PCE of 20.26 %, which is among the highest values reported for DSMA&#8208;based ternary devices. Moreover, the GSNS&#8208;EH&#8208;based cell exhibited exceptional operational stability, maintaining 86.7 % of its initial PCE after 1430&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under high humidity (85 % &#177; 10 %) and 97.2 % after 1460&#160;h at 85&#176;C. The excellent scalability of this approach is demonstrated by a 15.6 cm2 module achieving a high PCE of 17.63 %. Thus, this study provides an effective molecular design strategy toward highly efficient, stable, and scalable OSCs.

         <title>Wood Hydroplasticization Toward Ultra&#8208;Strong and Self&#8208;Densified Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel hydroplasticization method that enables microstructural regulation, converting porous wood into ultra&#8208;strong, self&#8208;densified complex architectures without the need for mechanical hot&#8208;pressing, is reported.








Abstract
Wood has been one of the most widely used sustainable materials for millennia, but its limited mechanical properties and formability have restricted its application in diverse structural contexts. In this study, we elucidate the mechanisms governing the micromechanical behaviors of wood and the strengthening effects achieved through room&#8208;temperature hydroplasticization. This process transforms wood into ultra&#8208;strong, self&#8208;densified structures with customizable shapes, driven by system deformation and energy dissipation. These effects are governed by the interplay between polymer matrix elasticity and interfacial sliding response. Notably, the hydroplasticization method enables the attainment of a high flexural strength (483 MPa), surpassing that of mechanically compressed wood and traditional materials like steel and aluminum alloys. These findings introduce new possibilities for developing complex load&#8208;bearing structures that are previously unachievable with conventional wood.

         <title>Programmable Multicolor Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Hydrogels via the Synergy of Freeze&#8208;Soaking and Salting&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal freeze&#8208;soaking and salting&#8208;out strategy enables multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels. By embedding phosphors within polymer microcrystalline domains, this method yields long&#8208;lived afterglow (&gt;10 s) in highly hydrated and flexible gels. Emission color and lifetime can be finely tuned through salt type, concentration, or dye incorporation, highlighting a broadly adaptable platform for phosphorescent soft materials.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is rarely achieved in hydrogel systems, as water severely quenches their emission. Achieving multicolor RTP in hydrogels is even more challenging, despite its high potential in cutting&#8208;edge applications such as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and camouflaging skins. Here, a universal strategy is presented to fabricate multicolor RTP hydrogels through the cascading freeze&#8208;soaking and salting&#8208;out process (F&#8208;S method). This method induces in situ polymer assembly around the phosphors, providing effective confinement and protection against quenching. As a result, RTP hydrogel (RTPgel) with strong phosphorescence (lifetime &gt; 200&#160;ms and afterglow &gt;10 s), high water content (71 %), and excellent flexibility (stretchability &gt; 3000%) is achieved in a modal system composed of polycyclic aromatic boronic acids (PABAs)&#8208;grafted polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Since chain aggregation strongly correlates with the kosmotropic nature of the salt solution, the phosphorescence properties, including lifetime and intensity, are feasibly tunable by re&#8208;soaking the hydrogels in solution with different types of salts or concentrations, enabling programmable spatiotemporal emission patterns. Such a method is universal, adaptable for various luminophores and polymer matrices, allowing customizable emission colors across a wide spectrum. Moreover, it is compatible with scalable, high&#8208;precision fabrication techniques such as fiber spinning, direct ink writing (DIW), and digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing.

Moreover, it is compatible with scalable, high-precision fabrication techniques such as fiber spinning, direct ink writing (DIW), and digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wood Microchannel&#8208;Confined Assembly of Cellulosic Liquid Crystals for Modulable Chromatic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulable chromatic materials are developed via wood microchannel confined assembly of cellulosic liquid crystal. Precise and reversible regulation over the nanoscale cholesteric structure of the iridescent units is achieved by temperature&#8208;related hydration degree, endowing active color tuning and customizable patterning across the visible spectrum. This wood&#8208;based material has considerable potential for utilization in sustainable, intelligent photonic devices.








Abstract
Endowing wood with a tunable wide range of colors for sustainable optical functionality is attractive but challenging. The existing wood coloring approaches based on heterogeneous additives and petroleum&#8208;based monomers are limited by dye diffusion, reduced eco&#8208;friendliness, and non&#8208;adjustable optical properties. Here, modulable chromatic wood materials (CW) are developed based on native wood microchannel&#8208;confined assembly of cellulosic liquid crystal (CLC). The CLC assemblies with nanoscale cholesteric helical pitch are constrained and integrated through microchannel boundary conditions provided by delignified wood skeletons, effectively realizing precise ordered structural regulation and stability improvement. The nanostructure of the pixel&#8208;like discrete iridescent units in CW can be actively regulated due to the reversible temperature&#8208;related hydration degree, forming adjustable photonic arrays for reliable on&#8208;demand patterning and covering a substantial gamut in the visible spectrum (419&#8211;695 nm). Besides, the utilization of a high proportion of bio&#8208;based derivatives (&#8776;93.1 wt.%) dramatically reduces potential ecotoxicity and improves biodegradability. We foresee CW will serve as sustainable alternatives for the next generation of intelligent full&#8208;color optical devices, covering the fields of digital displaying, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, biomedical imaging, etc.

         <title>Dynamic Reversible Full&#8208;Color&#160;Phosphorescence Afterglows from Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Carboxymethyl Chitosan Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Marine&#8208;derived carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS, n&#8208;electron&#8208;system) with a record 10.1% p&#8208;RTP efficiency hosts trace (0.1 wt%) pyrenedicarboxylate acid sodium salts (PDA, &#960;&#8208;electron&#8208;system). Driven by n&#8208;&#960; synergy via through&#8208;space conjugation, it affords dynamically reversible full&#8208;color p&#8208;RTP afterglows with multi&#8208;stimuli (pH, td, &#955;ex) responsiveness, empowering anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption, information storage, sensing, and phosphorescent textiles.








ABSTRACT
Pure organic stimuli&#8208;responsive persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (p&#8208;RTP) materials hold significant promise for encryption, bioimaging, sensing, and wearable optoelectronics. However, developing highly efficient smart p&#8208;RTP systems featuring full&#8208;color tunability and multi&#8208;dimensional reversible responsiveness remains a long&#8208;standing challenge, especially for nonconventional luminophores lacking significant conjugation. Herein, it is found that marine&#8208;derived carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) exhibits intrinsic excitation&#8208;tunable panchromatic (400&#8211;610&#160;nm) photoluminescence (PL) and a record&#8208;high p&#8208;RTP quantum yield of 10.1% amongst nonconventional polymeric luminophores. Leveraging its outstanding PL, rigid conformation, and, moreover, inherent amino/carboxyl groups, we further construct a pyrenedicarboxylic acid salt&#8208;doped phosphorescence system that demonstrates efficient (8.8%), prolonged (515.1&#160;ms), and dynamically tunable (495&#8211;710&#160;nm) p&#8208;RTP with cyclable control via pH, delay time (td), and excitation wavelength (&#955;ex). Moving beyond conventional aromatic structural modification strategies, this work achieves multimode stimuli&#8208;responsive and efficient p&#8208;RTP through the synergy between nonaromatic CMCS and aromatic chromophores, and the effective control of their intra/intermolecular interactions, chain conformation, and consequent dye aggregation, enabling versatile applications across anti&#8208;counterfeiting, encryption, information storage, and phosphorescent textiles.

         <title>Enabling Single&#8208;Challenge Multichannel&#8208;Response OPUFs: Adaptive Nanofilms from Aggregation&#8208;Controlled Multicolor Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel optical physical unclonable functions&#8208;based anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with single&#8208;challenge, multichannel&#8208;response capability. The platform is enabled by multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission carbon dots produced through surface&#8208;oxidation engineering, together with a hierarchical disorder&#8208;engineering strategy applied across three distinct spatial length scales.








Abstract
Optical physical unclonable functions (OPUFs) provide a powerful and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting solution by harnessing inherent random physical features. However, achieving a balance among multichannel unclonability, scalability, and non&#8208;destructive implementation remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a single&#8208;challenge, multichannel&#8208;response OPUFs label engineered with hierarchical disorder spanning sub&#8208;nanoscale molecular programming, nanoscale assembly amplification, and microscale optical integration. First, by precisely controlling the ratio of surface functional groups, the carbon dots are directed to form either highly aggregated or weakly aggregated states. These aggregation states spontaneously generate sub&#8208;nanoscale fractal structures with intrinsic randomness, which function as physically unclonable fingerprints. Moreover, the random assembly and printing produce irreproducible micro&#8208;nano architectures that are inherently resistant to duplication. The OPUFs validation confirms an ultrahigh theoretical encoding capacity of &#8776;2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;1090. A single 5&#160;&#181;m label generates three independent keys from bright&#8208;field, green, and red channels, exhibiting near&#8208;ideal bit uniformity and exceptionally low error rates. When demonstrated on delicate butterfly specimens, the label integrates seamlessly into protective coatings without damaging microscopic features, providing an &#8220;invisible armor&#8221; with broad applications in secure data storage and high&#8208;precision anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Switching Modulates Lewis Acidity in Ferrihydrite for Enhanced Phosphate Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative strategy is proposed to modulate Lewis acidity by switching high&#8208;spin (HS) Fe3+ to activate t2g&#8594;eg orbital electron transitions, which significantly enhances both adsorption activity and selectivity. Advanced diagnostic tools illustrate this dynamic relationships: spin&#8208;state regulation &#8594; Lewis acidity evolution &#8594; adsorption efficiency. These findings pave the way for designing advanced adsorbents targeting Lewis basic pollutants.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based adsorbents are promising candidates for phosphorus removal, whereas the current progress suffers from the effectiveness of their Lewis acid sites. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to modulates Lewis acidity by switching high&#8208;spin (HS) Fe3+ to activate t2g&#8594;eg orbital electron transitions. Results demonstrate that the weak field ligand effect of sulfur (S) reduces the orbital splitting energy in ferrihydrite (Fh), inducing the generation of HS Fe3+ (eg filling &#8776;0.983). Compared to pristine Fh, the HS S&#8208;Fh exhibits an elevated number of unpaired d electrons (2.36&#8594;3.45), thereby significantly increasing its Lewis acidity. Mechanistic studies reveal that improved electron transfer between P&#8211;O bonds and Fe centers, together with strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, promotes phosphate adsorption, resulting in a 146&#8208;fold improvement in adsorption kinetics. Remarkably, S&#8208;Fh continuous&#8208;flow reactor maintains &#8776;100% phosphate removal after treating over 1200 bed volumes of wastewater. This work emphasizes the crucial role of spin state in regulating Lewis acidity and provides a new design strategy for highly efficient adsorbents.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Conduction Polymer Electrolyte and Stable Interphase Engineering for Room&#8208;/Subzero&#8208;Temperature, Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;conduction polymer electrolyte, coupled with a stable artificial interphase, is engineered to enable long&#8208;cycle all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. This designed electrolyte facilitates rapid ion transport, while the hybrid interphase effectively suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth, resulting in an exceptional 91.2% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C, demonstrating the success of our design.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) are promising due to their exceptional energy density, safety, and abundant sodium resources. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolyte is extensively investigated for ASSSBs, but its practical application is limited by low ionic conductivity and interfacial instability at room/sub&#8209;zero temperatures. Here, a dual&#8208;strategy solid&#8208;state electrolyte design (entirely liquid&#8208;free) is presented in which succinonitrile serves as a plasticizer that synergizes with PEO, creating dual&#8208;ion conduction pathways that achieve an impressive ionic conductivity of 2.75 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Concurrently, sodium difluoro(oxalate)borate undergoes in situ reactions with sodium metal anode, synergizing with the artificially formed NaF interphase layer to facilitate the successful formation of a stable, inorganic salt&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. This mechanism effectively suppresses undesirable side reactions between the polymer and sodium metal anode. Consequently, Na@NaF||Na@NaF symmetric cells exhibit outstanding cycling stability for over 1,500 hours at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under room temperature. Full cells based on Na3V2(PO4)3||Na@NaF retain 91.2% of their initial capacity after 1,000 cycles at 2C. Notably, the ASSSBs deliver a discharge capacity of 88.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, highlighting their suitability for low&#8208;temperature applications. This work establishes an electrolyte&#8208;interface collaborative design paradigm for high&#8208;performance ASSSBs under wide&#8208;temperature operating conditions.

         <title>&#8220;Tear&#8208;And&#8208;Stack&#8221; Twisted SrTiO3 Moir&#233; Superlattices for Precise Interfacial Reconstruction and Polar Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack method enables the creation of twisted SrTiO3 bilayers with accurate twist&#8208;angle control, which yield atomically sharp oxide moir&#233; superlattices with emergent exotic topological polar vortices, thereby opening a new pathway for twistronics based on 2D&#8208;like non&#8208;van der Waals oxides.








Abstract
Oxide&#8208;based moir&#233; superlattice is an emerging field for its exotic properties and abundant design freedom. However, due to the dangling bond and much stronger interlayer adhesion with the supporting substrate, fabricating twisted complex oxide is challenging, and an oxide moir&#233; lattice with a clean interface remains elusive. Here, square moir&#233; superlattices in twisted SrTiO3 (STO) bilayer are constructed using a 2D like &#8220;tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack&#8221; method, achieving unprecedent control resolution and superior interface quality. Through depth&#8208;dependent atomic&#8208;scale analysis and electronic reconstruction, the upper and lower STO layers are found near the twisted interface exhibit opposite shear strain, evidencing a strong coupling confined within 2 unit cells (&#177;0.8&#160;nm) from the interface. The strain gradient of twisted bilayer STO gives rise to alternating clockwise and counter&#8208;clockwise polarization originating from the flexoelectric effect, leading to a large&#8208;scale array of polar vortex. This motivates to fabricate twisted STO bilayers with a freestanding parent layer as thin as 0.8&#160;nm, in which a polar vortex is also confirmed. The &#8220;tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack&#8221; method is generic to create twisted moir&#233; superlattices in a wide range of oxide material systems, and it demonstrates the feasibility of &#8220;2D&#8208;like&#8221; oxide twistronics.

         <title>Collagen&#8208;Derived Nanoconfined Catalytic Membranes for Highly Efficient Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable nanoconfined catalytic membrane is fabricated from collagen fiber networks via mechanical nanofibrillation and tannic acid&#8211;driven Fe3O4 mineralization. The hierarchical nanostructure enhances water permeation and reactive oxygen species utilization, achieving 98.2% tetracycline removal with ultrahigh permeance, providing a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly platform for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Nanoconfined catalytic membranes (NCMs) are promising for advanced water treatment but often face trade&#8208;offs between permeability, stability, and catalytic efficiency. Here, the hierarchical architecture of collagen fiber networks (CFNs) is exploited to develop robust, efficient, and sustainable collagen&#8208;derived NCMs. Mechanical nanofibrillation and tannic acid (TA) functionalization generate highly dispersed fibrils and interconnected nanochannels that enhance water transport and active&#8208;site accessibility. TA further directs mineralization of Fe3O4 nanocatalysts and accelerates H2O2 activation, while the hierarchical porous structure promotes efficient utilization of reactive oxygen species. The resulting TA/Fe@CFN membranes exhibit high water permeance (2274.8 LMH bar&#8722;1) and achieve 98.2% tetracycline removal under flow&#8208;through conditions, along with efficient removal of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and genes in real medical wastewater. Mechanistic studies reveal that nanoconfinement is vital to the accelerated catalytic kinetics and enhanced Fenton activity. Life cycle and economic analyses further demonstrate that TA/Fe@CFN is a green and cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional polymeric membranes. This work establishes a high&#8208;performance, environmentally compatible platform for wastewater purification and highlights the broad potential of upcycling animal byproducts into multifunctional materials for circular water technologies.

         <title>Twisting van der Waals Heterostructures Enables Thermographic In&#8208;Sensor Computing and Logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired twisted graphene/TiSe2 heterostructures enable wide&#8208;range thermal perception (20&#8211;350 K). Integrated into a 64 &#215; 64 array with CNN, they enhance thermal imaging accuracy by 46% and achieve 99% pathological cell classification, while demonstrating in&#8208;sensor logic operations toward intelligent machine vision.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing and logics are the core for advancing machine vision technology, but face challenges in extending such capability into thermal form. Here, a bioinspired thermoreceptor array based on twisted graphene and titanium diselenide (TiSe2) heterostructures is presented. The electron&#8208;phonon interaction between graphene and few&#8208;layer TiSe2 exhibits strong twist&#8208;angle (&#952;) dependence, as evidenced by varied phonon&#8208;induced gap of graphene (114 &#177; 13 meV for &#952; = 1&#176; and 67 &#177; 6 meV for &#952; = 7&#176;), enabling sensitive thermal reception at temperature range from 20 to 350 K. Integrating such heterostructure into a (64 &#215; 64) thermoperception array with a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework promotes significant advancements in microscopic thermal imaging, enhancing thermal image detection accuracy by 46% and achieving 99% classification accuracy for pathological cell identification. In addition, the &#8220;AND&#8221; &#8220;OR&#8221;, and,&#8220;AND/OR&#8221; logic operations are demonstrated using these thermoreceptor arrays. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermoperception arrays also simplify the monolithically integrable architecture of machine vision and offer a potential solution for efficient in&#8208;sensor computing and logics for next&#8208;generation intelligent systems.

         <title>Designing Synergistic Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs in Compressed Bismuth&#8208;Copper Oxide for Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive lattice strain strengthens synergistic Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (Bi&#8211;VO&#8211;Cu) in a bimetallic oxide catalyst via metal&#8208;oxygen bond contraction, optimizing the electronic structure for selective CO2 reduction. The strain&#8208;engineered catalyst achieves stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion with &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency across industrial current densities and outstanding operational stability over 120 h, offering a general design principle for atomic&#8208;scale catalytic systems.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) to formate represents a sustainable pathway for carbon utilization, yet its industrial deployment remains hindered by insufficient current density and stability of the electrocatalysts. While lattice strain engineering can modulate catalytic performance by altering electronic structures, a major challenge is the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding connecting the induced strain to the activity enhancement. Herein, by precisely engineering lattice strain in an atomically integrated catalytic system, we establish a definitive intrinsic structure&#8208;activity relationship, moving beyond conventional correlations with apparent properties. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that compressive strain effectively modulates the electronic structure of the Cu d&#8208;orbital and the local electronic states of oxygen vacancies, thereby enhancing the cooperation within the Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs. This mechanism facilitates CO2 adsorption and activation, stabilizes the key *HCOO intermediate, and significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency (&gt;95%) over a broad current density range (&#8722;100 to &#8722;700 mA cm&#8722;2), achieving 96.1% at &#8722;576.8 mA cm&#8722;2. This research not only elucidates the synergistic Lewis acid&#8208;base catalytic mechanism at the molecular level but also provides universal design principles for the sustainable electro&#8208;synthesis of value&#8208;added formate.

         <title>Solar Energy Storage in Polyoxometalate for On&#8208;Demand Hydrogen Transportation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under sunlight irradiation, the semiconductor can transfer photogenerated electrons to polyoxometalates, enabling a unique system that achieves spatiotemporal separation of light absorption, electron storage, and on&#8208;demand hydrogen production.








ABSTRACT
Widespread application of solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is hindered by critical limitations: the inherent safety risks of high&#8208;pressure H2 storage/transport, and the intermittent nature of solar energy. To address these challenges, we develop a solar energy storage and on&#8208;demand hydrogen production system by synergistically integrating commercial polyoxometalate (NH4)6H2W12O40 (W12) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). This system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in storing solar energy as electrons within W12 during illumination. These stored electrons can be released on demand in the dark through Pt/C activation to produce H2, achieving a highly efficient hydrogen evolution rate of 3220&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under dark photocatalytic conditions. Notably, the system maintains robust performance under real&#8208;world conditions, delivering an outdoor hydrogen evolution rate of 954&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight irradiation. Detailed analysis reveals an optimized electron storage&#8208;release pathway, facilitated by the favorable alignment between the reduction potential of W12 and the band structure of g&#8208;C3N4, as well as the electrostatic self&#8208;assembly driven by oppositely charged g&#8208;C3N4 and W12. In this system, solar energy is facilely stored as stabilized electrons within the POM&#8208;semiconductor suspension, which can then be efficiently transported to light&#8208;deficient environments and controllably released for on&#8208;demand hydrogen evolution.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Regulation via a Volatile Morphology Director Enables Trap&#8208;Suppressed Organic Solar Cells with 20.6% Efficiency</title>

It is introduced 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;iodobenzene (DBI) as a volatile solid additive with multiple noncovalent interactions to concurrently optimize both donor and acceptor phases. As validated by PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F ternary system, adding an optimal amount of DBI achieves a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.6% with a boosted operational stability (T80:769&#160;h) under continuous light&#8208;soaking condition.








Abstract
Immense trap densities arising from faint donor self&#8208;assembly and excessive acceptor aggregation severely restrain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells. Yet, most studies focus solely on acceptor regulation, and synergistic co&#8208;modulation of donor and acceptor phases for trap suppression has rarely been achieved. Here, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;iodobenzene (DBI) as a volatile solid additive with multiple noncovalent interactions to concurrently optimize both phases is introduced. Using PM6:Y6 as representative, from systemic coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulation, in&#8208;situ synchronic and spectroscopy and transient optoelectronic characterizations, it is demonstrated that DBI can selectively bind with the fluorinated benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene segments in PM6 backbone, which strengthens interchain interactions, enhances interchain packing density, and triggers the pre&#8208;aggregation of PM6 in solution state. Moreover, this preferentially precipitation of PM6 matrix sterically mitigates the oversized Y6 aggregation, which yields well&#8208;defined phase separation with appropriate domain sizes, which markedly substitute energetic disorder and trap density. As a result, the DBI treated devices yielded an elevated performance of 18.4% compared to 17.0% for reference devices. The generality of such strategy is also validated by PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F ternary system, where adding an optimal amount of DBI achieves a champion PCE of 20.6% with a boosted operational stability (T80:769&#160;h) under continuous light&#8208;soaking condition.

         <title>3D Chiral Perovskitoid&#8208;to&#8208;Perovskite Reconstructive Phase Transition Designed Molecular Ferroelectric Thin&#8208;Film with out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization</title>

         <dc:description>
3D chiral R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 (AQ = 3&#8208;aminoquinolinium) ferroelectric thin films with preferred (00l) orientation can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the (00l) preferential orientation. This rearrangement triggers chiral AQ2+ cation reorientation within the lattice, successfully switching polarization direction of the thin&#8208;film from pure in&#8208;plane to pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane.








Abstract
The realization of pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in ferroelectric thin films is crucial for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance microelectronics and miniaturized devices. Molecular ferroelectrics, which allow facile and large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film fabrication via solution processing, have gained tremendous attention in recent years. However, to date, molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization have never been reported due to the inconsistency of their random orientation with the polarization direction. Herein, 3D chiral alkali metal halide ferroelectrics R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 (AQ = 3&#8208;aminoquinolinium) are designed, of which thin films exhibit a highly preferred (00l) orientation. Notably, R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the thin films with the (00l) preferential orientation. More importantly, such a topological rearrangement of the 3D inorganic [CsI3]n2&#8722; framework triggers chiral AQ2+ cation reorientation in the lattice, which changes the polarization direction from b&#8208;axis in the polar perovskitoid phase to c&#8208;axis in the perovskite phase, enabling the variation from pure in&#8208;plane to pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in the thin&#8208;film. To the knowledge, this is the first report of molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. This work opens up an avenue for achieving pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in molecular ferroelectric thin films.

Herein, 3D chiral alkali metal halide ferroelectrics &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-AQCsI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (AQ = 3-aminoquinolinium) are designed, of which thin films exhibit a highly preferred (00&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;) orientation. Notably, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-AQCsI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the thin films with the (00&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;) preferential orientation. More importantly, such a topological rearrangement of the 3D inorganic [CsI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; framework triggers chiral AQ&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation reorientation in the lattice, which changes the polarization direction from &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-axis in the polar perovskitoid phase to &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-axis in the perovskite phase, enabling the variation from pure in-plane to pure out-of-plane polarization in the thin-film. To the knowledge, this is the first report of molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out-of-plane polarization. This work opens up an avenue for achieving pure out-of-plane polarization in molecular ferroelectric thin films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Utilization of Diamagnetic Force Introduced by External Magnetic Fields for Printing Scalable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of photoactive film morphology is crucial for scalable organic solar cells. This study introduces a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted printing strategy to enhance the intermolecular interactions and guide molecular stacking. This method improves film homogeneity, minimizes defects, and reduces performance loss, offering a universal approach for printing high&#8208;quality photoactive films and multi&#8208;parameter optimization in organic electronics.









Abstract
The photovoltaic performance and stability of scalable organic solar cells (OSCs) are significantly governed by the micromorphology, molecular interactions, and stacking behavior of the active layer. As the device area increases, these effects are amplified, making long&#8208;range morphological control of small&#8208;molecule acceptors challenging and frequently leading to performance degradation. Herein, a non&#8208;contact and size&#8208;insensitive magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted printing strategy is developed, which modulates the chemical environment of molecular end groups during film formation and enhances intermolecular interactions, thereby regulating the molecular stacking behavior. These collectively improve the film homogeneity, reduce the defect density, and minimize the performance loss in large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the optimal pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction OSCs, fabricated via air atmosphere printing, achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.23%. Furthermore, large&#8208;area binary modules with an aperture area of 25.00 cm2 retain an optimized PCE of 16.70%, underscoring their strong potential for scalable production. Overall, this work proposes a universal approach for printing high&#8208;quality photoactive films and provides a valuable framework for the collaborative optimization of organic electronic devices.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Complex Acceptor Modulating Dielectric Constant and Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Suppressed Energy Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;complex&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (PtHD) is developed, featuring enhanced planarity and rigidity that suppress exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. Pt coordination increases the dipole moment and polarizability, boosting the dielectric constant. The resulting D18/L8&#8208;BO:PtHD ternary device achieves reduced energy loss (Eloss) and efficient exciton dissociation, delivering a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.52%.








Abstract
Excessive energy loss (Eloss) remains a primary bottleneck limiting further efficiency improvements in organic solar cells (OSCs). Mitigating energy losses is therefore a key prerequisite for advancing organic photovoltaic technologies. Rational acceptor molecular design that modulates the dielectric constant and exciton&#8208;vibration coupling of the active layer has emerged as a particularly promising route to achieving this goal. Herein, a platinum&#8208;complex&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (PtHD) is designed and synthesized. The molecule features high planarity and backbone rigidity, which effectively suppresses exciton&#8208;vibration coupling. Integrating the Pt coordination unit amplifies the molecular dipole moment and polarizability, consequently enhancing the dielectric constant of the active layer. A binary device based on D18/PtHD achieves a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.938&#160;V with a reduced Eloss of 0.525&#160;eV. Building on this achievement, by introducing PtHD as a guest component into the D18/L8&#8208;BO system and employing a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition strategy to control the vertical distribution, the ternary device demonstrates an minimized Eloss and superior exciton separation, culminating in a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.52%. This work highlights the crucial role of metal&#8208;complex acceptors in managing energy loss and charge dynamics, thus providing a molecular design paradigm to develop highly efficient organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthetic Machinery for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system that integrates carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a CuZn nanozyme photosensitizer with a dendritic polymer (PPA) is constructed for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The PPA&#8208;wrapped CA/CuZn can capture CO2 to form active intermediates. Through photo&#8208;induced charge transfer under visible light illumination, the CA/CuZn@PPA system achieves 100% selectivity for DMC production at room temperature and low CO2 pressure.








ABSTRACT
Producing value&#8208;added chemicals directly from CO2 powered by sunlight offers a sustainable approach to addressing both environmental and economic challenges. However, the inherent chemical stability of CO2 poses a grand challenge in achieving highly active and selective CO2 conversion. Herein, we develop a biohybrid semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system that integrates carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a CuZn nanozyme photosensitizer with a dendritic polymer (PPA) for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The PPA&#8208;wrapped CA/CuZn can capture CO2 to form active intermediates. Through photo&#8208;induced charge transfer under visible light illumination, the CA/CuZn@PPA system achieves 100% selectivity for DMC production at room temperature and low CO2 pressure.

         <title>Multi&#8208;scale Engineered Vasculature and Hierarchical Porosity via Volumetric Bioprinting&#8208;Guided Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vascularization in bioprinted hydrogels is limited by nanoscale porosity in hydrogel bionks. Volumetric bioprinting of gelatin&#8211;norbornene phase&#8208;separating hydrogels permits to create centimeter&#8208;scale constructs featuring interconnected multi&#8208;scale porosity. Light dose gradients result in spatially controlled pore dimensions. Capillary&#8208;scale vessels are grown from bioprinted endothelial cells, and printed channels can be perfused, enabling the biofabrication of perfusable tissue models.








Abstract
Vascularization remains a major challenge in hydrogel&#8208;based engineered tissues due to the inherent nano&#8208;scale porosity of common synthetic and natural biomaterials. Critically, the confinement imposed by nanoscale networks inhibits blood vessels outgrowth, required for oxygen and nutrient delivery. Despite advancements in the biofabrication of small channels (0.1&#8211;1 mm), achieving vascularization (with capillaries down to 10 &#181;m) throughout cm&#8208;scale bioprinted constructs remains a critical bottleneck. Herein, phase separating is integrated, cell&#8211;interactive gelatin&#8211;norbornene hydrogels with volumetric bioprinting to generate architecturally defined centimeter&#8208;scale constructs with 0.1&#8211;1mm scale printed channels and interpenetrating micron&#8208;scale porosity. This novel approach produced freeform construct designs with light&#8208;controllable micron&#8208;scale and hierarchical porosity. Importantly, this porosity enabled endothelial cell infiltration and microvessel outgrowth deep into the engineered tissue. Vascular structures formed in the pore spaces with feature sizes on the scale of capillaries (&lt;10 &#181;m), crucial to provide oxygen and nutrients to all regions of the hydrogel. The networks remained stable for over 14 days, outperforming classical nanoporous biomaterials. Vascular networks are perfusable in this custom&#8208;made bioreactor system and exhibited extended vessel outgrowth under perfused culture conditions. These complex hydrogel&#8208;based constructs with engineered multi&#8208;scale vascular networks have potential for generating actively perfusable advanced tissue models.

         <title>Gradient&#8208;Acceptor&#8208;Doping Breaks the Piezoelectric Trade&#8208;Off in Lead&#8208;Free (K, Na)NbO3 Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient&#8208;acceptor&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to fundamentally break the long&#8208;standing compromise between piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and mechanical quality factor (Qm) in (K, Na)NbO3 ferroelectric ceramics. By creating a controlled compositional gradient of Cu2+ ions in soft (K, Na)NbO3 ceramics via solid&#8208;state diffusion sintering, a record&#8208;breaking combination of d33 = 350 pC/N and Qm = 340 is obtained, promising for high&#8208;power piezoelectric applications.








Abstract
Achieving a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and a high mechanical quality factor (Qm) simultaneously in ferroelectric ceramics has been a persistent challenge, as conventional doping strategies, i.e., donor doping and acceptor doping, inevitably sacrifice one for the other. Here, the inherent trade&#8208;off is breaking through a new gradient&#8208;acceptor&#8208;doping strategy. By judiciously introducing gradient Cu2+&#8208;acceptor ions in &#8220;soft&#8221; (K, Na)NbO3 (KNN) ceramics, a record combination of properties is achieved &#8212; a d33 of 350 pC/N and a Qm of 340,&#8212;the first co&#8208;elevation of both parameters exceeding 300 in KNN&#8208;based systems. This represents a fourfold improvement in Qm with only a 10% reduction in d33. Multi&#8208;scale structural analysis reveals that the gradient doping retains a &#8220;soft&#8221; interior for high d33, and creates a &#8220;hardened&#8221; surface layer that effectively restrains domain switching, accounting for the enhanced Qm. This work offers a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;power ferroelectric ceramics by spatially tailoring functional properties.

         <title>Durable Natural Urine Electrolysis Enabled by Lewis Acid&#8208;Tailored Interfacial Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Lewis acid (LA)&#8208;tailored interfacial microenvironment strategy is proposed to engineer V2O5&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Ni2P catalyst, which selectively enriches interfacial OH&#8722; while suppressing the adsorption of Cl&#8722; impurities and the generation of N&#8208;chlorourea in urine, thereby enabling durable natural urine oxidation reaction. An industrial electrolyser assembled with this catalyst demonstrated &#8776;0.5&#160;kW&#8208;level electrolysis of natural urine and wheatfield effluents for the first time.








Abstract
Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising alternative to sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production. However, its reliance on costly pure urea limits practical application. To address this issue, urine oxidation reaction (UrOR) has been proposed, which utilizes natural urine as a cost&#8208;free feedstock. Nevertheless, due to the complex ionic matrix of urine, UrOR suffers from catalyst acidification and chloride&#8208;induced corrosion, limiting long&#8208;term stability. Here, an interfacial microenvironment regulation strategy by modifying common Ni2P catalyst with various hard Lewis acids (LA) is reported. The optimal V2O5&#8208;&#948;&#8208;Ni2P hybrid exhibits remarkable UrOR activity (1.62&#160;V at 3&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term durability (1000&#160;h). Mechanistic analysis reveals that LA component selectively enriches interfacial OH&#8722; ions, effectively suppressing the adsorption of impurities, especially Cl&#8722; ions, and the generation of N&#8208;chlorourea byproduct. Notably, a near&#8208;kilowatt&#8208;scale natural urine electrolysis is first verified in a flow electrolyser (18 cells, area of 1386&#160;cm2), achieving a high H2 production rate of 115.84&#160;L&#160;h&#8722;1 with a urine purification rate of 97.41%, while recovering nitrogen&#8208;rich compound fertilizers (NH4Cl/KCl). Furthermore, the electrolyzer exhibits broad applicability across wastewater with various urea concentrations (5&#8211;330&#160;mM) and Cl&#8722; ions concentrations (0.5&#8208;500&#160;mM), including challenging 100 L wheatfield effluents.

         <title>Covalent Dangling of Poly&#8208;Indium&#8208;Phthalocyanine Over Carbon Nanopits as Superior Oxygen Reduction Catalyst for Flexible Zn&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalently dangled poly&#8208;In&#8208;phthalocyanine on defective carbon nanotubes distorts In&#8211;N4 symmetry via axial In&#8211;C coordination while enhancing metal&#8208;support interactions. Theoretical calculations confirm this design facilitates O2 activation while lowering *OH desorption barriers, thus yielding excellent ORR activity. Applied to Zn&#8208;air batteries, it delivers 270 mW cm&#8722;2 power density and 865 h stability at 5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) represents&#160;a cornerstone in renewable energy technologies such as Zn&#8211;air batteries, yet its sluggish kinetics and reliance on noble metal catalysts remain critical bottlenecks. Here, we report an ingenious catalyst configured by covalently dangling poly&#8208;indium&#8208;phthalocyanine onto carbon nanopit defects in carbon nanotubes (InPPc/v&#8208;CNTs). This architecture induces axial In&#8211;C coordination that disrupts the symmetric electron distribution of the planar In&#8211;N4 center and strengthens electronic metal&#8211;support interactions. Theoretical calculations reveal that this distorted electronic environment enhances O2 adsorption/dissociation kinetics while weakening the *OH desorption energy barrier, thereby synergistically boosting ORR kinetics. Benefiting from the tailored electronic structure and optimized metal&#8211;support configuration, InPPc/v&#8208;CNTs exhibits both superb ORR activity and stability, with a half&#8208;wave potential up to 0.90 V vs RHE and a kinetic current density of 42.9 mA cm&#8722;2 (&gt;10&#8208;fold higher than the Pt/C benchmark). Moreover, in aqueous Zn&#8211;air batteries, it delivers a remarkable power density of 270 mW cm&#8722;2 and a discharge stability up to 865 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. This work transcends conventional catalyst design by unifying defect engineering, electronic asymmetry, and macromolecular stabilization into a cohesive framework, establishing a new paradigm for metal phthalocyanine&#8208;based ORR catalysts.

         <title>Metabolic Osteoimmune Biodegradable Zn&#8211;Mn Alloys: High Strength&#8208;Ductility and In Situ Vascular&#8208;Osteogenic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strengthening&#8208;efficiency (high&#8208;SE) design strategy is proposed to develop novel Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg and Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Li alloys, which achieve the highest SE among Zn alloys with yield strength &gt;350 MPa and elongation &gt;30%. This work unveils their strengthening&#8208;ductilization mechanism and an immunomodulatory&#8208;anti&#8208;inflammatory&#8208;metabolic osteogenic coupling cascade, providing a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation orthopedic implants.








Abstract
Driven by the demand for sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective medical materials, design of biodegradable metals increasingly aims to achieve higher strength and biofunctionality with less alloying. This study proposes a high strengthening&#8208;efficiency (high&#8208;SE) design strategy and develops novel Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg and Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Li alloys. With total alloying additions below 1 wt.%, these alloys achieve yield strength of 369&#8211;397 MPa, elongation of 42&#8211;57%, and remarkable strengthening efficiency (SE) of 6.4&#8211;6.8. These SE values represent the highest level among high strength&#8208;ductile Zn alloys (YS &gt; 300 MPa, EL &gt; 40%). Benefiting from the synergistic release of Zn2+, Mn2+, and Li+/Mg2+ ions, both the alloys exhibit superior antibacterial activity, cytocompatibility, controlled degradation rates, and in vivo osteogenesis, demonstrating excellent degradation&#8208;osteogenesis coupling effect. Notably, Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg further enhances osteogenesis by activating the PI3K/Akt/HIF&#8208;1&#945; signaling axis, which coordinates cascades of immunomodulation (e.g., IGF2, P2rx5), anti&#8208;inflammation (e.g., Nfkbia inhibition), and cellular energy metabolism (e.g., Ndufaf3), resulting in a more pronounced osteogenic effect. This work establishes a new paradigm for high&#8208;efficiency alloy design, achieving simultaneous breakthroughs in mechanical and biofunctionality, offering a promising framework for next&#8208;generation Zn&#8208;based orthopedic implants.

&lt;p&gt;A high-strengthening-efficiency (high-SE) design strategy is proposed to develop novel Zn-0.8Mn-0.1Mg and Zn-0.8Mn-0.1Li alloys, which achieve the highest SE among Zn alloys with yield strength &amp;gt;350 MPa and elongation &amp;gt;30%.

         <title>Lattice Distortion in High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Diselenide for Augmented Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the lattice distortion effect, this study for the first time realize a unique distortion of the trigonal prismatic motif in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This distorted lattice generates electron accumulation regions that serve as highly active sites, significantly enhancing the basal plane activity of TMDs for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy strategy offers a viable pathway to activate the inert basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates that the &#8220;lattice distortion effect&#8221;, one of the core effects of high&#8208;entropy materials, plays a crucial role in activating the basal plane of TMDs. A high&#8208;entropy diselenide (ReNbTaMoW)Se2 (denoted as HESe2) is synthesized via solid&#8208;state reaction. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a unique fivefold&#8208;modulated structure in HESe2, which unexpectedly distorts the rigid trigonal prismatic motif. HESe2 exhibits exceptional activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), showing a low overpotential of 31&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art precious metal catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the distorted structure of HESe2 remains stable during the HER process. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser assembled with HESe2 cathodic catalyst shows competitive performance and durability with negligible degradation over 400 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electron accumulation regions induced by lattice distortion as high&#8208;activity sites, thereby driving the augmented HER performance of HESe2. This work presents a universal strategy for boosting the basal plane activity of layered materials through unique lattice distortion effect.

         <title>Thermally Drawn Multifunctional All&#8208;Hydrogel Fibers for Anti&#8208;Fibrotic and Multimodal Neural Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels demonstrate material properties that mimic the mechanical and chemical environments of biological tissues. Yet, they face challenges during their integration into 3D interfaces. By identifying a class of thermoplastic hydrogels, a strategy is developed to pattern hydrogels in thermally drawn fibers. Composed of functional hydrogels, these fibers act as a platform for multimodal interfacing and antifibrotic interaction with neural tissue.








Abstract
Hydrogels have emerged as promising materials for anti&#8208;fibrotic neural interfaces due to their mechanical and chemical similarity to biological tissue. However, their use in multimodal platforms remains limited, owing to fabrication challenges in microstructuring multiple functional hydrogels into compact architectures. Here, a hydrogel thermal drawing process (HG&#8208;TDP) is presented that enables the co&#8208;fabrication of multiple thermoplastically deformable hydrogels into a single, compact, and multifunctional fiber. By optimizing key process parameters, all&#8208;hydrogel neural interfaces are developed that minimize gliosis through tissue&#8208;like mechanical compliance and enable post&#8208;implantation anti&#8208;inflammatory drug delivery via the hydrogel&#8208;based matrix. These fibers feature the compact integration of diverse hydrogel components, including a step&#8208;index optical waveguide, an electrically conductive hydrogel electrode, and a hydrogel&#8208;based microfluidic channel within a unified fiber structure. This integration enables multimodal neural interfacing, as demonstrated by high&#8208;quality neural signal recording, optogenetic stimulation, and localized chemical modulation of neural circuits. This work offers a scalable route toward compact, fully hydrogel&#8208;based neural interfaces that combine multimodal functionality with tissue&#8208;friendly, anti&#8208;fibrotic properties.

         <title>Engineering Glucose&#8208;Responsive Insulin Granules with High&#8208;Payload for Long&#8208;Acting Glycemic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the significant potential of high&#8208;payload, physiologically responsive delivery systems in diabetes management, which also offers a promising strategy for developing intelligent for protein&#8208;based therapeutics, advancing more precise, safe, and patient&#8208;compliant treatments.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;payload systems that dynamically respond to physiological fluctuations is crucial not only for improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of protein therapies but also for addressing biosafety concerns associated with carriers, reducing administration frequency, minimizing infection risks, and enhancing patient compliance. However, achieving precise control over protein release in the high&#8208;payload carriers remain a major challenge. In this study, a physiology&#8208;responsive, high&#8208;payload insulin (Ins) granule is engineered for long&#8208;term glucose management, using Ins as a model&#8212;an essential hormone that must be released in response to blood glucose changes for effective glycemic control in diabetic patients. The [(Ins&amp;GOx)@Zn]@[TA&amp;Fe] granules achieve an Ins loading capacity (LC%) exceeding 80%, significantly higher than the previously reported maximum of &#8776;40%. These granules extend the glucose&#8208;regulating effect of free Ins, typically limited to 3&#160;h, to 6&#160;days with a single injection, without any observed risk of hypoglycemia. Long&#8208;term administration (28&#160;days, 4 injection cycles, 7&#160;days&#160;injection&#8722;1) shows no significant physiological toxicity or immune response. This approach offers a promising strategy for developing intelligent, high&#8208;payload delivery systems for protein&#8208;based therapeutics, advancing more precise, safe, and patient&#8208;compliant treatments.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Self&#8208;Encrypted Interlock&#8208;Cascade&#8208;Hashing Optical Storage Based on Multicolor Photochromic Lithographic Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing lithography and mask patterning, on&#8208;chip arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal self&#8208;encrypted optical information storage and interlock&#8208;cascade&#8208;hashing encryption. This work holds significant promise for advancing anti&#8208;cloning and anti&#8208;cracking technologies for high&#8208;value devices, assets, and information.








Abstract
Continuing deve7lopments in artificial intelligence and quantum computing challenge the information security of physical assets and intellectual property. Photochromic materials have emerged as promising candidates for optical encryption and storage applications due to their intrinsic reversible, real&#8208;time light absorption modulation capability. Although all&#8208;inorganic devices exhibit pronounced stability and fatigue resistance, single&#8208;component multicolor photochromic systems remain exceedingly rare. Here, a multicolor photochromic phenomenon is reported in PbMoO4 microcrystal, demonstrating both volatility and non&#8208;volatility through distinct photochromic channels. The input, output, and control signals of this material are all different wavelengths of light, which operate in an all&#8208;optical and non&#8208;destructive manner. Moreover, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state nature of PbMoO4 ensures its stable modulation capability after multiple photoresponse cycles with upconversion luminescence modulation up to 99%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing deve7lopments in artificial intelligence and quantum computing challenge the information security of physical assets and intellectual property. Photochromic materials have emerged as promising candidates for optical encryption and storage applications due to their intrinsic reversible, real-time light absorption modulation capability. Although all-inorganic devices exhibit pronounced stability and fatigue resistance, single-component multicolor photochromic systems remain exceedingly rare. Here, a multicolor photochromic phenomenon is reported in PbMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; microcrystal, demonstrating both volatility and non-volatility through distinct photochromic channels. The input, output, and control signals of this material are all different wavelengths of light, which operate in an all-optical and non-destructive manner. Moreover, the all-solid-state nature of PbMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ensures its stable modulation capability after multiple photoresponse cycles with upconversion luminescence modulation up to 99%. By combining experimental characterizations with ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, the mechanisms of each photochromic channel are revealed. Employing lithography and mask patterning, on-chip arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the feasibility of spatiotemporal self-encrypted optical information storage and interlock-cascade-hashing encryption. This work holds significant promise for advancing anti-cloning and anti-cracking technologies for high-value devices, assets, and information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Remorphable Architectures: Reprogramming Global Bistability through Locally Bistable Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local bistable reconfiguration in mechanical metamaterials is leveraged in globally bistable architectures to enable in situ reprogrammable transition pathways through state flip of individual building blocks. The local&#8208;to&#8208;global correspondence of instabilities empowers soft robotic systems with on&#8208;demand morphing traits, as well as aerospace structures with switchable, reconfigurable pathways.








Abstract
Bistability enables a physical system to reversibly transition between two stable states via snapping instability, and is broadly classified as either global&#8211;facilitating macroscopic shape morphing of a structure&#8211;or local, which enables internal geometric reconfiguration within a metamaterial. In existing metamaterials and structures, each form of bistability is implemented independently from the other, failing to capitalize on the benefits that their interaction can offer. In this work, locally bistable metamaterials are integrated into a globally bistable structure, enabling reprogrammable global bistability. By selectively transitioning local unit cells of the metamaterial into a self&#8208;contact state, a specific combination of soft hinges is encoded into the global structure. The encoded hinges can significantly alter the global kinematics of the structure, allowing reprogrammable triggering force, snapping trajectory, and energy barrier. Distinct combinations of local hinges are shown to enable a metamaterial arch to deliver multi&#8208;target actuation, a linkage to switch seamlessly between multistable, bistable, and monostable states, and a dome to transform into various curved shapes. The local&#8208;to&#8208;global interplay unveiled in this work can be leveraged to design multi&#8208;modal jumping/leaping robots and space structures capable of dynamically adjusting their actuation and morphing modes by simply flipping the local states of their unit&#160;cells.

         <title>Cobalt&#8208;Bridged Polyoxoniobate Framework for High Reversibility and Capacity Retention Polysulfide Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel inorganic cobalt&#8208;bridged polyoxoniobate framework (Co&#8208;PONbs) featuring a 3D topological network is constructed via coordinative linkage of {PNb12O40} clusters. This unique architecture creates asymmetric dual&#8208;active sites that drive efficient polysulfide conversion through a cooperative electron&#8208;transfer mechanism. When applied in a polysulfide&#8208;iodine redox flow battery, it enables an unprecedented cycling stability with 99.96% capacity retention over 1500 cycles at 60 mA cm&#8722;2.








ABSTRACT
In this work, we report for the first time a cobalt&#8208;bridged polyoxoniobate framework (Co&#8208;PONbs) featuring a 3D coordination architecture, constructed by linking {PNb12O40} clusters through the coordinatively versatile Co2+ ions. This unique inorganic framework exhibits exceptional stability in strongly alkaline electrolytes, helping to address the challenge of catalyst degradation under operating conditions. Acting as an efficient electrocatalyst, Co&#8208;PONbs significantly enhances the redox conversion kinetics of polysulfides in redox flow batteries. Electrochemical in situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the preferential adsorption of polysulfides on Co&#8208;PONbs/SP&#8208;modified electrodes. First&#8208;principles calculations demonstrate that embedding cobalt centers in {PNb12O40} clusters generates asymmetric dual&#8208;active sites. This unique configuration drives S&#9472;S bond cleavage in S42&#8722; via a cooperative electron&#8208;transfer mechanism, kinetically promoting conversion to S22&#8722; intermediates. When implemented in aqueous polysulfide&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries, the Co&#8208;PONbs/SP composite&#8208;modified carbon felt cathode sustains remarkable energy efficiency (82.7%) and Coulombic efficiency (99.5%) over 530 h of continuous operation. The system demonstrates unprecedented cycling stability with 99.96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Construction of Robust and Criss&#8208;Crossed LiOH Nanosheets on Lithium Metal Anodes for Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface layer of uniform, ultrathin, robust, criss&#8208;crossed, and lithiophilic LiOH nanosheets is in situ constructed on Li metal anode by using a bond water chemistry in C2H8N2&#183;H2O. The LiOH interface layer can suppress the growth of Li dendrites and improve the stability of Li metal anode, resulting in a superior performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li) is a promising anode for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries due to its low potential, high theoretical capacity, and low density. However, issues including high chemical reactivity, unstable solid electrolyte interface, and formation of Li dendrites impede its application. Herein, an interface layer of uniform, ultrathin, robust, criss&#8208;crossed, and lithiophilic LiOH nanosheets is in situ constructed on Li metal anode by a bond water chemistry in C2H8N2&#183;H2O. Li deposition happens below the LiOH layer due to its ultralow electrical conductivity and abundant ion channels, which protects Li metal anode from corrosion by liquid electrolyte. The robust (14 GPa) and criss&#8208;crossed LiOH nanosheets can physically suppress the growth of Li dendrites. The LiOH layer with lithiophilicity can homogenize Li+ flux distribution and reduce Li+ diffusion barrier on interface, promoting uniform Li deposition. Under the regulation of the multifunctional LiOH layer, issues of Li metal anode are relieved. When used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, the C2H8N2&#183;H2O modified Li (MLi) can withstand the attack of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Thus, the electrochemical performances of Li metal anodes and Li&#8211;S batteries are obviously improved. This study provides a new inspiration for the interface modification of Li metal anodes.

         <title>Molecular Surface Engineering of Sulfide Electrolytes with Enhanced Humidity Tolerance for Robust Lithium Metal All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the electrochemical, interfacial, and humidity stability of halide&#8208;doped sulfide electrolytes (LPSClBr) is significantly enhanced by an organic surface coating using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li&#8208;OPA). This single&#8208;step strategy enables robust interfacial protection, supports lithium metal anodes, and improves long&#8208;term performance in high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including anode&#8208;free configurations.









Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) enable next&#8208;generation batteries due to their intrinsic safety and compatibility with lithium (Li) metal anodes. However, many SSEs, particularly sulfide&#8208;based systems, suffer from limited electrochemical stability and high moisture sensitivity. Here, the molecular surface engineering of Li argyrodite SSE, Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 (LPSClBr), is reported using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li&#8208;OPA) in a single&#8208;step coating strategy to stabilize both anode and cathode interfaces. The Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;coated electrolyte maintains high ionic conductivity (&gt;2.5&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1) and retains &gt;92% of its initial conductivity after 24&#160;h dry room exposure (dew point &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C). At 2&#160;wt.% loading, Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;coated LPSClBr achieves a critical current density of 2.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;1 and supports stable Li plating/stripping for over 400&#160;h at 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. In NCM811 cathode&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells, it delivers 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#160;C with &gt;99.7% Coulombic efficiency and 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In anode&#8208;free cell configurations, Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;modified electrolytes enhance interfacial stability and cycling performance.

&lt;p&gt;It is demonstrated that the electrochemical, interfacial, and humidity stability of halide-doped sulfide electrolytes (LPSClBr) is significantly enhanced by an organic surface coating using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li-OPA). This single-step strategy enables robust interfacial protection, supports lithium metal anodes, and improves long-term performance in high-voltage all-solid-state batteries, including anode-free configurations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) enable next-generation batteries due to their intrinsic safety and compatibility with lithium (Li) metal anodes. However, many SSEs, particularly sulfide-based systems, suffer from limited electrochemical stability and high moisture sensitivity. Here, the molecular surface engineering of Li argyrodite SSE, Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; (LPSClBr), is reported using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li-OPA) in a single-step coating strategy to stabilize both anode and cathode interfaces. The Li-OPA-coated electrolyte maintains high ionic conductivity (&amp;gt;2.5&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and retains &amp;gt;92% of its initial conductivity after 24&#160;h dry room exposure (dew point &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C). At 2&#160;wt.% loading, Li-OPA-coated LPSClBr achieves a critical current density of 2.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and supports stable Li plating/stripping for over 400&#160;h at 1.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In NCM811 cathode-based all-solid-state cells, it delivers 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.3&#160;C with &amp;gt;99.7% Coulombic efficiency and 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In anode-free cell configurations, Li-OPA-modified electrolytes enhance interfacial stability and cycling performance. These results demonstrate Li-OPA as a scalable, high-performance interfacial modifier for sulfide-based solid-state batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A frost&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting strategy (FFCS) is introduced to harness the thermodynamic frosting process, enabling polymer monomers to climb upward against gravity along growing frost crystals and form inverse fractal architectures via in situ photocuring. The resulting hierarchical super&#8208;surfaces, further integrated with nanomaterials, exhibit exceptional superhydrophobicity, photothermal efficiency, anti&#8208;icing performance, and light&#8208;healing functionality, offering a universal, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable route for advanced bio&#8208;inspired surface engineering.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;inspired super&#8208;surfaces with specific wettability and optical properties are highly valuable in various applications, while their direct and simple fabrication is still a challenge. Here, it is found that polymer monomers can climb upward against gravity along the frost crystals&#8217; structures during the thermodynamic frosting process. Its mechanism is revealed and thus a novel frost&#8208;assisted freeze&#8208;casting strategy (FFCS) for dynamically customizing micro&#8208;nanostructured super&#8208;surfaces is presented. These FFCS&#8208;derived super&#8208;surfaces with frost&#8208;crystals&#8208;like hierarchical structures are obtained directly by simply in situ photocrosslinking these monomers and removing the frost crystals. It has been proved that this innovative fabrication strategy via the thermodynamic frosting phase transition process is a general approach applicable to a wide range of materials. After the integration of nanomaterials, it has been demonstrated that the treated super&#8208;surfaces simultaneously exhibited extraordinary superhydrophobicity, outstanding photothermal conversion efficiency, impressive anti&#8208;icing ability, as well as light&#8208;healing superhydrophobicity and self&#8208;cleaning capabilities. It is believed that these new finding that harnesses the thermodynamic process of frosting to fabricate materials will bring inspiration and multifaceted impacts in a variety of scenarios.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Multicolor Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Phosphorescent Bionanocomposite Thin Films via Network&#8208;Confinement Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an efficient network&#8208;confinement coupling strategy to achieve stimuli&#8208;responsive multicolor nacre&#8208;mimetic phosphorescent bionanocomposite thin films via phosphorescence resonance energy transfer. The synergy of interlayer entanglement and structural nanoconfinement enables robust and tunable room temperature phosphorescence. The system displays dynamic, reversible water/heat stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and color&#8208;tunability, highlighting potential as water&#8208;soluble phosphorescent inks for multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and light&#8208;switchable information encryption applications.








Abstract
Dynamic room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials have garnered much attention for applications in anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption. However, developing dynamic bionanocomposite thin films (BTFs) featuring long&#8208;lived RTP emission remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an efficient and straightforward network&#8208;confinement coupling strategy is presented to create stimuli&#8208;responsive multicolor nacre&#8208;mimetic phosphorescent BTFs by embedding 3&#8208;amino&#8208;9&#8208;ethylcarbazole molecules into polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;entangled collagen molecules and assembling with tannic acid&#8208;mediated &#945;&#8208;zirconium phosphate nanoplatelets via phosphorescence resonance energy transfer. The structural nanoconfinement effects enabled by the nanoplatelets not only resulted in nacre&#8208;like brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar microstructure but also effectively suppressed the quenching effect from ambient oxygen, promoting RTP efficiency. Moreover, the RTP emission of the BTFs exhibited dynamic sensitivity to both water and heat stimuli owing to the disruption of the hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, leading to reversible RTP quenching. Importantly, the interlayer entanglement in the BTFs significantly enhanced the RTP performance, achieving an ultralong lifetime up to 1075.1 ms and an afterglow lasting 11.0 s. Furthermore, leveraging their stimuli&#8208;responsiveness and color&#8208;tunability, the BTFs&#8217; components are demonstrated as water&#8208;soluble phosphorescent inks to prepare multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and be applied for light&#8208;switchable information encryption. This work offers a promising strategy for rational design and development of stimuli&#8208;responsive multicolor materials for advanced functional applications.

ITO nanoparticles (INPs) with abundant &#9472;OH groups are introduced to promote the uniform self&#8208;assembly of SAM molecules in inverted PSCs. The assembly of SAM can also be reinforced due to the strongly bonded &#9472;OH groups on INPs, inhibiting its desorption during solvent rinsing and long&#8208;term aging. Resulting PSCs show high efficiency of 26.44% with good operational stability under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol, retaining, retaining &#8776;91% of initial efficiency after MPP tracking for 1000&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Recently, inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show rapidly improved efficiency with the use of self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAM). However, device stability remains a challenge due to the easy desorption of the SAM molecule. Here, functionalized indium tin oxide nanoparticles (INPs) are introduced to promote and reinforce the self&#8208;assembly of SAM on the substrate. INPs contain abundant &#9472;OH groups to uniformly anchor SAM molecules. Importantly, different from traditional physically absorbed and easy&#8208;desorbed &#9472;OH in ITO substrate, the &#9472;OH groups on INPs are stably bonded, resistant to solvent rinsing and long&#8208;term aging, thus inhibiting SAM desorption during device aging. As a result, PSCs with INPs exhibit high efficiency of 26.44% with good operational stability under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol, retaining &#8764;&#8776;91% of initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking with continuous illumination at 85&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Lattice&#8208;Distorted Mn&#8208;Based Catalysts Boosting High Energy&#8208;Efficiency Aqueous Metal&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>

In situ formation of lattice&#8208;distorted MnO2 via Mn2+&#8208;additive strategy breaks the oxygen reaction kinetics limitation in aqueous metal&#8208;air batteries with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This approach not only enables Mn&#8208;air batteries with ultralow overpotential (0.29&#160;V) and record&#8208;high energy efficiency (84.2%), but also delivers promising cycle life (&gt;1000&#160;h) for Zn&#8208;air batteries, paving the way for efficient, durable, and CO2&#8208;tolerant aqueous metal&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous metal&#8208;air batteries (AMABs) offer sustainable energy storage solutions with inherent safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high theoretical energy density. However, their practical performance is limited by sluggish oxygen redox kinetics, especially in CO2&#8208;tolerant and anode&#8208;friendly near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. Here, a feasible catalyst design strategy is reported by introducing Mn2+ into aqueous electrolytes to enable in situ formation of MnO2. Notably, this electrodeposited MnO2 exhibits a unique 3% lattice contraction, which upshifts the d&#8208;band center and significantly accelerates oxygen evolution reactions. The lattice distortion optimizes the *OOH intermediate formation energy, reducing the potential&#8208;determining step barrier by &#8776;17.0% compared to conventional MnO2. Consequently, Zn&#8208;air batteries with near&#8208;neutral electrolytes achieve a 35.9% reduction in OER/ORR overpotential (0.50&#160;V) and elongated cycling stability (&gt;1000&#160;h).

&lt;p&gt;In situ formation of lattice-distorted MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-additive strategy breaks the oxygen reaction kinetics limitation in aqueous metal-air batteries with near-neutral electrolytes. This approach not only enables Mn-air batteries with ultralow overpotential (0.29&#160;V) and record-high energy efficiency (84.2%), but also delivers promising cycle life (&amp;gt;1000&#160;h) for Zn-air batteries, paving the way for efficient, durable, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tolerant aqueous metal-air batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rechargeable aqueous metal-air batteries (AMABs) offer sustainable energy storage solutions with inherent safety, cost-effectiveness, and high theoretical energy density. However, their practical performance is limited by sluggish oxygen redox kinetics, especially in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tolerant and anode-friendly near-neutral electrolytes. Here, a feasible catalyst design strategy is reported by introducing Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into aqueous electrolytes to enable in situ formation of MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Notably, this electrodeposited MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits a unique 3% lattice contraction, which upshifts the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center and significantly accelerates oxygen evolution reactions. The lattice distortion optimizes the &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;OOH intermediate formation energy, reducing the potential-determining step barrier by &#8776;17.0% compared to conventional MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, Zn-air batteries with near-neutral electrolytes achieve a 35.9% reduction in OER/ORR overpotential (0.50&#160;V) and elongated cycling stability (&amp;gt;1000&#160;h). This approach further enables Mn-air batteries to achieve a low overpotential (0.29&#160;V) and high energy efficiency (84.2%), offering a universal strategy for efficient, durable, and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-tolerant AMABs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tuning Active Hydrogen via Spillover Enables the Wide&#8208;Potential Electrochemical Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen spillover strategy is reported using Pt/np&#8208;Co2P, where Pt&#8208;generated *H migrates to Co2P to promote *NO hydrogenation. This enables Faradaic efficiencies &gt;90% across a 600&#8208;mV potential window, approaches 100% at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and shows excellent adaptability to fluctuating power, highlighting a general route to optimize hydrogen activity for NO3RR.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a sustainable route for green ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions. However, achieving high NH3 selectivity across a broad potential window, which is crucial for integration with fluctuating renewable energy sources, remains challenging due to difficulties in precisely controlling the active hydrogen supply. Herein, a hydrogen spillover strategy is presented to address this challenge by optimizing hydrogen activity. This strategy is realized using a Pt nanoparticle decorated nanoporous Co2P (Pt/np&#8208;Co2P) catalyst. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, density functional theory calculations, and a suite of control experiments reveal that Pt nanoparticles generate active hydrogen, which migrates via the spillover pathway to hydrogenate *NO on Co2P. This process significantly lowers both thermodynamic and kinetic barriers for *NO hydrogenation. As a result, the Pt/np&#8208;Co2P catalyst maintains a Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% across a wide 600&#160;mV potential window by ensuring sufficient *H availability at low overpotentials and suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at high overpotentials. The FE approaches 100% at an industrially relevant current density of &#8776;1 A cm&#8722;2. Similar performance enhancements observed for other noble metal&#8211;decorated np&#8208;Co2P confirm the universality of hydrogen spillover strategy for designing efficient catalysts toward practical ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Photoswitchable Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescence With Large Stokes Shift From Dye&#8208;Encapsulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Dynamic Cellular Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable dual&#8208;emitting MOF&#8208;based material is constructed by integrating spiropyran as a cascade ET mediator with two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (C153) and methylene blue (MB) into rho&#8208;ZMOF. The system exhibits dynamically switchable green/red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift, showing great promise for high&#8208;resolution, depth&#8208;resolved bioimaging applications.








ABSTRACT
Photoswitchable dual&#8208;color fluorescent materials are highly valuable for applications in cellular imaging and super&#8208;resolution microscopy. However, realizing these materials, especially broadening their Stokes shift remains a critical challenge. Herein, a novel strategy for achieving photoswitchable dual&#8208;emission fluorescence with a large Stokes shift is proposed via a cascade energy transfer (ET) process in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). By incorporating the photoisomerizable molecule spiropyran as an ET intermediate, and two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (Cou153) and methylene blue (MB) within a MOF, rho&#8208;ZMOF, the dual&#8208;color dynamic luminescent material rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB is achieved. When excited at 400&#160;nm, rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB exhibits coumarin&#8208;centered green emission at 516&#160;nm and methylene blue&#8208;centered red fluorescence at 700&#160;nm, with a maximum Stokes shift of 300&#160;nm. More importantly, these dual&#8208;color emissions can be reversibly switched on or off upon altering UV&#8208; and visible&#8208;light irradiation because of the photoswitchable cascade energy transfer from coumarin 153 to methylene blue based on the photochromic transformation of spiropyran. As an example, the potential use of rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB in high&#8208;resolution and depth&#8208;resolved bioimaging is demonstrated.

It is revealed that uniform fillers significantly outperform widely&#8208;used non&#8208;uniform fillers in enhancing current intensity, addressing the bottleneck hindering the dramatic increase in shielding performance by general EMI performance improvement strategies. Therefore, the uniform Ga&#8208;particles filled insulating composite prepared by microfluidic technique exhibits superior shielding efficiency (&gt;90 dB) and thermal conductivity (3.7 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), effectively addressing EMC and overheating issues in integrated electronics.








Abstract
Electrically insulating electromagnetic interference shielding composites can block electromagnetic waves by inducing currents within microcapacitors, offering a downsized package paradigm for integrated electronics. However, this contradiction makes it challenging to achieve high shielding performance within insulating systems, which is fundamentally constrained by the difficulty in dramatically strengthening induced current intensity as it is sensitively mapped by the intricate microcapacitor structures. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that uniform fillers significantly boost current intensity within microcapacitors compared to that of widely&#8208;used random fillers by an integrated workflow combining machine learning and simulations, offering a targeted guideline for high&#8208;performance insulating shields. Guided by this, a microfluidic technique is utilized to produce uniform, monodisperse Gallium particles in high&#8208;throughput as fillers for insulating composites, which exhibit excellent shielding effectiveness (&gt;90 dB, Ka&#8208;band) and thermal conductivity (3.7&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at high resistivity (1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 &#937;&#183;m), outperforming conventional non&#8208;uniform and conductive systems. Its superior near&#8208;field shielding and heat&#8208;dissipation abilities allow for directly tackling electromagnetic compatibility and overheating issues without short&#8208;circuit failures over a wide temperature range (&#8722;196&#8211;200 &#176;C). Therefore, this work offers valuable insights into the manufacturing of high&#8208;performance insulating shields, potentially breaking the limitations of traditional low&#8208;throughput iterative experimentation and promoting microelectronics industry.

Abstract
Amidst the urgent global push for carbon neutrality, CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction has emerged as a critical technology for closing the carbon cycle and converting renewable energy. In this work, a hybrid catalyst, denoted as C&#8208;HL&#8208;20%/Ni(TTA)bpe (TTA = 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;;&#8208;tricarboxy&#8208;triphenylamine, bpe = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridine), is constructed through the rational design of a composite system incorporating carboxylated lignin (C&#8208;HL) and a single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). The catalyst demonstrates impressive photocatalytic performance, achieving a CO production rate of 6516.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.3% selectivity, which has reached the top level of the reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Under outdoor conditions, it also demonstrates a stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 4282.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that this high activity originates from donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) artificial structure of the single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;MOF and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process. Modification with C&#8208;HL introduces enriched &#9472;COOH groups, which form hydrogen bonds with the Ni(TTA)bpe framework. This not only consolidates the structure but also shortens the electron migration pathway, thereby achieving efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photo&#8208;conversion. This study establishes a rational catalyst design strategy for sustainable CO2 photoreduction, demonstrating a feasible pathway toward manageable carbon resource utilization.

         <title>3D Printing&#8208;Assisted Interpenetrating&#8208;Phase Composite Implant Materials Integrating Structural&#8208;Functional Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 9, 12 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interpenetrating&#8208;phase composite implant materials are fabricated by infiltrating one constituent into 3D&#8208;printed porous scaffolds of another. After implantation, they demonstrate two potential degradation pathways: selectively partial and sequentially complete degradation. Their mechanical/functional properties can be modulated by combining appropriate constituents and regulating their interpenetrating&#8208;phase structures. These materials hold significant promise for achieving structural&#8208;functional integration, offering new opportunities to enhance bone repair efficacy.








Abstract
Implant materials play a pivotal role in bone repair; however, existing materials face considerable challenges in simultaneously achieving adequate mechanical properties and biological functions. In this perspective, drawing inspiration from nature and leveraging 3D printing technologies, we propose a new strategy to achieve structural&#8208;functional integration through the development of bicontinuous interpenetrating&#8208;phase composite implant materials. These materials are fabricated by infiltrating one constituent into 3D&#8208;printed porous scaffolds of another, and demonstrate two potential degradation pathways after implantation &#8211; selectively partial degradation and sequentially complete degradation &#8211; depending on the types of constituents and their combinations. We elucidate the associated degradation behaviors, regulatory strategies, and the resulting biological functions, and analyze their underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms. Moreover, targeted functional integration and delivery can be realized by infiltrating hydrogels loaded with functional agents into 3D&#8208;printed scaffolds. The mechanical and functional properties of these materials can be deliberately modulated by selecting appropriate constituents and by designing and regulating the interpenetrating&#8208;phase structures. We further examine the challenges faced by these materials and outline prospective directions for future research. Distinct from conventional single&#8208;component materials, 3D printing&#8208;assisted composite implant materials hold significant promise for achieving structural&#8208;functional integration, thereby offering new opportunities to enhance bone repair efficacy.

         <title>Redirecting Charge Distribution and Spatial Proximity of Co&#8722;O&#8722;Cu Motif with 4f&#8722;2p&#8722;3d Orbital Hybridization for High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4f&#8722;2p&#8722;3d orbital hybridization maneuver is unveiled to customize a spin&#8208;polarized Co site for NO3&#8722; reduction to *NH2 and a relatively electron&#8208;rich Cu site for CO2 reduction to *CO. The interposed single&#8208;atom Ce narrows the distance between Co and Cu sites to spatially favor in situ C&#8210;N coupling of formed *NH2 and *CO, overall enabling urea electrosynthesis of high efficiency.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalytic CO2/NO3&#8722; co&#8208;reduction to access urea typically relies on the tailored two&#8208;site catalysts, with the complexity of C/N&#8208;intermediate generation and C&#9472;N coupling that limit urea synthesis efficiency. Here, a 4f (Ce)&#8722;2p (O)&#8722;3d (Co) orbital hybridization maneuver is demonstrated to customize a spin&#8208;polarized Co&#8208;site and a relatively electron&#8208;rich Cu&#8208;site for generating *NH2 and *CO species to undergo C&#9472;N coupling to access urea, respectively, delivering a production rate of 2612.4 &#181;g mg&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.27 VRHE, with an ultrahigh Faradaic efficiency (85.7%). Mechanistic investigations elucidate that the 4f&#8722;2p&#8722;3d motif enables the high&#8208;spin Co2+ (t2g5eg2) translation toward low&#8208;spin Co3+ (t2g6eg0), which enhances the electronic interaction between the eg&#8208;orbital of Co and &#120590;&#8208;orbital of *NO, favoring *NH2 formation. Further, the electron&#8208;deficient Co3+&#8208;site formed can act as a localized electron acceptor to manipulate the electron structure of the adjacent Cu&#8208;site, strengthening the hybridization degree between the catalyst's Cu 3d and C 2p of CO2 to foster *CO generation. Then, interposed Ce narrows the Co&#9472;O&#9472;Cu distance, which spatially benefits *NH2 and *CO coupling to form the C&#9472;N bond, overall promoting urea synthesis. The synergy of electronic interaction and geometric effect offers a feasible paradigm to precisely customize activity centers for high&#8208;efficiency waste feedstock valorization.

         <title>Complex&#8208;Concentrated Anion Doping Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Lattice Oxygen and Structural Integrity in Lithium&#8208;Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complex&#8208;concentrated anion&#8208;doping strategy is developed to enhance oxygen&#8208;redox and structural stability in lithium&#8208; and manganese&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR) cathodes. Trace F, Br, and S anions embedded in the oxygen sublattice synergistically enable reversible and stable oxygen redox, suppress oxygen loss and achieve zero&#8208;strain operation under high voltage. The resulting LMR cathode delivers ultralow voltage fade (0.55 mV per cycle) and outstanding energy retention (93% after 200 cycles) in a pouch cell configuration.








ABSTRACT
Lithium&#8208; and manganese&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMR) stand out as next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion cathode chemistries, which harness both transition&#8208;metal and lattice&#8208;oxygen redox processes to deliver exceptional capacity and energy density. However, their full potential is hindered by&#160;intrinsic oxygen instability and structural degradation, resulting in pronounced voltage fade and capacity decay. Here, we present a complex&#8208;concentrated anion&#8208;doping paradigm in which multiple anions, F, Br, and S, are incorporated into the oxygen sublattice to enhance oxygen&#8208;redox and structural stability. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm ultra&#8208;stable local oxygen coordination environments during long&#8208;term cycling, with detrimental phase transformations and oxygen&#8208;loss&#8208;induced cavitation dramatically inhibited.&#160;Notably, we show that the characteristic LiTM6 transition metal (TM) honeycomb ordering is preserved even after electrochemical cycling.&#160;Concurrently, this strategy yields an unprecedented volume change of only 0.63% upon charging to 4.8 V vs. Li+/Li, achieving the first zero&#8208;strain LMR cathode.&#160;The resulting LMR cathode delivers ultralow voltage fade (1 mV per cycle during the first 100 cycles and becomes negligible in&#160;subsequent cycles) and outstanding energy retention (93% after 200 cycles) in a&#160;pouch cell configuration. Our complex&#8208;concentrated anion&#8208;doping concept establishes a broadly applicable strategy for resolving chemo&#8208;mechanical failure mechanisms in ceramic intercalation electrodes for next&#8208;generation energy storage.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy confirm ultra-stable local oxygen coordination environments during long-term cycling, with detrimental phase transformations and oxygen-loss-induced cavitation dramatically inhibited.&#160;Notably, we show that the characteristic LiTM&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; transition metal (TM) honeycomb ordering is preserved even after electrochemical cycling.&#160;Concurrently, this strategy yields an unprecedented volume change of only 0.63% upon charging to 4.8 V vs. Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li, achieving the first zero-strain LMR cathode.&#160;The resulting LMR cathode delivers ultralow voltage fade (1 mV per cycle during the first 100 cycles and becomes negligible in&#160;subsequent cycles) and outstanding energy retention (93% after 200 cycles) in a&#160;pouch cell configuration. Our complex-concentrated anion-doping concept establishes a broadly applicable strategy for resolving chemo-mechanical failure mechanisms in ceramic intercalation electrodes for next-generation energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Dielectric Genes in Debye Relaxation Model toward Frequency&#8208;Band&#8208;Reliant Electromagnetic Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, based on the Debye relaxation model and integrating the concept of dielectric genes, the aim is to optimize the absorption frequency band and absorption effect of dielectric materials. Meanwhile, the challenges for dielectric absorption materials are put forward and the development direction is predicted.








ABSTRACT
Electromagnetic wave absorption (EMWA) materials are widely used in wireless communications and play an important role in contemporary smart economy. EMWA materials that show dielectric losses have attracted research attention owing to their unique advantages. However, previous studies have focused on material synthesis whereas few studies have systematically explained the mechanism of dielectric loss. Taking the concept of dielectric genes as the starting point and Debye relaxation model as the &#8220;compass,&#8221; the dependence of the electromagnetic wave absorption at different frequencies on each dielectric parameter is introduced in detail, and a dynamic trend model is constructed for the prediction of electromagnetic wave absorption characteristics, followed by discussion of the development and future prospects of EMWA materials, providing inspiration for the design of dielectric&#8208;loss absorption materials in the future.

         <title>An Enthalpy&#8208;Entropy Compensated Ionogel With a Broadband Viscoelastic Plateau for Non&#8208;Invasive and High&#8208;Fidelity Neurointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamic design paradigm resolves the adaptability&#8208;stability dilemma in bioelectronics. A low&#8208;entropy and high&#8208;interaction network formed by salt&#8208;bridge hydrogen bonds self&#8208;organizes into a bicontinuous nanostructure, enabling broadband enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation. The resulting stable solid&#8208;liquid state exhibits a nine&#8208;decade viscoelastic plateau spanning a wide temperature range. The ionogel enables non&#8208;invasive and high&#8208;fidelity electroencephalography recording for advanced emotion recognition.








ABSTRACT
Achieving non&#8208;invasive and high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological recording, particularly electroencephalography (EEG), on dynamic and irregular human skin remains a central challenge in soft bioelectronics, as materials rarely reconcile liquid&#8208;like adaptability with solid&#8208;like stability. Here, we overcome this limitation by designing a viscoelastic ionogel governed by a dynamic enthalpy&#8208;entropy balance. Salt&#8208;bridge hydrogen bonds form a low&#8208;entropy and high&#8208;interaction network, intrinsically limiting the capacity for entropic energy storage. This network then self&#8208;organizes with a soft phase into a bicontinuous nanostructure. Acting as a mechanical parallel circuit, this architecture introduces a broad molecular relaxation spectrum, providing broadband enthalpic dissipation and realizing broadband enthalpy&#8208;entropy compensation. Consequently, the ionogel exhibits a frequency&#8208;independent viscoelastic plateau (G&#8242;&#8776;G&#8242;&#8242;) spanning over nine orders of magnitude in frequency (10&#8722;4 to 105&#160;Hz) and a wide temperature range (&#8722;30&#176;C to 40&#176;C). The ionogel reduces skin&#8208;electrode impedance by more than an order of magnitude compared to commercial electrodes and maintains high&#8208;fidelity electrophysiological recordings during 72&#8208;h continuous wear. Integrated with a deep learning framework, it enables high&#8208;precision decoding of EEG signals, achieving 95% accuracy in classifying eight distinct emotional states. This work establishes a generalizable thermodynamic design principle for soft bioelectronic interfaces, offering broad potential for neural diagnostics, emotional monitoring, and wearable neuroprosthetics.

         <title>Reducing the Strain Required for Ambient&#8208;Pressure Superconductivity in Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Bilayer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconductivity in bilayer nickelates has previously required strong compressive strain from SrLaAlO4 (001) (SLAO) substrates. Here we demonstrate ambient&#8208;pressure superconductivity in films grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO),&#160;where the strain is nearly halved. This discovery situates the system near the superconducting phase boundary, opening new avenues to explore the interplay between strain, electronic correlations, and superconductivity.








ABSTRACT
The discovery of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity in pressurized bulk Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) bilayer nickelates has prompted the conjecture that epitaxial compressive strain might mimic essential aspects of hydrostatic pressure. The realization of superconductivity in films on SrLaAlO4 (001) (SLAO) supports this correspondence, yet it remains unclear whether the pressure&#8211;temperature phase diagram of RP bilayer nickelates can be systematically mapped (and studied at ambient pressure) as a function of epitaxial strain. To this end, experimental access near the elusive edge of the superconducting phase boundary would provide invaluable insight into the nature of the superconducting state and the ground state from which it emerges. Here we report superconducting RP bilayer nickelates grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO), where the compressive strain required for ambient&#8208;pressure superconductivity is nearly halved to &#8722;1.2%. These films exhibit a superconducting onset above 10&#160;K and reach zero resistance at 3&#160;K, with normal&#8208;state transport properties differing from those of films grown on SLAO. Our comparative study shows that strain&#8211;rather than interfacial structure is the primary factor governing the superconductivity and normal&#8208;state properties. This work offers a new opportunity to probe emergent phenomena near the superconducting phase boundary in the strain&#8211;temperature phase diagram of RP bilayer nickelates.

         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired visual&#8211;tactile fusion architecture integrates a novel fabric&#8208;based tactile interface with visual information, enables autonomous decision&#8208;making and behavior optimization for intelligent agent. The architecture shows stable and dexterous operation in complex scenarios, such as similar object recognition, adaptive grasping, and underwater exploration, demonstrating great potential for advancing embodied intelligence.








ABSTRACT
Embodied intelligent agents, which represent the future of robotics, demand precise perception and real&#8208;time decision&#8208;making capabilities to achieve natural environmental interactions. However current systems face inherent limitations in unimodal sensing and cross&#8208;modal coordination, which hinder their performance in dynamic contact&#8208;rich operations. Herein, we present a fabric&#8208;based event&#8208;driven tactile interface that features an innovative woven structure with cross&#8208;fiber electrodes. It achieves breakthroughs in sensitivity (246.3&#160;kPa&#8722;1), pressure detection (&gt;450&#160;kPa), and waterproof robustness. This interface enables millisecond&#8208;level pressure/slip dual&#8208;mode feedback for self&#8208;adaptive grasping, thereby improving the dexterous manipulation of fragile or slippery objects. For underwater scenarios, a bio&#8208;inspired visual&#8211;tactile fusion (VTF) architecture leverages tactile perception to compensate for visual limitations, demonstrating a high accuracy of 97.7% in complex tasks, including underwater transparent object manipulation and recognition of similar objects. Event&#8208;driven tactile feedback is merged with visual semantics for decision&#8208;level optimization, thereby enhancing the autonomy and adaptation of humanoid machine intelligence. It creates an innovative closed&#8208;loop cross&#8208;modal perception&#8211;decision system that builds a direct link between environmental interaction and autonomous decision&#8208;making for intelligent agent development in open&#8208;world scenarios. The superior performance of the VTF architecture dynamic interaction tasks represents a crucial step toward robotic systems with advanced intelligence.

The search for advanced battery materials is pushing us into highly complex composition spaces. Here, a space with about 14 million unique combinations is efficiently explored using high&#8208;throughput experimentation guided by Bayesian optimization with a deep kernel trained on both the Materials Project database and our data. The outcome is a cathode material optimized for four important battery metrics.








ABSTRACT
To further improve secondary battery materials, we are increasingly exploring highly complex composition spaces in attempts to optimize multiple properties simultaneously. While our past work has done this in systematic manners using high&#8208;throughput experimentation, the exponential increase in the search space with triple doping makes grid search prohibitively expensive. Here, we demonstrate a closed&#8208;loop, multi&#8208;objective machine learning approach to guide the high&#8208;throughput workflow to efficiently navigate a space with approximately 14 million unique combinations. The test system is LiCoPO4, which we have previously explored using systematic codoping that was effective in optimizing one property only: energy density. To learn multiple electrochemical metrics, we first pretrain a set transformer on the public Materials Project database as a feature extractor, then attach a multi&#8208;task Gaussian process head and finetune the entire model on our high&#8208;throughput data. Through 3 rounds of active learning, we demonstrate that with a very small number of samples (as few as 125 random compositions and 63 predicted), we are able to simultaneously optimize four key electrochemical properties. Relative to the undoped system, the best composition raises our composite figure of merit up to five times. This establishes an end&#8208;to&#8208;end workflow for accelerated battery materials design to be used in the rapidly growing field of autonomous materials discovery.

         <title>Beyond Earth: Resilience of Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells in Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202520433), Christoph Putz and co&#8208;workers demonstrate rigid quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells operating in low Earth orbit, delivering stable power for more than 100 days under real&#8208;space conditions. In&#8208;orbit performance is correlated with extensive ground&#8208;based thermal and proton&#8208;irradiation studies on rigid and ultrathin devices, revealing high intrinsic radiation tolerance, substrate&#8208;driven losses, and key challenges for future lightweight perovskite space photovoltaics.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer unique advantages for space&#8208;based energy harvesting, combining cost&#8208;effective manufacturing with flexible, high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight devices that can reduce payload mass in deployable structures. Despite this promise, few reports have demonstrated the viability of this technology in realistic, space&#8208;based scenarios, where they are subjected to large temperature variations and hard radiation. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of PSC performance in low Earth orbit (LEO). The champion rigid cell exhibited relatively stable in&#8208;orbit performance at &#8764;80% of initial efficiency over a 44&#8208;day measurement interval that concluded nearly 100 days after launch, corresponding to &#8764;1600 orbital eclipse cycles and temperature ranges from &#8722;25 to 35&#176;C. Mission data was systematically compared with laboratory measurements of rigid and ultrathin flexible PSCs across temperatures from &#8722;80 to +80&#176;C and upon exposure to high&#8208;energy proton radiation. Flexible devices retained over 92% efficiency after a proton dose equivalent to 50 years in orbit. Despite this radiation tolerance, mitigating pre&#8208;flight environmental degradation remains a challenge for ultrathin substrates. Combined, this study bridges the gap between short suborbital demonstrations and long&#8208;term orbital performance, highlighting the potential of PSCs as a low&#8208;cost, resilient alternative for light harvesting, even in harsh space environments.

         <title>Harnessing Dynamic Metal&#8208;Oxide Interfaces for Durably Active Fuel Cell Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ultrathin p&#8208;block metal oxide overlayers was constructed on Pt&#8208;based nanoparticle fuel cell catalysts, where a &#8220;breathing&#8221; interface behavior is revealed, showing the reversible transformation between oxygen&#8208;inserted/extracted interfaces at oxidative/reductive potentials, respectively. The dynamic metal&#8208;oxide interface represents a new and generalizable strategy in improving both the activity and the stability of Pt&#8208;based fuel cell electrocatalysts.








ABSTRACT
While metal&#8208;oxide interfaces can profoundly modulate the performance of (electro)catalysts, their dynamic nature under operational conditions remains poorly understood, and a compromise between activity and stability persists as a central challenge. Herein, we reveal a dynamic, &#8220;breathing&#8221; interface behavior in MOx/Pt (M = In, Sn, Sb) systems during the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells. By constructing well&#8208;defined Pt octahedra decorated with ultrathin p&#8208;block metal oxide overlayers, we demonstrate that an oxygen&#8208;deficient M&#8211;Pt interface forms at reducing potentials and improves the ORR activity following a trend of In&#8211;Pt &gt; Sn&#8211;Pt &#8764; Sb&#8211;Pt via interfacial charge transfer, while oxidizing potentials generate an oxygen&#8208;enriched M&#8211;O&#8211;Pt structure that effectively suppresses Pt dissolution and improves catalytic durability, particularly with SnOx overlayers. We further validate that harnessing the dynamic metal&#8208;oxide interfaces represents a new and generalizable strategy to break the activity and stability trade&#8208;off for a wide range of shaped or non&#8208;shaped Pt and Pt&#8208;bimetallic catalysts, most notably in InSnOx&#8208;decorated PtCo catalysts.

         <title>Separation of Hydrogen and Graphite from Natural Gas Through Nickel Atomic Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic lattice separation method is proposed to achieve efficient and continuous conversion of natural gas into clean energy of hydrogen and high&#8208;value matter of crystalline graphite. The process delivers &gt; 99% conversion, &#8805; 300 h stability, and &#8805; 5 cycles reusability. When integrated with fuel cells, it achieves &#8764;57% hydrogen&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion efficiency, offering a promising pathway toward sustainable fossil fuel utilization.








ABSTRACT
The sustainable use of fossil fuels requires simultaneous efficient utilization of both energy and matter. Traditional fossil fuel processes primarily harvest energy through combustion, leaving much of the matter&#8212;especially carbon&#8212;unexploited and released in the form of greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide). Here, we develop an atomic lattice separation method using a nickel foam&#8208;nickel foil structure to simultaneously extract both energy and matter from natural gas with high efficiency. In this design, hydrogen in natural gas is catalytically converted to hydrogen gas on nickel foam, while carbon is transformed into crystalline graphite via transport through the atomic lattice of nickel foil. This approach achieved efficient (&gt; 99% conversion), stable (&#8805; 300 h stability), and reusable (&#8805; 5 cycles) hydrogen gas generation, coupled with the production of high&#8208;value graphite with an ultrahigh crystal quality and superior thermal and electrical properties. Further integration with a solid oxide fuel cell system demonstrated an electricity generation efficiency of &#8764;57%. This strategy establishes a sustainable pathway for separating energy (hydrogen) and matter (graphite) from hydrocarbons, thus providing new opportunities for high&#8208;efficiency and zero&#8208;emission natural gas utilization.

         <title>A Paradigm Shift in Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Battery: Pressure&#8208;Activated Solid&#8208;State Interfaces for High&#8208;Rate Desolvated Cation Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving durable anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries requires overcoming unstable ion flux and dendritic growth. This work constructs a pressure&#8208;activated solid&#8208;state Li+ pathway via a montmorillonite&#8208;based composite separator and a defect&#8208;engineered substrate, which enables dendrite&#8208;free plating and exceptional cycling stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cells.








ABSTRACT
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AF&#8208;LMBs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric/volumetric energy densities (&gt; 400 Wh kg&#8722;1/1000 Wh L&#8722;1) and simplified anode manufacturing as compared to conventional alkali&#8208;ion batteries that rely on intercalation chemistry. However, their practical implementation remains plagued by dendritic protrusion from the substrate and rapid lithium inventory depletion, which further exacerbate in Ah&#8208;scale pouch cells. Here, this study innovates a paradigm shift through a multiscale interfacial strategy addressing the core limitations of AF&#8208;LMBs. Scalable cation&#8208;exchange and mechanical exfoliation firstly produce few&#8208;layer lithium montmorillonite nanosheets that integrated with polyacrylamide gel, which are functionalized onto the polyethylene separator (FMT&#8208;Li/PAM&#8208;PE). The composite separator thus reconciles high mechanical strength (204.4 MPa), thermal stability (&lt; 2.5% shrinkage at 180&#176;C), anion screening capability (t+ = 0.78), and pressure&#8208;activated adhesion to the substrate (peel strength &gt; 3.4 N m&#8722;1 via hydrogen bonding).&#160;Upon the formation cycle at stack pressure of 0.5&#160;MPa, more crucially, the composite separator intimately attaches onto the Cu substrate modified with the recycled spent graphite rich in lithiophilic defects (SGR&#8208;Cu), establishing the solid&#8208;state Li+ diffusion pathway at the separator&#8208;anode interface and mitigating solvated Li+ interaction. As assembled with a densely&#8208;packed LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (3.6&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) cathode, the 1.0 Ah pouch cell achieves 81.1% capacity retention over 200 cycles, gravimetric/volumetric energy densities of 453.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1/ 1183.2 Wh L&#8722;1 and extreme power output of 1045.0 W kg&#8722;1.&#160;Beyond insights into multiscale ion regulation, this interfacial strategy also unlocks viability across diverse cell configurations (e.g., LiFePO4/Ni92||Cu), enabling the high&#8208;rate cation diffusion for the commercial AF&#8208;LMB prototyping.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anode-free lithium metal batteries (AF-LMBs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric/volumetric energy densities (&amp;gt; 400 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/1000 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and simplified anode manufacturing as compared to conventional alkali-ion batteries that rely on intercalation chemistry. However, their practical implementation remains plagued by dendritic protrusion from the substrate and rapid lithium inventory depletion, which further exacerbate in Ah-scale pouch cells. Here, this study innovates a paradigm shift through a multiscale interfacial strategy addressing the core limitations of AF-LMBs. Scalable cation-exchange and mechanical exfoliation firstly produce few-layer lithium montmorillonite nanosheets that integrated with polyacrylamide gel, which are functionalized onto the polyethylene separator (FMT-Li/PAM-PE). The composite separator thus reconciles high mechanical strength (204.4 MPa), thermal stability (&amp;lt; 2.5% shrinkage at 180&#176;C), anion screening capability (t&lt;sub&gt;+&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.78), and pressure-activated adhesion to the substrate (peel strength &amp;gt; 3.4 N m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; via hydrogen bonding).&#160;Upon the formation cycle at stack pressure of 0.5&#160;MPa, more crucially, the composite separator intimately attaches onto the Cu substrate modified with the recycled spent graphite rich in lithiophilic defects (SGR-Cu), establishing the solid-state Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion pathway at the separator-anode interface and mitigating solvated Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interaction. As assembled with a densely-packed LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.6&#160;mAh&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) cathode, the 1.0 Ah pouch cell achieves 81.1% capacity retention over 200 cycles, gravimetric/volumetric energy densities of 453.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/ 1183.2 Wh L&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and extreme power output of 1045.0 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&#160;Beyond insights into multiscale ion regulation, this interfacial strategy also unlocks viability across diverse cell configurations (e.g., LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni92||Cu), enabling the high-rate cation diffusion for the commercial AF-LMB prototyping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Defect&#8208;Driven Ferroelectric Mechanisms of Aluminum Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by the hypothesis that polarization reversal in wurtzite AlN proceeds by localized, defect&#8208;assisted pathways, keV He+ direct&#8208;write irradiation is used to induce and tune ferroelectricity via nanoscale defect patterning. Experiments and NEB&#8208;guided simulations implicate nitrogen vacancies as barrier&#8208;lowering agents that disrupt bond ordering and enable heterogeneous, line&#8208;by&#8208;line (columnar) switching, reducing switching voltage by up to 41% without amorphization.








ABSTRACT
Wurtzite III&#8208;nitride compounds are CMOS&#8208;compatible with widespread industrial interest to exercise ferroelectricity, despite their polar structure being highly resistant to polarization reversal. Here, we induce and tune ferroelectric properties in w&#8208;AlN via direct&#8208;write ion&#8208;beam processing, using nanoscale patterned defect engineering as a post&#8208;growth alternative to conventional cation substitution. Nanometric piezoresponse spectroscopy of the focused He+ beam patterned defect concentrations in ferroelectric Al0.92B0.08N measures a localized 10x enhancement in effective piezoresponse and 40% reduction in switching barrier. The irradiation&#8208;induced point defects convert piezoelectric AlN into a ferroelectric system with site&#8208;saturated nucleation and raise the dielectric susceptibility, switched polarization, and effective piezoelectric coefficient. Enhanced defect&#8208;lattice interactions in AlN increase carrier conduction and phonon scattering loss but preserve long&#8208;range crystallinity. Based on atomistic analysis of nudged elastic band density functional theory calculations and reactive force field simulations, both nitrogen vacancies and defect complexes disrupt bond ordering, facilitating a line&#8208;by&#8208;line low&#8208;barrier switching of pristine AlN.

         <title>Multilevel Heterointerface Engineering Breaks the Trap&#8208;Barrier Trade&#8208;Off in High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Polymer Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multilevel heterointerface formed by a lattice&#8208;interlocked BNO@BN junction generates a built&#8208;in electric field that sequentially blocks electron injection, guides carrier transport, and immobilizes carriers. This cooperative trap&#8208;barrier regulation suppresses conduction loss under extreme electro&#8208;thermal stress, enabling PEI composites to achieve exceptional energy&#8208;storage performance and offering a generalizable route for advanced polymer dielectrics.








ABSTRACT
The low energy density, inefficient operation, and thermal instability of polymer dielectrics hinder the deployment of film capacitors under harsh environmental conditions. Interface engineering has emerged as a powerful strategy to introduce charge traps or construct interfacial barriers, thereby regulating carrier dynamics and enhancing energy storage. Here, we propose a multilevel heterointerface engineering strategy that integrates boron nitride and barium niobate nanosheets through lattice interlocking. The large work&#8208;function offset and bandgap contrast induce interfacial band bending and a built&#8208;in electric field, forming a complementary trap&#8208;barrier network that guides, blocks, and confines charge carriers. This design effectively suppresses charge injection and mobility, enhances interfacial polarization, and mitigates the propagation of breakdown pathways. Consequently, BNO@BN/PEI composites achieve exceptional energy storage performance, delivering 9.02 J cm&#8722;3 (&#951; = 92%) at room temperature and sustaining 6.1 J cm&#8722;3 (&#951; &#8776; 90%) at 150&#176;C, while still preserving 4.6 J cm&#8722;3 at 200&#176;C. First&#8208;principles calculations and finite element simulations further validate the structural and functional superiority of the multilevel heterointerface. This work establishes multilevel heterointerface engineering as a generalizable paradigm for breaking the trap&#8208;barrier trade&#8208;off in conventional dielectric design and paves the way for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and thermally robust polymer capacitors.

         <dc:description>
Spintronics, utilizing the electron's spin, offers a transformative path for energy&#8208;efficient artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. This review examines novel spintronic materials and devices that enable cutting&#8208;edge computing paradigms, including in&#8208;memory, neuromorphic, and probabilistic computing, underscoring their potential to overcome the limitations of traditional electronics and advance next&#8208;generation AI technologies and systems.








ABSTRACT
The core of spintronic technologies lies in the use of electrons&#8217; intrinsic spin states, along with their electric charge, for information storage and processing. Spin&#8208;based manipulation of electronic devices inherently enables exceptional properties, such as infinite endurance, high&#8208;speed operation, scalability, and non&#8208;volatility. These attributes make spintronic devices highly suitable for addressing the growing demands of artificial intelligence (AI) for energy&#8208;efficient, scalable computing hardware across diverse applications. This review begins by introducing the fundamental principles of spintronics, emphasizing its unique advantages for AI applications, and providing an overview of spintronic device architectures. We then examine recent advances in emerging spintronic materials, including antiferromagnets, 2D magnets, altermagnets, and topological magnetic materials. The diverse spintronic materials and structures contribute to the realization of various cutting&#8208;edge AI technologies. We will highlight in&#8208;memory computing, which minimizes energy for data transfer; neuromorphic computing, which emulates the architecture and functionality of the human brain; and probabilistic computing, which harnesses stochastic spintronic behaviors for hardware&#8208;efficient computation. Finally, we conclude the review by highlighting the challenges and the critical role of fundamental materials research in unlocking the full potential of spintronics, which contributes to driving AI technologies and systems forward.

         <title>Opto&#8208;Ferroelectric Coupling Enhanced &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 Transistors With Light&#8208;Controlled Mode Switchover</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops an opto&#8208;ferroelectric coupling enhanced field&#8208;effect transistor with &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/h&#8208;BN as gate dielectrics and MoS2 as channel. By changing light conditions, the hysteresis window and ferroelectric polarization field can be dynamically modulated due to an opto&#8208;ferroelectric coupling effect, which enables the light&#8208;controlled mode switchover between digital logic processing and artificial synapse, offering a new pathway for next&#8208;generation computing devices.








ABSTRACT
Neuromorphic computing is an ideal approach for achieving complex pattern recognition works; however, it is usually incompatible with digital logic processing units, limiting its application scope. Leveraging an opto&#8208;ferroelectric coupling enhanced effect, we herein achieve the light&#8208;controlled mode switchover between logic processing and neuromorphic computing in a ferroelectric transistor with &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/h&#8208;BN as gate dielectrics and MoS2 as channel. Under dark conditions, the transistor operates in digital logic mode with a high current on/off ratio of 109, ultra&#8208;low subthreshold swing (SS) of 33&#160;mV/dec, and low leakage current of 5.6 &#215; 10&#8722;13 A, which is promising for logic processing applications. The inverter and NOR circuits with high noise margin and low power consumption were further implemented via interconnecting n&#8208; and p&#8208;type transistors. Under light conditions, the ferroelectric polarization field of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is significantly enhanced, leading to an enlarged hysteresis window (&#916;V) and switching the transistor into an optoelectronic synapse mode for neuromorphic computing, which can support image classification with an accuracy of up to 94.43% and a low energy consumption of 0.47 pJ/spike. This work provides an opto&#8208;ferroelectric coupling&#8208;enhanced transistor that addresses the incompatibility issue between digital logic and neuromorphic computing units, offering a new pathway for next&#8208;generation computing devices.

         <title>Heterogeneous Network SLIPS Coating with Soft&#8208;Hard Chain Integration Design for Marine Antifouling Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) are limited by mechanical fragility, lubricant depletion, and poor surface restoration. To address this, we employ &#8220;molecular topology engineering&#8221; to create a heterogeneous rigid&#8208;flexible network. The coating exhibits controlled lubricant release, superior fouling resistance, durability, and self&#8208;healing, enabling long&#8208;term marine antifouling.








ABSTRACT
Developing durable coatings that sustain long&#8208;term antifouling activity is critical for the reliable operation of ocean monitoring systems in biologically complex marine environments. Here, we report a heterogeneous&#8208;network slippery liquid&#8208;infused porous surface (SLIPS) coating engineered through a molecular design strategy. This design integrates a low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy rigid framework with a dynamic, self&#8208;healing soft network. The rigid framework is formed by a cross&#8208;linked network of thiol&#8208;functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS&#8208;(SH)8) and fluorinated liquid nitrile rubber (F13&#8208;LNBR). The soft network is based on a three&#8208;arm cross&#8208;linked structure constructed from hexamethylene&#8208;diisocyanate isocyanurate trimer (THDI) and 2&#8208;ureido&#8208;4[1H]&#8208;pyrimidinone (UPy) units. Infused with silicone oil, the coating exhibits robust mechanical strength, demonstrated by an erosion rate of 74.37&#160;nm/s, and autonomous self&#8208;healing capability enabled by multiple hydrogen bonds in both aerial and underwater conditions. Remarkably, the release rate of the silicone oil and the uniformity of surface hydrophobicity are precisely regulated by incorporating UPy units with tailored molecular structures and perfluoroacrylate monomers with varying hydrophobic chain lengths. Owing to these rational design elements, the coating repels a broad spectrum of fouling agents, including bacteria, algae, and highly viscous crude oil, while maintaining excellent flexibility and wear resistance. During a 90&#8208;day field test in real seawater, the coating's transmittance decreased by only 5.8%. This synergistic design addresses key limitations in current SLIPS technologies, offering a viable pathway toward long&#8208;term antifouling performance in challenging marine environments.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Reticular Materials for Gas&#8208; and Liquid&#8208;Phase Hydrocarbon Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal engineering enables systematic study of structure/function relationships as exemplified by pore engineering of reticular sorbents, including porous coordination networks and covalent organic frameworks. This review assesses such studies applied across the full scope of industrially relevant hydrocarbon separations to provide insight into how reticular sorbents offer low energy alternatives to conventional separation processes like cryogenic distillation and solvent extraction.








ABSTRACT
Crystal engineering focuses upon the design, properties, and applications of crystals, whereas reticular chemistry involves linking molecular building blocks to create network structures. The intersection of these areas is evident in the number of systematic studies of structure/function relationships concerning porous coordination networks (PCNs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). PCNs and COFs are inherently modular in nature and therefore amenable to systematic fine&#8208;tuning of both pore size and chemistry in a manner that is infeasible for other classes of porous solid. This review highlights how this exquisite control over pore size and chemistry has enabled the development of a new generation of physisorbents that are effective in the context of industrially relevant hydrocarbon (HC) separations. The motivation behind such reticular sorbents is the need to replace today's energy&#8208;intensive HC separation methods with more sustainable alternatives. Physisorbents are attractive in this context as they can offer the high selectivity needed for trace removal of impurities along with relatively low energy of recycling. This review details how crystal engineering strategies offer precise control of pore size and chemistry to enable HC selectivity to reach hitherto unprecedented levels. Nevertheless, despite these property advances, challenges remain to be addressed before commercial adoption becomes feasible.

         <title>Ultrathin Mesoporous Ionic Brushes Separator Enables Fast and Durable Zinc&#8208;Metal Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reported separators remain excessively thick and exhibit unsatisfying anti&#8208;dendrite and anti&#8208;corrosion ability, which greatly restricts the energy density and lifespan of batteries. Herein, we introduce a 27 &#181;m mesoporous ionic brushes (MiB) separator to accelerate ion transport and regulate interfacial solvation chemistry simultaneously for resisting dendrite formation and electrode corrosion, triggering fast and durable ZnABs.








ABSTRACT
Zinc metal aqueous batteries (ZnABs) emerge as promising candidates for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, yet severe Zn dendrite formation and anode side reactions degrade cycle life and hinder practical application. Herein, we report an ultrathin (27&#160;&#181;m) mesoporous ionic brushes (MiB) separator based on sulfonic grafted ordered mesoporous silica nanosheets for stable ZnABs. The well&#8208;ordered perforative mesopores architecture functions as an ion rectifier that achieves enhanced transfer kinetics and a homogeneous concentration field, thereby promoting dendrite&#8208;free deposition, as verified by in situ digital holography and kinetic analyses. Moreover, ionic brushes confined within nanochannels selectively capture water molecules from the primary solvation shell of Zn2+, facilitating desolvation and constructing a localized water&#8208;lean interfacial environment, which effectively suppresses water&#8208;related side reactions, as evidenced by various in situ spectroscopy, electrochemical analyses, and theoretical calculations. Consequently, the MiB separator enables the Zn anode to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7%, ultralong lifespan over 4300&#160;h, fast plating kinetics of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and high Zn utilization rate of 51.6%. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;V2O5 cells achieve perdurable capacity retention of 91.5% after 3500 cycles. This work presents a rational mesoporous separator design that synchronously regulates ion transport and interfacial solvation chemistry for highly reversible ZnABs.

         <title>Interfacial Modulation for Anti&#8208;Disproportionation in Zr&#8208;Nb&#8208;Fe&#8208;Ni Based Hydrogen Isotope Storage Alloys Driven by Product Destabilization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minor Nb substitution in Zr2Fe&#8208;based alloy constructs an inert interface between the disproportionation and general hydride, effectively inhibiting interfacial evolution behaviors of the disproportionation phase, where dispersed Nb acts as pinning centers that retard ZrH2 nucleation and growth. The obtained Zr1.9Nb0.1Fe0.7Ni0.3&#8208;H system exhibits excellent hydrogenation performance and outstanding durability.








ABSTRACT
Thermal/hydrogen&#8208;induced disproportionation is one of the most fatal obstacles for practical Zr2Fe&#8208;based hydrogen isotope storage alloys. Here, an interfacial transport inhibition effect at the disproportionation interface is revealed, in which theoretical screening from a product&#8208;destabilization perspective identifies minor Nb substitution as an effective route to developing a disproportionation&#8208;resistant Zr1.9Nb0.1Fe0.7Ni0.3 alloy. This composition preserves an ultralow equilibrium hydrogen pressure and accelerated hydrogen absorption kinetics, while simultaneously delivering markedly enhanced resistance to disproportionation and outstanding cycling stability under harsh conditions. By integrating experimental results with thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, this work directs modification studies toward the viewpoint of interfacial transport kinetics for disproportionation. Combined density functional theory analyses and Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations systematically reveal that dispersed substitutional Nb atoms act as interfacial pinning centers at the hydride/disproportionation interfaces, effectively inhibiting detrimental interfacial phase transformation, closely related to weakened interfacial bonding strength, charge transfer, and orbital hybridization. Consequently, disproportionation&#8208;related atomic rearrangement as well as the nucleation and growth of ZrH2 are kinetically retarded.

&lt;p&gt;Minor Nb substitution in Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe-based alloy constructs an inert interface between the disproportionation and general hydride, effectively inhibiting interfacial evolution behaviors of the disproportionation phase, where dispersed Nb acts as pinning centers that retard ZrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nucleation and growth. The obtained Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.9&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;-H system exhibits excellent hydrogenation performance and outstanding durability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermal/hydrogen-induced disproportionation is one of the most fatal obstacles for practical Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe-based hydrogen isotope storage alloys. Here, an interfacial transport inhibition effect at the disproportionation interface is revealed, in which theoretical screening from a product-destabilization perspective identifies minor Nb substitution as an effective route to developing a disproportionation-resistant Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.9&lt;/sub&gt;Nb&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt; alloy. This composition preserves an ultralow equilibrium hydrogen pressure and accelerated hydrogen absorption kinetics, while simultaneously delivering markedly enhanced resistance to disproportionation and outstanding cycling stability under harsh conditions. By integrating experimental results with thermodynamic and kinetic analyses, this work directs modification studies toward the viewpoint of interfacial transport kinetics for disproportionation. Combined density functional theory analyses and Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations systematically reveal that dispersed substitutional Nb atoms act as interfacial pinning centers at the hydride/disproportionation interfaces, effectively inhibiting detrimental interfacial phase transformation, closely related to weakened interfacial bonding strength, charge transfer, and orbital hybridization. Consequently, disproportionation-related atomic rearrangement as well as the nucleation and growth of ZrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are kinetically retarded. For the first time, these findings demonstrated that targeted interfacial kinetic engineering constitutes an effective strategy for suppressing disproportionation in Zr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe-based hydrogen storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Waste to Catalyst: Tuning Structure and Composition of Ferrous Scrap&#8208;Derived Alloys by Rapid Solidification for Advanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The performance of ferrous scrap&#8208;derived alloys as AOPs catalysts can be enhanced by a rapid solidification strategy. Optimizing the structure of catalysts&#8212;from the &#945;&#8208;phase to the &#949;&#8208;phase and then an amorphous phase&#8212;achieves a degradation efficiency of 98% within 40 s. Furthermore, optimizing the composition improves stability and develops a novel self&#8208;supporting catalyst with dual functionality.








ABSTRACT
A significant amount of ferrous scrap resources remain unrecycled, and the abundant iron content gives them potential as environmental catalysts. However, the practical application of ferrous scrap in catalysis remains a significant challenge. Herein, a strategy based on rapid solidification to increase the specific surface area, regulate the microstructure, and introduce high residual stress in ferrous scrap is proposed, leading to enhanced catalytic performance. The introduction of high residual stress and the construction of an amorphous structure significantly enhance performance, enabling a degradation efficiency of 98% within 40 s and a high kobs of 5.866 min&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations reveal that progressively optimizing the phase structure&#8212;from the &#945;&#8208;phase to the &#949;&#8208;phase and then an amorphous phase&#8212;promotes persulfate (PS) adsorption, and significantly enhances the electron transfer capability. Furthermore, optimizing the composition of the catalyst improves its stability to 30 cycles and develops a novel catalyst with dual functionality for both pollutant degradation and water electrolysis, exhibiting an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotential &#951;10 of 309&#160;mV. These findings provide a new perspective for the recycling of ferrous scrap and offer innovative ideas for developing multifunctional catalytic materials, which are capable of addressing integrated challenges in water treatment and clean energy conversion.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Scale&#8208;Patterned Anion Exchange Membrane With Coupled Interface for Durable Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;scale anion exchange membrane bridges efficient ion conduction with robust catalyst adhesion. Its molecular design promotes microphase separation for bulk transport within the membrane, while a biomimetic micro&#8208;nano pattern enables interfacial mechanical interlocking. This synergy yields a record&#8208;high hydroxide conductivity of 338.2 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80 &#176;C and stable water electrolysis.








ABSTRACT
The widespread adoption of anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis is impeded by rapid performance decay, largely caused by catalyst layer detachment under low catalyst loading conditions. To overcome this, we present a structurally graded AEM design that establishes efficient transport pathways from the molecular level to the membrane/catalyst layer interface. At the bulk transport level, molecular dynamics simulations and experimental validation confirm that the designed polymer matrix, based on the C&#8208;F backbone and flexible cationic side chains, promotes favorable microphase separation. This leads to well&#8208;connected ionic nanochannels that facilitate superior bulk hydroxide conduction. At the membrane/catalyst interface, a biomimetic micro&#8208;nano pattern, inspired by aquatic plants, is engineered onto the membrane surface via an industrially scalable embossing calendaring process. The resulting patterned interface optimizes interfacial contact, enhancing catalyst adhesion and mass transfer. By integrating these two scales of transport, a highly efficient membrane electrode assembly is realized, enabling synergistic management of ions, water, and gas bubbles. The resulting AEM achieves a record&#8208;high hydroxide ion conductivity of 338.2 mS cm&#8722;1 at 80&#176;C and exceptional ductility, with elongation of 162.0%, surpassing all previously reported AEMs. More importantly, the water electrolysis demonstrates markedly enhanced operational stability under various conditions.

         <title>Oriented Microstructured Scintillator for High&#8208;Resolution X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel oriented microstructured glass composite scintillator is successfully constructed by triggering the oriented crystallization habit of the metastable glass, which addresses the current challenge of achieving large&#8208;scale, highly uniform integration in structured scintillators. The constructed oriented microstructured glass composite scintillator exhibits excellent optical performance and light confinement capabilities, which have demonstrated a significant application potential in high&#8208;resolution imaging. The results not only provide a new reference scheme for high&#8208;performance integrated scintillator design but also represent an advancement toward high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with structured scintillators.








ABSTRACT
The structured scintillator is regarded as the sole strategy for achieving high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. Unfortunately, the construction of large&#8208;sized and uniform integrated candidates with oriented microstructure remains an insurmountable challenge. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a novel large&#8208;scale, highly uniform integrated oriented microstructured glass composite scintillator by triggering the oriented crystallization habit of the metastable glass. It is featured by columnar microcrystalline arrays with a high refractive index embedded in the glass phase with a relatively low refractive index. This enables to form an intrinsic waveguide configuration with light confinement capabilities, in which the directional propagation of photons can be realized. As a result, an excellent scintillation performance with the X&#8208;ray excited luminescence intensity of 5.67 times that of BGO can be realized. It also demonstrates the excellent environmental resistance because of the all&#8208;oxide system. By using this oriented microstructured glass composite scintillator, the X&#8208;ray imaging system is built, and an impressive imaging resolution of 30 lp mm&#8722;1 is successfully achieved. The progress represents a giant step toward high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging with structured scintillators.

         <title>Covalent Amorphous Alumina&#8208;Hydrogenated Graphene Materials With Integrated Proton Radiation Shielding and Energy Storage Capability for Space Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent amorphous alumina&#8208;hydrogenated graphene (AHG) thin film is developed via a thermal&#8208;driven precipitation and crystallization of carbon species alongside the oxidation of aluminum on a nickel&#8208;copper alloy surface. This heterostructured AHG thin film demonstrates great potential for advancing commercial off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf products, serving both as proton radiation shields and energy storage devices in next&#8208;generation space electronics.








ABSTRACT
The development of adaptive material platforms that integrate proton radiation shielding with energy storage capabilities is critical for achieving both miniaturization and cost&#8208;effective reliability in space electronics. Here, we present an industrially viable technology for fabricating covalent amorphous alumina&#8208;hydrogenated graphene (AHG) films that can attenuate energetic protons, store electrical energy, and adapt to downsizing. Specifically, the fabrication involves thermal&#8208;driven precipitation and crystallization of carbon species into hydrogenated graphene layers, along with oxidation of aluminum into amorphous alumina, on a nickel&#8208;copper alloy surface. AHG films exhibit effective attenuation of energetic protons (15.2 MeV, 4.3 &#215; 1012 p/cm2), primarily attributed to proton trapping via C&#9472;H bond formation within the film matrix. Moreover, AHG films are laser&#8208;scribed into interdigitated electrodes for constructing micro&#8208;supercapacitors (&#181;&#8208;SCs) with impressive energy (8.33 mWh/cm3) and power (130&#160;mW/cm3) densities. Operando measurements of the AHG &#181;&#8208;SCs demonstrate their dual functions in reducing the incident protons by &#8764;1.9 MeV in energy and &#8764;5.8 &#215; 1011 protons/cm2 in fluence, while maintaining stable capacitive behavior with &#8764;93% capacitance retained after the severe irradiation. These findings suggest significant potential for developing single multifunctional products as a replacement for both traditional radiation shields and energy storage devices in next&#8208;generation space electronics.

         <title>Close and Enhance the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle by Engineered Dual&#8208;Targeted Nano&#8208;Adaptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;targeted nano&#8208;adaptor nanotechnology was designed to potentiate the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle (CIC). By leveraging the multimodality and programmability of this platform, the engineered nanomedicines complete the CIC by targeting five critical steps within the framework. The derived bispecific antibodies further amplify the CIC by enhancing cell&#8208;cell interactions. Their combination elicits robust antitumor immunity, effectively eliminating established tumors and inhibiting metastasis.








ABSTRACT
The cancer&#8208;immunity cycle (CIC) provides a conceptual framework for eliciting effective anti&#8208;tumor immune responses by targeting key events in systemic immunity. However, the successful completion of the CIC often requires the coordinated action of multiple therapeutic modalities, necessitating their integration into a unified system to overcome the limitations of conventional combination therapies. Here, we present a multimodal and programmable platform that integrates diverse therapeutic biomolecules into single agents, enabling the construction of versatile nanomedicines and bispecific antibodies through dual&#8208;targeted nano&#8208;adaptor (TNA) nanotechnology to potentiate the CIC. Specifically, TNA nanomedicines target five critical steps within the CIC, including antigen release, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, T&#8208;cell activation, mitigation of T&#8208;cell exhaustion, and tumor cell killing. Meanwhile, TNA bispecific antibodies enhance DC&#8208;T cell interactions to strengthen adaptive immunity and reinforce NK&#8208;tumor cell interactions to promote cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that TNAs elicit robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity, eradicating established tumors and suppressing metastatic dissemination. Owing to their modular and programmable architecture, TNAs hold broad potential for applications in immunotherapy and beyond.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area 2D Metasurface&#8208;Based Triboelectric E&#8208;Skin Arrays: Contact &amp; Proximity Tactile Mapping with Broadband Acoustic Readouts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurface&#8208;engineered NC&#8208;TENG arrays integrate tactile pressure mapping, non&#8208;contact gesture sensing, and acoustic signal readouts in one ultrathin module, and outperforms pristine PDMS in terms of electrical output and real&#8208;time spatial mapping for next&#8208;gen wearables.








ABSTRACT
Recent advances in electromechanically coupled, self&#8208;powered, flexible transducer&#8208;enabled electronic skins are predominantly driven by the capacitive triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), which operate intrinsically as multifunctional sensor&#8208;cum&#8208;energy harvester. The resulting TENG's operability in cutting&#8208;edge wearable technologies can be significantly augmented by introducing 2D dielectric metasurfaces, which optimize functionality through enhanced electromechanical coupling. Here, we introduce a 2D metasurface&#8208;TENG e&#8208;skin that unifies tactile (contact and inductive) and acoustic sensing in a single ultrathin platform. Large&#8208;area nanocone (NC) metasurfaces are engineered on 100&#160;&#181;m polydimethoxysilane (PDMS) films via laser&#8208;interference lithography (LIL) and soft molding, which boosts triboelectric charge density and provides optical diffraction cues for strain monitoring. Integrated into a 3 &#215; 3 array, the device delivers real&#8208;time tactile pressure imaging with low crosstalk and non&#8208;contact proximity detection. The NC&#8208;TENG patch also functions as a self&#8208;powered acoustic sensor, in which the sound pressure level (SPL) and frequency response are quantified in both spatial and spectral domains over a broad frequency range (&#8764;50&#8211;6400&#160;Hz). Compared to pristine PDMS, the metasurface enhances open&#8208;circuit voltage by &#8776;46% under identical loading and sustains stable electrical output. By coupling electromechanical and electro&#8208;acoustic transductions with metasurface optics, this work advances multimodal, arrayed e&#8208;skins for next&#8208;generation human&#8208;machine interfaces and wearable sensing.

         <title>Synaptic Functionality and Neuromorphic Information Processing in Membrane Ion Channel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematics of an artificial membrane ion channel synapse composed of aqueous droplets connected by embedded ion channels, emulating the function of biological synapses for neuromorphic ionic learning and computing.








ABSTRACT
The human brain performs complex memory and computational tasks with high energy efficiency by regulating ion transport through membrane channels. These signaling mechanisms have been inspiring the development of nanofluidic memristors that emulate synaptic behavior. Here, we describe a membrane ion channel synapse (MICS), constructed from aqueous droplets linked by gramicidin A channels, that achieves neuromorphic functionality. MICS exhibits memristive ion transport with hysteretic current&#8211;voltage behavior arising from voltage&#8208;dependent channel formation and ion transport dynamics. MICS emulates a range of synaptic behaviors including associative learning. We further demonstrate its application in reservoir computing by performing handwritten digit classification and tic&#8208;tac&#8208;toe game and explore the system parameters that improve the computational performance. This droplet&#8208;based biomimetic synapse offers a potentially scalable and energy&#8208;efficient platform for next&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing&#160;systems.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Powered Radiation Cooling/Heating for Advanced Thermal Management of Wound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective summarizes the application of solar&#8208;based radiative cooling and radiative heating technologies to promote wound healing. Specifically, radiative cooling technology accelerates healing through its anti&#8208;inflammatory effects and ability to stimulate cell proliferation. In contrast, radiative heating technology facilitates healing by enhancing cellular activity and increasing blood flow velocity, among other functions.








ABSTRACT
Active heating and cooling techniques are widely used in biological tissue regeneration. However, given the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability, heat exchange without additional energy input is receiving increasing attention. This Perspective examines the influence of temperature on wound healing and explores the potential of passive radiative cooling and passive radiative heating for thermal wound management. The advantages are highlighted, relevant application scenarios outlined, and current challenges identified, with the aim of proposing novel zero&#8208;energy wound treatment strategies for the biomedical field.

         <title>Elemental Selenium Phase&#8208;Change Material for Scalable Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Loss Programmable Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a low&#8208;loss elemental Se PCM with exceptional optical performance. Se exhibits a wide bandgap (&gt;1.8 eV) and a high figure of merit (FOM633 nm = 3.25). Se also demonstrates a robust switching ability (&gt;106 cycles) under laser&#8208;induced stimuli. Furthermore, we demonstrate an etching&#8208;free, fully reconfigurable platform based on Se for dynamic displays and vortex beam generation.








ABSTRACT
Chalcogenide phase&#8208;change photonics has revolutionized reconfigurable optics by enabling nonvolatile light&#8208;matter control. While low&#8208;loss phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) with near&#8208;zero extinction coefficients (k &#8776; 0) unlock ideal phase&#8208;only modulation, their growing compositional complexity hinders uniform fabrication and switching stability. Here, we introduce an elemental solution: wafer&#8208;scale (8&#8208;inch) selenium (Se) thin films achieving unprecedented uniformity, full near&#8208;infrared transparency, and ultralow losses across the visible range, meanwhile sustaining one million (106) reversible cycles without degradation. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the giant refractive index switching (&#916;n &#8776; 0.6) stems from the unique fracture&#8208;reconfiguration dynamics of Se helical chains. Furthermore, we demonstrate a manufacturable, etch&#8208;free platform with laser&#8208;reconfigurable patterns for dynamic image generation and Gaussian&#8208;vortex beam conversion. By harmonizing atomic simplicity with device&#8208;grade scalability, this elemental PCM establishes a new paradigm for high&#8208;performance programmable photonics.

         <title>Proton Provision&#8208;Conversion&#8208;Spillover Cascade Programming on Dual Supported Pt Atoms for Robust Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino&#8208;type proton cascade is engineered on a dual&#8208;support tip&#8208;platform consisting of TiN nanotips coated with an ultrathin porous N&#8208;doped carbon layer (Pt&#8208;NC1@TiN NWs). The architecture initiates a tip&#8208;distance&#8208;spillover domino effect at unsaturated Pt&#8208;N2 sites, driving a proton provision&#8208;conversion&#8208;spillover cascade during hydrogen evolution reaction.








ABSTRACT
Rational proton engineering offers a powerful strategy for enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). Notably, achieving concerted proton management across multiple reaction steps presents a highly efficient approach, yet it remains more challenging to implement than single&#8208;step regulation. Here, we propose a domino&#8208;type proton provision&#8208;conversion&#8208;spillover programming for Pt SACs in acidic HER, enabled by ultrathin porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (main 1&#8211;2 atomic layers, sub&#8208;1&#160;nm) encapsulated TiN nanowires with tips as dual&#8208;support tip&#8208;platform (Pt&#8208;NC1@TiN NWs). Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that this platform triggers tip&#8208;distance&#8208;spillover domino effects to drive a proton cascade throughout HER. Specifically, NC1@TiN nanotips induce tip&#8208;enhanced effect that promotes interfacial proton accessibility. Concurrently, the short&#8208;distance Pt/TiN vertical coupling optimizes electronic modulation of unsaturated Pt&#8208;N2 sites to enhance their intrinsic activity. Exposed TiN sites function as hydrogen spillover centers to facilitate H2 desorption. Consequently, Pt&#8208;NC1@TiN NWs achieve a superior Pt mass activity of 153.5 A/mgPt@&#8208;100&#160;mV, surpassing Pt/C by two orders of magnitude. Notably, it reaches 2 A/cm2 at low cell voltage of 1.75&#160;V and sustains stable operation at 1 A/cm2 for 1200&#160;h in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). This work indicates the potential of harnessing multi&#8208;step domino processes for advanced catalyst design.

         <title>Cu+&#8208;Driven Ferroionic Structure and Pressure&#8208;Tunable Magnetism in Layered Thiophosphate CuVP2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered CuVP2S6 is shown to host a ferroionic structure in which mobile Cu+ ions occupy multiple crystallographic sites and generate switchable polarization. This ionic configurational freedom couples to lattice distortion and magnetic anisotropy, enabling strong pressure&#8208;tunable interlayer exchange and enhanced ferromagnetism. The results establish ionic degrees of freedom as an effective handle for controlling magnetism in van der Waals materials.








ABSTRACT
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets offer a versatile platform to explore fundamental physics and low&#8208;dimensional functionalities. Metal thiophosphates (MTPs) with mobile Cu+ ions exhibit a ferroionic state, where polarization arises from ionic redistribution among multiple nearly degenerate sites. CuVP2S6 uniquely combines intrinsic ferromagnetism from the V sublattice with Cu+&#8208;driven ferroionic configurational freedom, enabling direct exploration of how ionic dynamics influence magnetic interactions. Herein, high&#8208;quality CuVP2S6 single crystals are synthesized, and their structural and physical properties are systematically investigated. Temperature&#8208;dependent neutron diffraction elucidates a ferroionic structure with dynamic distributions of copper ions across multiple crystallographic sites. The versatile occupations are driven by local symmetry&#8208;controlled orbital interactions between copper ions and surrounding ligands through a second&#8208;order Jahn&#8211;Teller mechanism. Magnetic measurements identify a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below 3.3&#160;K. The pressure&#8208;controlled magnetocrystalline anisotropy and interlayer exchange interactions mediated by Cu+ migration are demonstrated, boosting the Curie temperature remarkably by over 60% and inducing a soft&#8208;to&#8208;hard FM transition unparalleled within the MTP family. These results demonstrate that ionic configurational freedom provides an efficient route to control magnetism, opening new possibilities for spintronic applications.

         <title>Efficient Non&#8208;Invasive Rejuvenation of Spent Lithium Iron Phosphate Batteries Through Controlled Overdischarge</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This strategy rejuvenates spent lithium iron phosphate battery by non&#8208;invasively targeting Li+ trapped within the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This method mitigates copper dissolution and reduces Li/Fe antisite defects, achieving 9.56% capacity recovery and 214 cycles lifespan extension. The process requires only 3&#160;MJ&#160;kg&#8722;1 of energy and emitting 168&#160;g&#160;kg&#8722;1 of greenhouse gases per feedstock.








ABSTRACT
Recycling lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries presents critical economic and environmental challenges because of their low metal value and high energy intensity of conventional metallurgical processes. While direct recycling methods offer a pathway for lithium replenishment, they are often hindered by stringent impurity controls and complex operating conditions that limit scalability. Here, we introduce a controlled overdischarge (COD) protocol as a non&#8208;invasive strategy to rejuvenate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) batteries. COD selectively decomposes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, releasing trapped Li+ and reducing Li/Fe antisite defects while simultaneously suppressing copper dissolution. The COD protocol recovers 9.56% of lost capacity and extends lifespan by over 200 cycles. Furthermore, compared to metallurgical recycling, this method markedly lowers greenhouse gas emissions to 168&#160;g&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy consumption to 3&#160;MJ&#160;kg&#8722;1 of feedstock. These findings highlight COD as a sustainable and scalable alternative for S&#8208;LFP battery recycling.

         <title>Broadband Excitation of Antiferromagnetic Dynamics by Acoustic Phonons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate broadband excitation of incoherent magnons in layered antiferromagnet CrSBr using surface acoustic waves, bypassing the constraints of dispersion intersections. Driven by angular momentum transfer from acoustic phonons to magnons, the excitation efficiency is governed by the alignment between the phonon angular momentum and the N&#233;el vector, offering a broadband, low&#8208;loss route to manipulate antiferromagnetic dynamics.








ABSTRACT
Excitation of antiferromagnetic dynamics is at the core of ultrafast spintronics. Coherent excitation of antiferromagnetic magnons is typically monochromatic, confined at dispersion intersections between antiferromagnetic magnons and the excitation source. Broadband excitation can be enabled by introducing electron spins in an incoherent manner, albeit accompanied by high energy consumption from Joule heating. Here, we demonstrate a broadband excitation of antiferromagnetic dynamics of 2D antiferromagnet CrSBr without Joule heating, by Rayleigh&#8208;type surface acoustic wave (R&#8208;SAW). Incoherent magnons are efficiently excited via the angular momentum transfer from acoustic phonons, across a wide range up to the spin&#8208;flop field. The collinear alignment between the N&#233;el vector and phonon angular momenta induces strong excitation of magnons with high phonon dissipation, whereas orthogonal alignment suppresses dissipation, as revealed by R&#8208;SAW transmission. Our work uncovers a mutual interplay between phonon transport and antiferromagnetic order parameters, offering a broadband, low&#8208;loss route to manipulate antiferromagnetic dynamics.

         <title>CdS/ZnSe Quantum Dot Assembled Clusters vs. Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Rod: Charge Separation and Utilization for Efficient Photocatalytic NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contrary to widely accepted facts that long&#8208;lived charge separation favors higher photocatalytic efficiency, CdS and ZnSe quantum dot assembled clusters with slower charge separation achieve higher NH3 yield rate compared to ZnSe@CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rod. Kinetic studies corroborate that photocatalytic efficiency is determined by not only long&#8208;lived charge separation, but also efficient charge carrier utilization.








ABSTRACT
Photocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction with semiconductor nanocrystals has promising prospects for ammonia (NH3) synthesis, which typically relies on broad light absorption, efficient charge separation, and high surface reactivity. Represented herein is, however, contrary to the widely accepted facts that long&#8208;lived charge separation favors higher photocatalytic efficiency, i.e. ZnSe@CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods with better charge separation unexpectedly yield NH3 with much lower efficiency (4.10 mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1) than CdS/ZnSe assembled clusters (53.85 mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1). Mechanistic studies reveal that the intimate binding of ZnSe on CdS in dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods accelerates charge separation by 3 orders of magnitude, while the electron transfer from CdS to NO3&#8722; and the hole transfer from ZnSe to 1&#8208;phenylethanol proceed at 108 s&#8722;1. As a result, the comparable charge transfer rates in the assembled cluster of ZnSe and CdS quantum dots enable effective utilization of separated electrons and holes timely for photocatalytic NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 reaction, while the imbalance of fast charge separation and slow utilization of electrons and holes in dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods leads to inferior NH3 yield.

&lt;p&gt;Contrary to widely accepted facts that long-lived charge separation favors higher photocatalytic efficiency, CdS and ZnSe quantum dot assembled clusters with slower charge separation achieve higher NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate compared to ZnSe@CdS dot-on-rod. Kinetic studies corroborate that photocatalytic efficiency is determined by not only long-lived charge separation, but also efficient charge carrier utilization.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction with semiconductor nanocrystals has promising prospects for ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) synthesis, which typically relies on broad light absorption, efficient charge separation, and high surface reactivity. Represented herein is, however, contrary to the widely accepted facts that long-lived charge separation favors higher photocatalytic efficiency, i.e. ZnSe@CdS dot-on-rods with better charge separation unexpectedly yield NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with much lower efficiency (4.10 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) than CdS/ZnSe assembled clusters (53.85 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Mechanistic studies reveal that the intimate binding of ZnSe on CdS in dot-on-rods accelerates charge separation by 3 orders of magnitude, while the electron transfer from CdS to NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and the hole transfer from ZnSe to 1-phenylethanol proceed at 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. As a result, the comparable charge transfer rates in the assembled cluster of ZnSe and CdS quantum dots enable effective utilization of separated electrons and holes timely for photocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reaction, while the imbalance of fast charge separation and slow utilization of electrons and holes in dot-on-rods leads to inferior NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield. The kinetic balance for photocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-to-NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reaction offers valuable guidance for orchestrating multi-step photochemical events to realize elegant transformations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction and Microenvironment Regulation of Short Charge Transfer Tunnel at MOF/COF Heterointerfaces for Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;atom anchoring strategy was achieved by inserting monodentate ligands into UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2. Through the covalent condensation of UIO with TpPa&#8208;cof, an &#8220;electron reservoir&#8221; was inserted near the Pt active site. The microenvironment along this pathway could be further regulated by adjusting the position of functional groups on the ligand. The Cl group demonstrated the most effective regulatory effect, achieving H2 performance of 14.21 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








ABSTRACT
Raising electron transfer efficiency is a crucial issue in improving photocatalytic productivity. Herein, we propose a strategy for anchoring single atoms and the establishment of a short&#8208;distance electron transport pathway. By incorporating nitrogen&#8208;containing monodentate ligands into UIO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2, Pt single atom could be co&#8208;anchored by both the nitrogen atom and the vacant Zr&#8208;oxo cluster. Subsequently, the Pt&#8208;containing UIO was condensed with TpPa&#8208;1. Thereby, a molecular&#8208;level electron transfer pathway from TpPa to Pt has been established at the heterointerface between TpPa and UIO. By rationally adjusting the positions of the functional groups (&#8208;H, &#8208;Cl, and &#8208;OCH3) in the monodentate ligand, their involvement in the pathway was precisely regulated. They functioned as electron relays when positioned at the ortho&#8208;position of the amino group, thereby facilitating the electron delivery. Cl exhibited a more pronounced effect compared to OCH3, UPT&#8208;o&#8208;Cl achieved the maximum H2 yield of 14.21 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Mechanism calculations revealed that the groups located along the pathway would regulate the microenvironment of the constructed tunnels, resulting in a higher electron density and enhanced ability to adsorb H intermediates of the Pt sites. This research reports a strategy for precisely regulating the microenvironment adjacent to the active site, providing new insights into enhancing carrier mobility and utilization efficiency.

         <title>Bioinspired Engineered Virus&#8208;Mimetic Vesicles for Enhanced Cytosolic Delivery of STING Agonists Into Dendritic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;infectious, genome&#8208;free, high&#8208;fidelity DENV&#8208;mimetic VLP platform was developed to facilitate the efficient cytosolic delivery of CDN to DCs.








ABSTRACT
Effective delivery to dendritic cells (DCs) is crucial for the clinical translation of STING agonists, however, current cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) therapies are hindered by inefficient cytosolic delivery and off&#8208;target activation&#8208;induced T cell exhaustion. Here, a high&#8208;fidelity, dengue virus&#8208;mimetic platform (CDN@VLP) is engineered to leverage natural tropism for precise cytosolic release in immature DCs. Compared to conventional lipid nanoparticles, CDN@VLP enhances DC&#8208;specific uptake by 1.9&#8208;fold while reducing non&#8208;specific T cell internalization in tumors by 14.8&#8208;fold, achieving comparable antitumor efficacy at one&#8208;fortieth the dose of free CDN. Systematic screening identifies an optimal VLP subtype that improves targeted accumulation in type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s)&#8212;a subset essential for STING pathway activation&#8212;by 2.3&#8208;fold and amplifies durable type I interferon responses, resulting in a 12.8&#8208;fold increase in IFN&#8208;&#946; production. Transcriptomic analysis further reveals that CDN@VLP promotes cDC1 recruitment into tumors by enhancing the secretion of key chemokines (XCL1, CCL4, and CCL5), suggesting an additional mechanism of action. By mimicking viral tropism, the CDN@VLP platform establishes a paradigm for precision STING activation, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between potency and specificity in cDC1&#8208;targeted immunotherapy.

         <title>Coupling Pt Single&#8208;Atoms with Amorphous LDH Nanosheets as a High&#8208;Efficiency Sonosensitizer for Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sonosensitizer (Pt/a&#8208;LDH) is developed by coupling Pt single&#8208;atoms with amorphous CoMgMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide with rich defects. Through the coupling effect between Pt single&#8208;atoms and rich defects on a&#8208;LDH, the Pt/a&#8208;LDH achieves significantly improved singlet oxygen generation under US irradiation, resulting in excellent performance in sonodynamic&#8208;immuno synergistic therapy.








ABSTRACT
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) represents a minimally invasive alternative for cancer treatment. However, its efficacy is constrained by the insufficient reactive oxygen species generation of inorganic sonosensitizers due to wide bandgaps, rapid electron&#8208;hole recombination, and insufficient oxygen adsorption/activation. Herein, we report for the first time a novel sonosensitizer constructed by anchoring Pt single&#8208;atoms onto amorphous CoMgMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide (Pt/a&#8208;LDH) for high&#8208;efficiency sonodynamic immunotherapy. Through the synergy of defect engineering and single&#8208;atom modification, Pt/a&#8208;LDH achieves sharp bandgap reduction (from 2.4 to 0.6&#160;eV) and abundant defective environment, dramatically promoting charge separation and inhibiting electron&#8208;hole recombination (an inhibition rate of 89.8%). Moreover, the unique 2D structure and hydroxyl coordination environment of LDH yield ultrahigh single&#8208;atom loading efficiency and defect density, which significantly promote oxygen adsorption/activation, reduce reaction energy barrier (bond energy from 3.6 to 2.1&#160;eV), and accelerate reaction kinetics. Consequently, Pt/a&#8208;LDH achieves a significant enhancement in sonodynamic performance, generating singlet oxygen at 5.3 and 38.2 times that of CoMgMo&#8208;LDH and TiO2 sonosensitizer, respectively. In vivo assays demonstrate that polyethylene glycol&#8208;modified Pt/a&#8208;LDH induces robust immunogenic cell death, activates dendritic cell maturation, stimulates T&#8208;cell infiltration, and reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, offering a new paradigm for high&#8208;performance sonodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Nanoscale Colloids Engineering for Minimizing Efficiency Loss in Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formate anions stabilize perovskite colloids by increasing surface charge density, suppressing aggregation and reducing particle size to &#8764;30 nm. This enables homogeneous nucleation and scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, delivering negligible efficiency loss from small&#8208;area cells to mini&#8208;modules.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved significantly high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), approaching the performance of silicon&#8208;based solar cells. However, scaling up PSCs while maintaining high&#8208;efficiency remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a negligible efficiency loss in scalable PSCs by formate anions stabilized colloids. The formate anions enhance the charge density on colloidal surfaces, strengthening electrostatic repulsion and preventing particle aggregation. This significantly reduces colloidal size to around 30 nm and promotes homogeneous nucleation, allowing the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films from a small area to mini module size in ambient air. As a result, PSCs achieved PCEs of 24.30% (1 cm2) and 24.10% (12.6 cm2, 5 cm &#8201;&#215; &#8201;5&#8201;cm mini module), with negligible efficiency loss upon scaling. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest efficiency reported for mini&#8208;modules. Most importantly, the encapsulated mini module retained 95% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point tracking in ambient air.

As a result, PSCs achieved PCEs of 24.30% (1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 24.10% (12.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 5 cm &#8201;&#215; &#8201;5&#8201;cm mini module), with negligible efficiency loss upon scaling. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest efficiency reported for mini-modules. Most importantly, the encapsulated mini module retained 95% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point tracking in ambient air.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bulk Passivation of Molybdenum Trioxide Enables Inverted Organic Photovoltaics with Significantly Enhanced Stability under Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
While inverted OPVs degrade at the buried MoO3/photoactive materials contact, we introduce IPE into the active layer as a bulk passivator. The modified devices achieve a 19.06% efficiency and retain 87.5% efficiency after 170&#176;C/5&#160;h aging (control: 48.8%), and maintain &gt;80% efficiency after 500 thermal cycles (ISOS&#8208;T&#8208;3) and over 1,150&#160;h MPP tracking (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3).








ABSTRACT
While organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have achieved remarkable efficiencies, their practical deployment remains hindered by insufficient stability. Herein, we find that degradation is strongly associated with diffusion&#8208;driven intermixing and redox chemistry at the buried molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/photoactive materials contact region. To address this issue, we incorporate 1H&#8208;isoindole&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione, 2,2&#8217;&#8208;(oxydi&#8208;4,1&#8208;phenylene) bis[3a,4,7,7a&#8208;tetrahydro&#8208;(9CI)] (IPE) into the bulk heterojunction as a bulk passivator that interacts with diffusing MoO3 species by passivating oxygen vacancies in MoO3, thereby suppressing redox reactions between MoO3 and photoactive materials. The IPE&#8208;containing devices achieve a champion efficiency of 19.06% alongside exceptional thermal robustness, retaining 87.5% of their initial efficiency after thermal aging at 170&#176;C for 5 h (vs. 48.8% for control devices). Critically, under harsh environmental stressors, these devices maintain &gt;80% of their initial efficiency after 500 thermal cycles (&#8722;40&#176;C to 85&#176;C, &#8764;60% relative humidity, ISOS&#8208;T&#8208;3) and over 1150&#8208;h continuous maximum power point&#160;tracking under 1 Sun illumination (65&#176;C, &#8764;50% relative humidity, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3). This represents one of the highest stability levels reported for OPVs under the stringent ISOS&#8208;T&#8208;3 and ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;3 protocols. This work provides a generalizable bulk modification strategy to mitigate diffusion&#8208; and redox&#8208;driven degradation at buried contacts, paving the way for the practical deployment of stable, high&#8208;efficiency OPVs.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Curvature in Carbon for Improved Energy Release of Ammonium Perchlorate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;curvature carbon materials identified via machine learning and simulation can enhance the heat release and combustion performance of ammonium perchlorate.








ABSTRACT
The catalytic role of carbon curvature in the thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate (AP) remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study employs machine learning and density functional theory to expedite the screening of curved carbon materials for enhanced catalytic energy release from AP. High&#8208;curvature carbon nanotubes (H&#8208;CNTs) exhibit superior performance by tuning the carbon p&#8208;band center, which strengthens the adsorption of key intermediates of AP decomposition (e.g., HClO4). H&#8208;CNT lowers the AP decomposition temperature by 103.5&#176;C and dramatically amplifies heat release by a factor of 6.6 (increasing from 250.7 to 1898.5 J g&#8722;1). In addition, enhanced safety, increased maximum output pressure (from 5.9 to 135.3&#160;kPa) and a markedly improved combustion effect (ignition in just 2&#160;ms) are also observed with high&#8208;curvature CNTs. These findings underscore curvature as a critical design parameter and provide a geometry&#8208;electronic&#8208;activity framework for developing efficient catalysts in energetic materials.

         <title>Structural Modulation Enables Bright and Efficient Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cl Electroluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By a holistic structural modulation of Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cl perovskite nanocrystals, the first Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cl&#8208;based electroluminescence device with a broadband bluish&#8208;white emission was demonstrated, achieving a champion external quantum efficiency of 2.02% and a luminance of 3345&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which expands the Cu&#8208;based perovskite electroluminescence family for displays and lighting applications.








ABSTRACT
Cesium&#8211;copper&#8211;halide (Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;X) perovskites are potential substitutes to lead&#8208;halide perovskites for broadband electroluminescence (EL) in white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED)&#160;due to their non&#8208;toxicity and unique self&#8208;trapped exciton (STE) characters. Many efforts have been devoted to pushing up EL efficiencies of Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;I LED devices, while there is no report of EL based on their Cl&#8208;based counterparts yet. In this work, the EL of the Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cl nanocrystals (NCs) was first demonstrated by a holistic structural modulation, whose champion device reached an external quantum efficiency of 2.02% and a high luminance of 3345&#160;cd m&#8722;2. The efficient bluish&#8208;white EL was explored to collectively derive from the smooth film morphology, exciton inter&#8208;band transition, triplet STE behavior, and promising electron transport ability of the Cs&#8211;Cu&#8211;Cl NC film. Additionally, the potential photophysical process for the broadband emission was proposed, collectively expanding the Cu&#8208;based perovskite EL family for displays and lighting applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Urethra&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Platform for Modelling Fibrosis: 3D&#8208;Printing and Near&#8208;Field Electrospinning in BAM&#8208;Functionalized Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a biomimetic dual&#8208;layer urethra&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip by integrating 3D printing, near&#8208;field electrospinning, and bladder acellular matrix functionalization. By regulating dynamic perfusion at 4 mm/s, the platform accurately reproduces physiological shear stress, promoting oriented cell growth and phenotypic maintenance. Under TGF&#8208;&#946;1 induction, the system successfully recapitulates key pathological hallmarks of urethral stricture, including fibroblast activation and epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT), while validating the antifibrotic efficacy of Rapamycin. This innovative platform offers a robust, animal&#8208;alternative tool for mechanistic investigation and high&#8208;throughput drug screening in translational urological research. 








ABSTRACT
Urethral stricture, a prevalent urological disorder characterized by fibrosis of periurethral tissues, severely compromises urinary function and patient quality of life. Despite various clinical interventions, recurrence remains frequent, largely due to the lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models for mechanistic investigation and drug screening. Here, we present a biomimetic urethra&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform that integrates microfluidics, three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing, and near&#8208;field electrospinning to recapitulate the structural and biochemical complexity of the native urethra. The device features polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels coupled with a multilayered polycaprolactone (PCL) membrane, functionalized using a bladder acellular matrix (BAM)&#8211;gelatin bioink to emulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment. A bilayer microchamber configuration supports spatially organized coculture of fibroblasts and urothelial cells under dynamic perfusion, reproducing physiological shear stress and nutrient gradients. Under fibrotic stimulation by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1), the system faithfully mimicked fibroblast activation and epithelial injury, while rapamycin treatment effectively attenuated fibrotic responses, validating its potential for pharmacological testing. This urethra&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip provides a robust, reproducible, and cost&#8208;efficient platform for modeling urethral fibrosis and evaluating antifibrotic therapeutics. By bridging biofabrication, microfluidics, and tissue pathophysiology, this work establishes a versatile organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip model with significant implications for translational research and personalized regenerative medicine.

         <title>A 3D&#8208;Printed Piezoelectric Scaffold With Bio&#8208;Inspired Gradient and Dynamic Adaptation for Tendon Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a dynamically adaptive tendon repair scaffold. Its biomimetic lotus structure combines a fibroblast&#8208;resistant hydrophobic outer layer and a stem cell&#8208;adhesive hydrophilic inner layer. By tuning PHBV concentration, graded mechanical, piezoelectric, and degradable properties are achieved to respectively mitigate stress concentration, optimize electrical stimulation for inflammation control and remodeling, and ensure spatiotemporally synchronized regeneration. The scaffold minimizes infection and adhesion, promotes functional tendon repair, and meets biological and mechanical demands throughout healing.








ABSTRACT
Tendon regeneration requires materials that dynamically adapt to the healing stages, offering mechanical support, adhesion prevention, inflammation control, and collagen remodeling. We introduce a novel, dynamically adaptive piezoelectric hydrogel designed to address these requirements. The hydrogel features a bioinspired, anti&#8208;adhesive lotus structure to minimize fibroblast and protein adhesion, preventing postoperative complications. Furthermore, it incorporates rationally designed gradients in piezoelectricity, mechanical properties, and degradation rate. These gradients allow the hydrogel to dynamically match the evolving needs of tendon healing, providing adjustable mechanical, electrical stimulation, and controllable degradation. The hydrogel demonstrably reduces inflammation (downregulating TNF&#8208;&#945;), promotes M2 macrophage polarization, inhibits bacterial growth, and stimulates endogenous tendon regeneration. This regeneration is characterized by increased collagen I deposition, improved fiber alignment, and enhanced biomechanical properties. Transcriptomic analysis revealed upregulation of genes associated with mechanotransduction, tissue remodeling, and anti&#8208;inflammatory responses, alongside downregulation of fibrotic and oxidative stress pathways. This self&#8208;powered, multi&#8208;gradient scaffold represents a significant advancement in tendon tissue engineering, offering a promising strategy for tendinopathy treatment.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Tunable Thermal Conductivity in Largely Amorphous Polyolefin Fibers via Alignment&#8208;Induced Vibrational Delocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast, reversible, and recyclable thermal switch is realized using largely amorphous polyolefin fibers. Mechanical strain induces polymer chain alignment, which triggers vibrational delocalization, experimentally quantified via Raman spectroscopy, to open new heat transport channels. This mechanism enables continuous thermal conductivity tuning with high switching ratios and sub&#8208;second response times across a broad temperature range.








ABSTRACT
Developing fast, reversible, and recyclable thermal switches is essential to advance adaptive thermal management. Here, we present a strain&#8208;tunable thermal switch based on largely amorphous olefin block copolymer (OBC) fibers, achieving a continuous switching ratio above 2 over 1000 cycles, as well as very short response times below 0.22 s. Using Raman spectroscopy, we quantify vibrational delocalization with increasing strain and demonstrate its direct connection to the observed thermal conductivity changes. We show that unlike prior assumptions linking propagating heat carriers primarily to crystalline domains, alignment in amorphous systems can enable phonon&#8208;like modes that dominate transport. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to experimentally probe vibrational delocalization using Raman spectroscopy and to demonstrate that alignment alone can govern the dominant carrier in disordered polymers. These findings establish design strategies for fatigue&#8208;resistant, high&#8208;performance, and recyclable polymer thermal switches for advanced thermal energy transport&#160;applications.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Assembling of 2D Mxene onto Anisotropic Single&#8208;Crystal Metal Oxides for Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Overcoming random aggregation, Facet&#8208;Selective Electrostatic Assembly (FSEA) achieves site&#8208;specific integration of 2D MXenes onto 3D TiO2 supports. This electrostatic assembling creates optimized interface energy junctions that facilitate spatial charge transfer. The resulting facet&#8208;engineered heterostructures exhibit enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance shown in the activity plots, providing a robust pathway for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.








ABSTRACT
Designing composite photocatalytic systems with nanoscale precision is crucial. While conventional facet&#8208;selective photo&#8208;deposition successfully utilizes spherical co&#8208;catalysts, the directed deposition of pre&#8208;synthesized two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials onto specific facets remains extremely challenging. This work demonstrates an electrostatic assembly strategy for the precise deposition of 2D transition metal carbides (MXenes) onto anisotropic single&#8208;crystal semiconducting metal oxides. By precisely controlling the solution pH, we modulated the surface charge of the MXenes and the distinct crystallographic facets of the metal oxides, enabling selective deposition driven by electrostatic attraction. Negatively charged Mo4/3C MXenes were selectively deposited on the electron&#8208;rich (101) surface of TiO2 at pH 3, the (100) surface of Cu2O exposed at pH 11, and the (010) surface of BiVO4 at pH 1.5. The high facet selectivity was confirmed through a combination of advanced techniques, including electron microscopy, electron spectroscopy, and synchrotron&#8208;based spectromicroscopy. This selective interfacial engineering promotes spatially separated charge carrier migration toward distinct facets, while Schottky barriers form at the MXenes/oxides interfaces. The MXenes act as efficient reduction co&#8208;catalysts, facilitating the rapid consumption of electrons, thereby enhancing photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. This work establishes a generalizable, non&#8208;photolytic method for integrating challenging 2D co&#8208;catalysts with facet&#8208;engineered semiconductors for designing composite photocatalysts.

         <title>Falcon Vision&#8208;Inspired Ultrafast Traffic Obstacle Avoidance Based on 2D Edge&#8208;Rich van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Falcon Vision Sensor (FVS) capable of ultrafast perception for dynamic traffic scenarios has been developed. The sensor employs edge&#8208;rich SnS2/MoS2 heterostructures, where dense atomic&#8208;scale interfaces and defective edges enhance light&#8208;matter interaction and accelerate carrier dynamics. These structural advantages endow the FVS with synaptic plasticity, a high refresh rate (250 Hz), and intrinsic erasure behaviors, advancing multifunctional sensing devices for neuromorphic computing.








ABSTRACT
Ultrafast and reliable visual perception is essential for obstacle avoidance in autonomous driving, where split&#8208;second decisions must be made in complex, high&#8208;speed environments, yet remains constrained by the limited temporal resolution and processing latency of conventional devices. Here, inspired by the exceptional temporal resolution of falcon vision systems (&gt;150&#160;Hz), we develop a neuromorphic vision sensor capable of ultrafast, edge&#8208;selective perception for dynamic traffic scenarios. The sensor leverages vertically stacked, edge&#8208;rich SnS2/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructures, in which a high density of atomic&#8208;scale interfaces and defective edges enables enhanced light&#8208;matter interactions and rapid carrier dynamics. These structural advantages endow the Falcon Vision Sensor (FVS) with synaptic plasticity (PPF = 201%, LTP = 1300s), high refresh rate (250&#160;Hz), and intrinsic erasure behaviors, closely mimicking the temporal precision and motion discrimination features of falcon vision. When the synaptic devices are integrated with computing modules, the system achieves real&#8208;time obstacle detection, along with a directional motion recognition accuracy of 98.89%. This work demonstrates a robust biologically inspired visual intelligence, offering a compact, low&#8208;latency solution for next&#8208;generation autonomous vehicles and edge AI applications requiring rapid environmental responsiveness.

         <title>Construction of Quinazoline&#8208;Bridged Donor&#8208;Acceptor Covalent Organic Frameworks for Photocatalytic Sulfoxide Synthesis from Alkenes and Thiols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8208;A type quinazoline&#8208;bridged pyrene&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks with different pi&#8208;conjugation extents were synthesized and utilized as efficient photocatalysts for the selective synthesis of sulfoxides from styrenes and thiols.








ABSTRACT
As an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, COFs have attracted increasing attention in fields such as photocatalysis. Understanding how the linkage chemistry of COFs influences their construction and photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, two quinazoline&#8208;linked COFs are assembled by the condensation of 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetra (4&#8208;formylphenyl) pyrene (TFPPy) with 3,3'&#8208;dibenzoyl&#8208;[1,1'&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4,4'&#8208;diamine (BD(Bz)) and 3,3'&#8208;dibenzoyl&#8208;4,4'&#8208;terphenyl diamine (BT(Bz)) respectively through a three&#8208;component reaction in the presence of an ammonia source. By integrating quinazoline linkage with pyrene structural unit, BD(Bz)&#8208;TFPPy&#8208;COF (COF&#8208;1b) and BT(Bz)&#8208;TFPPy&#8208;COF (COF&#8208;2b) exhibit electron donor&#8208;acceptor properties and possess high chemical stability as well, which demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance for the selective synthesis of sulfoxides from alkenes and thiols. Incorporation of linkage chemistry and building blocks selection of COFs provides effective strategies for modulating its optoelectronic properties to improve photocatalytic performance.

&lt;p&gt;As an emerging class of crystalline porous materials, COFs have attracted increasing attention in fields such as photocatalysis. Understanding how the linkage chemistry of COFs influences their construction and photoelectrochemical properties and photocatalytic performance remains a significant challenge. Herein, two quinazoline-linked COFs are assembled by the condensation of 1,3,6,8-tetra (4-formylphenyl) pyrene (TFPPy) with 3,3'-dibenzoyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4,4'-diamine (BD(Bz)) and 3,3'-dibenzoyl-4,4'-terphenyl diamine (BT(Bz)) respectively through a three-component reaction in the presence of an ammonia source. By integrating quinazoline linkage with pyrene structural unit, BD(Bz)-TFPPy-COF (COF-1b) and BT(Bz)-TFPPy-COF (COF-2b) exhibit electron donor-acceptor properties and possess high chemical stability as well, which demonstrated excellent photocatalytic performance for the selective synthesis of sulfoxides from alkenes and thiols. Incorporation of linkage chemistry and building blocks selection of COFs provides effective strategies for modulating its optoelectronic properties to improve photocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Liver Tissueoid on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip Modeling Liver Regeneration and Allograft Rejection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascularized human liver tissueoid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip is engineered from donor&#8208;derived liver cells and maintained for 49 days under continuous perfusion. The system self&#8208;organizes into liver&#8208;like structures, supports long&#8208;term metabolic function, and responds to immune challenges from T cells and antibodies, enabling human&#8208;specific studies of liver regeneration and allograft rejection in vitro.








ABSTRACT
The lack of physiologically relevant in vitro models remains a limitation in liver transplantation research. Progress in organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip technologies enables the generation of clinically translatable data in vitro. A vascularized liver tissueoid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (LToC) model is engineered to replicate human liver tissue's structural and functional features for modeling liver regeneration and allograft rejection. The LToC comprises a microfluidic device containing donor&#8208;matched human hepatic progenitor cells and intrahepatic portal vein endothelial cells embedded in a fibrin matrix and maintained in dynamic culture for 49 days. The system supports self&#8208;assembly into a perfusable microvascular network and liver lobule&#8208;like architecture, with &gt;95% cell viability, stable vascular integrity, and active hepatic function (albumin, urea, complement factors, and hepatocyte growth factor secretion). The mature tissueoid includes hepatocytes (CK18+, albumin+, CYP2D6+), cholangiocytes (CK19+, EPCAM+), Kupffer cells (CD68+), stellate cells (PDGFR&#8208;&#946;+), and endothelial cells (CD31+). Perfusion with allogeneic T cells induces cellular rejection, characterized by decreased viability, endothelial disruption, hepatic marker loss, HLA&#8208;I upregulation, and a proinflammatory cytokine response (IL&#8208;6, TNF&#8208;&#945;, IL&#8208;1&#946;, IFN&#8208;&#947;, granzyme A and B, and perforin). The LToC provides a physiologically relevant platform for studying immune&#8208;mediated liver injury, tissue regeneration, and allograft rejection, with potential applications in immunosuppressive drug testing and personalized transplant medicine.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Nanoreactor With Hetero&#8208;Coordinated Fe&#8211;P&#8211;Co Bridges for Whole&#8208;Pathway&#8208;Regulated Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired Co&#8208;doped Fe2P on N&#8208;doped carbon with a hierarchical eucalyptus&#8208;like nanoarchitecture is engineered to regulate oxygen across the entire electrochemical pathway, achieving a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.938 V vs. RHE, sustaining 373 h of discharge in Al&#8208;air batteries, and delivering an energy density of 3487 Wh/kg.








ABSTRACT
Efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) requires coordination of oxygen adsorption, transport, and catalysis at active sites. Yet most studies address only one step, overlooking whole&#8208;pathway O2 regulation and thus limiting performance. Here, we report a bioinspired Co&#8208;doped Fe2P on N&#8208;doped carbon featuring a hierarchical eucalyptus&#8208;like nanoarchitecture, engineered to regulate oxygen throughout the electrochemical cycle, where Fe&#8211;P&#8211;Co hetero&#8208;coordinated bridges anchored to the carbon substrate through Fe&#9472;N bonds induce strong electronic coupling and polarization. The hierarchical structure generated local electric fields that enriched OH&#8722; and O2, while multilevel porosity accelerated oxygen transport. This enabled coordinated optimization of oxygen adsorption, transfer, and active&#8208;site electronic configuration. This nanohybrid achieved a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.938&#160;V vs. RHE, sustained discharge in Al&#8208;air batteries for 373 h, and delivered an energy density of 3487&#160;Wh/kg. Theoretical simulations revealed that Co&#8208;doping shortened Fe&#9472;P bonds and tuned the Fe electronic environment, lowering the d&#8208;band center and weakening Fe 3d&#8208;O 2p interactions, which reduced the *OH desorption barrier and accelerated ORR kinetics. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed that Fe&#8211;P&#8211;Co bridges served as active centers facilitating *OH release during ORR. These findings indicate that integrating hierarchical architecture, hetero&#8208;coordinated Fe&#8211;P&#8211;Co bridges, and electronic&#8208;state modulation enables whole&#8208;pathway O2 management for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis.

         <title>Multifunctional Liquid Metal&#8211;2D Material Composites: Structural Design, Properties, and Applications in Advanced Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal (LM)&#8211;2D material composites combine the high conductivity and fluidity of LM with the anisotropic properties and rich surface chemistry of 2D materials, enabling multifunctional performance in advanced electronics. This review summarizes recent advances in modification, structure, properties, and subsequently discusses current challenges and future prospects for next&#8208;generation multifunctional LM&#8211;2D material composites.








Abstract
The rapid advancement of high&#8208;integration electronics demands materials that unify thermal, electrical, and mechanical functionalities. Liquid metals (LMs) exhibit exceptional conductivity and self&#8208;healing capabilities, but their intrinsic fluidity poses leakage risks. Incorporation with 2D materials yields LM&#8211;2D material composites with enhanced structural stability and multifunctional integration. This review systematically summarizes: 1) interfacial enhancement strategies (oxidation, heterometallic doping, polymer grafting, mechanochemistry) to improve wettability and dispersion; 2) representative structural designs, including blended, core&#8211;shell, layered, and 3D networks supported by elastomers or hydrogels; 3) key properties across different structural types, such as mechanical robustness, thermal conductivity, and electrical conductivity; 4) multifunctional applications enabled by enabled by property synergy, spanning thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (thermal management), electrical&#8211;mechanical coupling (electromagnetic interference shielding, wearable sensors, and energy storage electrodes), and electrical&#8211;thermal&#8211;mechanical coupling (multifunctional films). Despite significant progress, critical challenges remain in scalable fabrication, long&#8208;term reliability, and efficient recycling. To address these challenges, this review further discusses emerging directions for LM&#8211;2D material composites, including novel composite systems, responsive smart materials, multiscale manufacturing technologies, and AI&#8208;assisted design, aiming to provide a roadmap for their development in next&#8208;generation electronic applications.

         <title>Leveraging Polymeric Design for Marine Anti&#8208;Biofouling: Mechanism, System, and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in marine antifouling polymeric materials and interfaces&#8212;including chemical and physical dynamic coatings, fouling&#8208;release coatings, fouling&#8208;resistant coatings, and other emerging strategies&#8212;have been summarized. This review offers insights into the current state of marine antifouling coatings and aims to inspire the development of durable, sustainable, and non&#8208;toxic materials with excellent antifouling performance.








Abstract
Marine biofouling presents major challenges for marine industries, leading to substantial economic losses and increased energy consumption. Historically, antifouling strategies relied on coatings containing tributyltin (TBT) or metal&#8208; and organic&#8208;based biocides. While effective, these coatings pose considerable environmental and biological risks, highlighting the need for sustainable and non&#8208;toxic alternatives. Recent advances in polymer science have opened new avenues for environmentally friendly antifouling solutions. Various approaches such as dynamic coatings (chemical and physical), fouling&#8208;release coatings, fouling&#8208;resistant coatings, and other emerging strategies leveraging polymeric design to prevent organism attachment have been developed. Yet, comprehensive and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overviews focusing specifically on their design from a polymer science perspective remain limited. This review first summarizes recent progress in marine antifouling polymeric materials and interfacial designs, focusing on the relationship between polymer structure and functional performance. It then discusses the current challenges associated with these materials and proposes potential solutions for further development. Finally, the review outlines possible directions for future progress in the field, aiming to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of marine antifouling polymeric materials and interfaces while inspiring continued research and innovation in sustainable, durable, and non&#8208;toxic antifouling coatings.

         <title>Bioinspired Color&#8208;Changing Polymeric Hydrogel Actuators/Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives an in&#8208;depth overview of color&#8208;changing polymeric hydrogel actuators/robots by classifying them into three categories based on the color&#8208;changing mechanism (pigment, structural, and fluorescence color), with a particular focus on the preparation strategies, bifunctional synergistic performances, and demonstrated applications.








Abstract
Many natural creatures exhibit remarkable control over their morphologies and skin colors for better adaptability in dynamic living environments, which has inspired the emergence of biomimetic color&#8208;changing soft actuators/robots. Polymeric hydrogels are ideal candidate materials owing to their extremely biological similarity such as soft wet nature and tissue&#8208;like modulus. The past 5 years have witnessed the flourishing development of synergistic color&#8208;changing polymeric hydrogel actuators/robots with huge application potentials in camouflage, locomotion, information encryption and so on. This review is intended to give an in&#8208;depth overview of this flourishing research area by classifying them into three categories based on the mechanism of color origination (pigment color, structural color, and fluorescence color). Their typical preparation strategies, synergistic multicolor&#8208;shifting and 3D shape&#8208;morphing performances, as well as demonstrated applications are thoroughly summarized. Current challenges and future prospects on synergistic shape/color&#8208;polymeric hydrogels will also be discussed to attract more research interests.

         <title>Advances and Insights in Electrocatalytic Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate Plastic Wastes</title>

Overview of advanced electrocatalyst design, structure&#8208;activity relationship, and reaction mechanism toward the EGOR during the recycling of PET wastes.








Abstract
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most commonly used polyester plastics; however, its still&#8208;low recycling rate results in large amounts of waste emissions that pose a great threat to the ecosystem and human health. Electrocatalysis provides an effective strategy to convert waste PET plastics into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals under mild conditions, which can achieve enhanced recycling efficiency. Especially, when coupled with cathode reduction reactions such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrate reduction, etc., valuable chemicals can be concurrently produced at both anode and cathode. The corresponding coupling systems and their applicable electrocatalysts in the recycling process of PET waste have yet to be comprehensively reviewed. This review first describes the mechanisms of electrocatalytic PET upcycling in detail, and summarizes the electrochemical reforming strategies by emphasizing various anode&#8208;cathode reaction coupling pathways and related intermediates. Then, the most recent advances in developing highly active electrocatalysts in different&#8208;coupled systems, as well as typical product separation approaches of PET hydrolysate, are discussed to provide insights into innovative design principles. Finally, perspectives and outlooks are presented for electrocatalytic recycling of PET wastes, which is expected to benefit future developments of related fields, especially the electrocatalyst design toward practical application.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Piezocatalytic Water Splitting by Post&#8208;Synthetic Charge&#8208;Transfer Complexation Driven Cluster Modification in Ce&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808</title>

A unique design of a photo&#8208;piezocatalyst is showcased by post&#8208;synthetically modifying Ce&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 with a charge&#8208;transfer (CT) complex. This CT complex enabled efficient light harvesting and induced a mixed&#8208;valence Ce&#8308;&#8314;/Ce3&#8314; state, leading to local symmetry breaking and piezoelectric polarization. The resulting piezopotential generation in the MOF facilitated the promotion of charge separation upon photoexcitation. The synergy of light absorption and piezoelectric polarization resulted in an ultrahigh H2 generation rate by overall water splitting, which is the highest photo&#8208;piezocatalytic rate known to date.








Abstract
The production of green H2 fuel by photocatalytic water splitting has emerged as a potential solution to mitigate challenges related to the energy crisis. The inherent electric field generated within piezoelectric materials under mechanical stress offers a promising avenue for enhancing charge separation in photocatalysis through piezo&#8208;phototronic effect. Herein, we develop a photo&#8208;piezocatalyst leveraging [Ce6(&#181;3&#8208;O)4(&#181;3&#8208;OH)4(HCOO)6]6+ cluster modification via post&#8208;synthetic multistep integration of a donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8208;A) dyad within Ce&#8208;based MOF&#8208;808 (Ce&#8208;MOF). This supramolecular D&#8208;A charge transfer (CT) complex inside the confined nanopore of Ce&#8208;MOF functions as an efficient light&#8208;harvesting unit. Concomitantly, light&#8208;mediated electron transfer from the CT complex, results in a mixed valence Ce4+/Ce3+ state&#160; which creates local distortion within the Ce&#8208;oxo cluster, transitioning it from an ideal cubic state to a non&#8208;centrosymmetric configuration, giving rise to piezoelectric polarization. The synergistic interplay between piezoelectric polarization and enhanced CT driven light&#8208;harvesting capabilities culminates in an ultrahigh H2 production with a rate of 12.7&#160;mmol g&#8722;1h&#8722;1, achieved through overall water splitting under photo&#8208;piezocatalytic conditions. This work not only highlights the immense potential of MOFs as efficient catalysts for water splitting but also paves the way for harnessing both solar and mechanical energy through photo&#8208;mediated piezocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Supramolecular Zwitterionic Gels for Skin&#8208;Inspired Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initiator&#8208;free supramolecular gelation technology has been developed to enable the spontaneous polymerization gelation of zwitterionic monomers via Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This approach biomimetically realizes a soft ionic material with ultra&#8208;low modulus and ultra&#8208;high conductivity, meanwhile achieving force&#8208;electricity decoupling for signal sensing and robot control applications at biological ionic interfaces.








Abstract
Conventional synthetic skin for intelligent soft robotics typically relies on thermally or UV&#8208;initiated polymerization, making initiator&#8208;free rapid gelation a persistent challenge. Here, a supramolecular Lewis acid&#8211;base gelation strategy that enables facile, initiator&#8208; and crosslinker&#8208;free synthesis of polyzwitterionic gels is presented. Strong hydrogen bonding between urea (hydrogen bond donor, HBD) and the zwitterionic moieties of 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC; polymerizable zwitterionic hydrogen bond acceptor, PZHBA) drives spontaneous polymerization, establishing a general platform for zwitterionic gelation in deep eutectic solvents (DESs), such as choline chloride (ChCl) and urea. Inspired by the structural and ionic complexity of human skin, zwitterionic supramolecular eutectogel (ZSE) is designed via copolymerization of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) and MPC in DES, yielding a bioinspired ion&#8211;hydrogen bond dynamic network. These gels exhibit tunable mechanical properties, including an ultralow Young's modulus (5&#8211;180 kPa), and exceptionally high ionic conductivity (2 S&#183;m&#8722;1), which arises from the solvation of zwitterionic groups. The dynamic supramolecular network also imparts recyclability and intrinsic self&#8208;adhesion. ZSEs can be continuously spun into highly sensitive strain sensors with environmental robustness for integration into textiles. Additionally, bio&#8208;optimized gel patches demonstrate excellent antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. This work offers a sustainable and versatile synthetic platform for next&#8208;generation soft iontronics and bioinspired human&#8208;machine interfaces.

This work demonstrates electrically tunable friction &#8220;from sticky to slippery&#8221; using ionic hydrogels, achieving reversible more&#8208;than&#8208;fifty&#8208;fold modulation without liquid lubricants. An electric field extracts a salt&#8208;rich interfacial layer that dramatically reduces friction. This mechanism powers the first crawling robot and high&#8208;precision manipulation driven solely by electrotunable friction, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive robotic systems.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time regulation of friction from conventional dry states to ultra&#8208;low levels represents a critical strategy for improving energy efficiency and enabling the intelligent design of adaptive systems. Yet, current friction&#8208;control methods typically achieve only modest modulation and often rely on liquid lubricants at macroscopic scales, which impose stringent sealing requirements and limit practical applications. Here, an electric&#8208;field strategy is reported for friction modulation using a polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based ionic hydrogel as an electroresponsive frictional material. During sliding against a metal ball, the friction coefficient (COF) can be reversibly modulated by more than fifty&#8208;fold&#160;under low voltage control (&#8722;30&#160;V to +30&#160;V), without the need for external lubricants. Remarkably, the COF decreases to 0.03 at &#8722;30&#160;V (with the metal ball connected to the negative pole), while at 0&#160;V or +30&#160;V it increases to 1&#8211;2. Mechanistic analyses reveal that positive charging of the ionic hydrogel triggers electroosmotic extraction of a salt&#8208;rich interfacial layer, driving the dramatic reduction in friction. It further demonstrates the first crawling robot and precision robotic arm manipulation powered by electrotunable friction, establishing a new paradigm for adaptive and energy&#8208;efficient robotic and mechanical systems.

         <title>Dimensionally Resolved Nanostructures of an Atomically Precise and Optically Active 1D van der Waals Helix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ability to grow nanostructures based on inorganic helical crystals with long&#8208;range order will enable a platform to realize physical states that arise from chirality. Herein, it is demonstrated that controlled vapor phase deposition of an atomically precise helical crystal, GaSI, into ultrathin 1D nanowires and quasi&#8208;2D nanoribbons. The nanostructures retain the helical and noncentrosymmetric nature of the bulk, absorb in the UV, and manifest nonlinear optical activity.








Abstract
Inorganic freestanding helices are rare and sought&#8208;after for their unusual physical states endowed by chirality. To this end, III&#8211;VI&#8211;VII solids have emerged as a distinct class of ternary 1D van der Waals (vdW) crystals which bear atomically precise helical motifs. However, the physical understanding of the intrinsic and size&#8208;dependent properties of these materials is limited by the lack of synthetic strategies to directly access freestanding nanocrystals in high volumes. Using GaSI as a representative phase, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is presented to grow high yields of ultrathin nanostructures based on this helical materials class. With this strategy, it is possible to grow single crystals of 1D nanowires with thicknesses in the 10&#8211;100&#160;nm range at high temperature conditions, as well as quasi&#8208;2D nanoribbons at lower temperatures. The bandgap of the nanowires is established in the UV region and demonstrates the persistence of nonlinear optical behavior as evidence of the persistence of the noncentrosymmetric crystal structure of GaSI at the nanoscale. Inspired by these results, the effect of the helical nature of GaSI on the electronic structure of hypothetical single chains is probed from first principles and shows the pronounced handedness&#8208;dependent and helicity&#8208;imposed spin polarization at the single helix regime.

         <title>A Wearable, Dual Closed&#8208;loop Insulin Delivery System for Precision Diabetes Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable dual closed&#8208;loop drug delivery system for diabetes management is presented, featuring an adaptive, on&#8208;body trained edge AI algorithm for precise insulin delivery, which enhances therapeutic accuracy from 92.10% to 98.82%. 








Abstract
Effective blood glucose management is an increasing demand worldwide. Traditional solutions separate glucose detection and insulin delivery, which is less efficient compared to emerging closed&#8208;loop wearable systems controlled by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGM&#8208;controlled systems raise new safety risks, as false CGMs readings can cause insulin overdose, which results in hypoglycemia and fatal consequences. This work proposes a concept of a dual closed&#8208;loop insulin delivery system (DuoLoop) to mitigate the risk issue of CGM&#8208;controlled systems. The first closed&#8208;loop is automated insulin delivery controlled by CGM. The second closed&#8208;loop is the controlled release of glucose&#8208;responsive insulin (GRI), whose release rate depends on actual glucose levels. A customized algorithm is trained and embedded into the wearable CGMs for edge computing. The DuoLoop system shows improved safety in preliminary in vivo test&#160;(longer normoglycemia durations, 98.82% vs 92.10%), encouraging its deployment toward precision diabetes care.

         <title>Shutting Down the &#8216;Language Encoder&#8217;: A Pathogen&#8208;Derived Nano&#8208;Interferer Disrupt Sialylation Metabolism and Reprogram Intercellular Communication in Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma (GBM) exploits aberrant membrane sialylation to establish a &#8216;language encoder&#8217; that translates metabolic states into glycan&#8208;mediated intercellular communication, enhancing signaling plasticity and immune evasion. This study introduces a metabolism&#8208;guided nano&#8208;interferer (OMV@HM&#8208;T/F) that crosses the BBB, suppresses the encoder by blocking glycosylation precursor synthesis and sialic acid activation, and remodels membrane glycans to restrain GBM malignancy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), constrained by the limited cranial space and the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), establishes a rapidly adaptable, generalized communication network through enhanced terminal sialylation of membrane proteins. This metabolism&#8208;driven network encodes cellular metabolic states into functional information at the membrane level, thereby markedly enhancing signaling plasticity, intercellular communication, and immune evasion, which together sustain and expand malignant phenotypes within a resource&#8208;limited microenvironment. Here, a &#8220;metabolism&#8208;guided decoding of communication architecture&#8221; strategy is proposed and developed a brain&#8208;targeted pathogen&#8208;derived nano&#8208;interferer (OMV@HM&#8208;T/F). By simultaneously inhibiting glycosylation precursor synthesis and sialic acid activation, the platform remodels membrane glycan structures, disrupts glycan&#8208;dependent communication scaffolds, and effectively blocks downstream signal amplification and immune suppression pathways. Integrating BBB penetrability with tumor microenvironment responsiveness, this strategy enables precise metabolic&#8208;level intervention, offering a promising approach to overcoming high adaptability and therapeutic resistance.

         <title>Meticulous Construction of Internal Encapsulation Layer via In Situ Self&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linking Polymerization and Ring&#8208;Opening Addition Reactions for Efficient and Environmental Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An internal encapsulation layer (GPTFP) is developed via self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking polymerization and ring&#8208;opening addition reactions to resolve the deterioration influences of byproducts, the tradeoff between perovskite quality and Pb2+ leakage, achieving 26.83% efficiency inverted devices with over 2000 h operational stability.








Abstract
Capping an internal encapsulation layer (IEL) on the top surface of perovskite plays significant roles in enhancing perovskite quality and achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Herein, a novel IEL is in situ synthesized by self&#8208;cross&#8208;linking polymerization of siloxane motifs and ring&#8208;opening addition of ethylene oxide groups to overcome the long&#8208;overlooked drawbacks of IEL, such as eliminating deterioration influences of byproducts, as well as the tradeoff between improving perovskite quality and minimizing Pb2+ leakage. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that amidogen, hydroxyl, and carbon&#8208;fluorine (C&#9472;F) bond in GPTFP synergistically stabilize grain boundaries, passivate surface defects, block oxygen and moisture, as well as minimize the Pb2+ leakage of perovskite through hydrogen bond, oxygen&#8211;lead, fluorine&#8211;lead, and hydrophobic interactions. The resultant perovskite exhibits enhanced crystallinity quality, relieved residual strain, air&#8208;stable black phase retained after 200 days of ambient aging, and undetectable leakage of Pb2+ under simulated harsh conditions. Consequently, the resultant inverted device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.83% (certified 26.57%) with a certified quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state output of 26.51%. Notably, such a device retains &gt;93 % of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 2000&#160;h of ambient storage (30&#177;5% relative humidity, 25&#160;&#176;C), respectively.

Herein, a novel IEL is in situ synthesized by self-cross-linking polymerization of siloxane motifs and ring-opening addition of ethylene oxide groups to overcome the long-overlooked drawbacks of IEL, such as eliminating deterioration influences of byproducts, as well as the tradeoff between improving perovskite quality and minimizing Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leakage. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that amidogen, hydroxyl, and carbon-fluorine (C&#9472;F) bond in GPTFP synergistically stabilize grain boundaries, passivate surface defects, block oxygen and moisture, as well as minimize the Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leakage of perovskite through hydrogen bond, oxygen&#8211;lead, fluorine&#8211;lead, and hydrophobic interactions. The resultant perovskite exhibits enhanced crystallinity quality, relieved residual strain, air-stable black phase retained after 200 days of ambient aging, and undetectable leakage of Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; under simulated harsh conditions. Consequently, the resultant inverted device achieves an excellent efficiency of 26.83% (certified 26.57%) with a certified quasi-steady-state output of 26.51%. Notably, such a device retains &amp;gt;93 % of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous 1-sun illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 2000&#160;h of ambient storage (30&#177;5% relative humidity, 25&#160;&#176;C), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Elastomeric Agent to Addressing Embrittlement in High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The brittleness of high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor&#8208;based organic solar cells hinders wearable applications. A commercial SEEPS elastomer is introduced as a general toughening additive that boosts mechanical robustness without sacrificing efficiency. Guided by a toughening parameter for material selection, this work achieved a record efficiency surpassing 16% with an 11&#8208;fold increase in fracture strain and exceptional performance retention under extreme deformation.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) that combine high photovoltaic efficiency with mechanical resilience are critical for wearable devices. However, prevalent acceptors often act as stress concentrators, leading to film embrittlement. A general toughening approach remains elusive. Here, a broadly applicable strategy is introduced using SEEPS, an elastomeric agent with finely&#8208;tailored miscibility with the acceptor to toughen OSCs. A toughening parameter &#951;, derived from dynamic mechanical analysis is defined, that quantitatively correlates with elastomer&#8208;acceptor miscibility with mechanical enhancement. SEEPS induces pronounced secondary relaxations that dissipate strain energy, yielding an over 11&#8208;fold increase in fracture strain. In situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray scattering reveals that SEEPS preserves molecular packing and suppresses phase separation under strain. The resulting intrinsically stretchable OSCs retain four&#8208;fifths of starting efficiency after 500 stretch&#8208;release cycles at 40% strain, and sustain its four&#8208;fifths efficiency at 52% strain. This work achieves record&#8208;breaking efficiency over 16% while preserving exceptional mechanical stretchability, offering insights for high&#8208;performance stretchable photovoltaics.

         <title>A Labor&#8208;Division Cooperation Electronic Palm System for High&#8208;Precision Crosstalk&#8208;Free Cognition of Pressure and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a novel biomimetic electronic palm system (BEPS), which solves the issues of crosstalk and low integration in existing sensing methods. Demonstrations show that the mechanical hand can detect water temperature, water level, and determine the softness and shape of objects. By integrating the neural hand contraction reflex, the BEPS achieves closed&#8208;loop control and feedback for hot and cold objects.








Abstract
Current methods for pressure and temperature sensing face issues such as crosstalk, low integration, and difficulty in achieving large&#8208;scale arrays. These problems significantly impact the practical application value of multifunctional biomimetic sensors in intelligent biomimetic robots. Herein, this paper presents a novel multifunctional biomimetic electronic palm system (BEPS) consisting of 16 bimodal decoupling biomimetic electronic skins (e&#8208;skin). By subtly introducing vertical stacking design and in situ photopolymerization and 3D printing technologies&#8208;based fabrication, large&#8208;scale arrays integration with high sensing performances is constructed. Furthermore, a universal decoupling calculation model is developed, achieving crosstalk&#8208;free sensing of temperature and pressure. To demonstrate the practical application value of the proposed biomimetic palm, three implemented demonstration applications in this paper show that the mechanical hand has the ability to detect water temperature and water level, as well as to confirm the softness and shape of grasped objects. The BEPS system combines neural hand contraction reflexes to achieve closed&#8208;loop control and feedback when dealing with hot and cold objects. This progress has enormous potential in enhancing the functionality and adaptability of robotic systems.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Control of MOF Reconstruction Unlocks Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a spatiotemporally decoupled reconstruction strategy to engineer a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;node metal&#8208;organic frameworks&#160;catalyst, in which orbitally coupled pore&#8208;microenvironments drive time&#8208;phased kinetic reconstruction of the spatially separated Fe/Ni metal nodes, creating a foundational platform to lay bare the mechanisms governing the reconstruction processes and the cross&#8208;scale kinetic. 








Abstract
Understanding the dynamical reconstruction mechanisms of the active phase in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) during the course of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is central to the development of efficient and durable OER catalysts, but remains elusive till present. Herein, a spatiotemporally decoupled reconstruction strategy is pioneered to engineer a dual&#8208;metal&#8208;node MOF ([Fe3O(hbdc)3][Ni2(trz)3]) catalyst (hbdc: 2&#8208;hydroxyterephthalic acid, trz: 1,2,4&#8208;triazole), in which orbitally coupled pore&#8208;microenvironments drive time&#8208;phased kinetic reconstruction of the spatially separated Fe/Ni metal nodes, creating a foundational platform to lay bare the mechanisms governing the reconstruction processes and the cross&#8208;scale kinetic. Furthermore, a multimodal operando diagnostic platform is developed that integrates in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ Raman spectroscopy, and real&#8208;time reaction kinetics tracing, to decipher the MOF atomic&#8208;to&#8208;mesoscale reconstruction kinetics from the Fe&#8208;centered active phase to the NiFe&#8208;centered more active phase. Crucially, the purpose&#8208;partitioned pore architecture synergizes the interplay between the Fe&#9472;Ni nodes, while the self&#8208;adaptive defects, bond relaxation, and structural regeneration collectively modulate the kinetic behavior, leading to the pronounced OER activity enhancement. This work establishes a structural dynamics tracking methodology that can integrate multi&#8208;scale characterization techniques and provide deep insights into the reconstruction mechanisms, thus filling the critical gap in understanding structure&#8208;activity relationships under operando conditions.

         <title>Defect Engineering in &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se Heterostructures for High&#8208;Resolution Phototransistor Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;engineered heterojunction &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se with atomically sharp interfaces is created to suppress interface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation. The visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared transparency and high&#8208;k of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 enable top&#8208;gated phototransistors with a tunable photoresponse, achieving significantly improved optoelectronic performance. Furthermore, a high&#8208;resolution phototransistor array is fabricated via thermal scanning probe lithography and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated.








Abstract
Analogous to the pivotal SiO2/Si junction in modern electronics, the &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se architecture has been demonstrated to enhance the performance of electronic devices. However, its potential to improve the optoelectronic properties of Bi2O2Se, such as responsivity and detectivity, remains unexplored. The photodetection performance of Bi2O2Se is primarily limited by intrinsic selenium vacancies at its surface, which lead to low photocurrent and instability. To address this, a defect&#8208;engineered &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterojunction is constructed with an atomically sharp interface via a developed UV&#8208;assisted oxidation strategy. This heterostructure successfully suppresses surface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation, resulting in substantially enhanced optoelectronic performance. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm a stable type&#8208;II band alignment with interfacial transitions enabling efficient carrier dissociation. The visible&#8208;near&#8208;infrared transparency and high&#8208;k of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 further enable top&#8208;gated phototransistors with dynamically tunable photoresponse, achieving the largely improved metrics of responsivity (1.2 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1), detectivity (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;1013 Jones), and on/off ratio (2.3&#160;&#215; 106). Additionally, by using thermal scanning probe lithography, a high&#8208;resolution (pixel pitch = 6.5 &#181;m) &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se phototransistor array is fabricated and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated. The results establish an effective defect&#8208;engineered strategy with in situ large&#8208;area growth capability of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 and high&#8208;resolution device patterning, making &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se a promising photoresponsive platform for advanced optoelectronic devices.

To address this, a defect-engineered &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se heterojunction is constructed with an atomically sharp interface via a developed UV-assisted oxidation strategy. This heterostructure successfully suppresses surface vacancies while enabling dual functionality&#8212;surface passivation and photoactive charge separation, resulting in substantially enhanced optoelectronic performance. First-principles calculations confirm a stable type-II band alignment with interfacial transitions enabling efficient carrier dissociation. The visible-near-infrared transparency and high-&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; of &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; further enable top-gated phototransistors with dynamically tunable photoresponse, achieving the largely improved metrics of responsivity (1.2 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), detectivity (1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones), and on/off ratio (2.3&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, by using thermal scanning probe lithography, a high-resolution (pixel pitch = 6.5 &#181;m) &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se phototransistor array is fabricated and its imaging capabilities are demonstrated. The results establish an effective defect-engineered strategy with in situ large-area growth capability of &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and high-resolution device patterning, making &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se a promising photoresponsive platform for advanced optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precise Morphology Control via Backbone&#8208;Derived Solid Additive Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells to Achieve 20% Efficiency and Thick&#8208;Film Compatibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A backbone&#8208;derived solid additive molecular design strategy enables precise morphology control, optimizes vertical phase distribution, and extends exciton diffusion length, achieving synergistic enhancement of photovoltaic parameters, high efficiencies of 19.81% (100&#160;nm) and 16.93% (400&#160;nm) in binary device, good thickness tolerance, and scalability across multiple organic solar cell systems (over 20% efficiency achieved in various binary devices).








Abstract
Precise control of active layer morphology is essential for advancing organic solar cells (OSCs) toward practical applications. Here, a generalizable morphology regulation strategy is proposed using a structurally tailored crystallization template derived from the polymer donor backbone. A small molecule, BDD&#8208;C6, is designed by extracting the benzodithiophene (BDD) unit from PM6 and appending an alkylated thiophene terminal. When incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO and PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 binary blends, compatibility studies and cross&#8208;sectional absorption analysis reveal a favorable vertical phase distribution on alcohol&#8208;soluble substrates. Thermodynamic evaluations confirm the good thermal stability and crystallinity of BDD&#8208;C6. Crystallization kinetics and morphological characterizations investigations further show that BDD&#8208;C6 delays film formation and promotes polymer ordering, thus extending exciton diffusion length. As a result, PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based binary device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.81% in thin films and maintains a PCE of 16.93% even at a 400&#160;nm thickness. Moreover, PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;based OSCs present an efficiency of over 20%. Extending this strategy to D18 systems using a DTBT&#8208;C6 small molecule similarly enhances morphology and device performance, realizing a PCE of 20.18% in D18:L8&#8208;BO binary device. This work offers a backbone&#8208;derived crystallization template strategy for the scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency OSCs

&lt;p&gt;Precise control of active layer morphology is essential for advancing organic solar cells (OSCs) toward practical applications. Here, a generalizable morphology regulation strategy is proposed using a structurally tailored crystallization template derived from the polymer donor backbone. A small molecule, BDD-C6, is designed by extracting the benzodithiophene (BDD) unit from PM6 and appending an alkylated thiophene terminal. When incorporated into PM6:L8-BO and PM6:BTP-eC9 binary blends, compatibility studies and cross-sectional absorption analysis reveal a favorable vertical phase distribution on alcohol-soluble substrates. Thermodynamic evaluations confirm the good thermal stability and crystallinity of BDD-C6. Crystallization kinetics and morphological characterizations investigations further show that BDD-C6 delays film formation and promotes polymer ordering, thus extending exciton diffusion length. As a result, PM6:L8-BO-based binary device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.81% in thin films and maintains a PCE of 16.93% even at a 400&#160;nm thickness. Moreover, PM6:BTP-eC9-based OSCs present an efficiency of over 20%. Extending this strategy to D18 systems using a DTBT-C6 small molecule similarly enhances morphology and device performance, realizing a PCE of 20.18% in D18:L8-BO binary device.

High&#8208;Performance Air&#8208;Stable Polymer Monolayer Transistors
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202515591), Mengmeng Li and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a fibrillar polymer monolayer with a self&#8208;confinement effect, where aligned chains parallel the nanofiber axis. Employing a top&#8208;gate CYTOP dielectric, this monolayer transistor achieves high mobility (7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and exceptional stability over 1260 days in air. Furthermore, monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistors is achieved, enabling hybrid complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capability.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the research progress of vacancies in electrocatalysis in recent years. It introduces the detection techniques and synthesis strategies of vacancies, discusses the catalytic functions of vacancies in typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms, elaborates on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between vacancies and catalytic performance, and provides theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering.








Abstract
Driven by the &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; strategic goals, electrocatalytic reactions have increasingly become a research frontier in the fields of energy and materials science due to their crucial role in the conversion of clean energy and environmental governance. Vacancy engineering has great potential in enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. Systematically and deeply revealing the mechanism of vacancies in the electrocatalytic process has important value for achieving precise structural regulation and performance optimization of electrocatalysts. This work systematically reviews the research progress of vacancy modification electrocatalysts in recent years. The detection technology of vacancies is introduced, the synthetic strategies for vacancy construction are summarized, the catalytic functions of vacancies in various typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms are mainly discussed, and the regulatory effect of vacancies on the adsorption behavior of intermediates is analyzed. The structure&#8211;function relationship laws of factors such as vacancy type, concentration, and spatial distribution on catalytic performance are further summarized, providing theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering. Finally, the future development direction of vacancy engineering is prospected, with the expectation of providing a theoretical basis and research ideas for constructing new electrocatalytic materials that are efficient, stable, and applicable on a large scale.

         <title>Floating&#8208;Gate Synaptic Transistors for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively summarizes recent advances in FGSTs design for neuromorphic computing. It highlights innovative floating&#8208;gate structures, diverse material systems, and an advanced tunneling dielectric layer, along with their respective roles in enhancing synaptic performances. Finally, it analyzes critical challenges and discusses future research directions toward highly energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing hardware.








Abstract
By integrating nonvolatile memory and processing, floating&#8208;gate synaptic transistors (FGSTs) have emerged as a pivotal platform for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing, overcoming limitations inherent in conventional Von Neumann architectures. These devices utilize a unique floating&#8208;gate layer to facilitate charge storage and manipulation. This review presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in FGST device design, focusing on innovative floating&#8208;gate structures, diverse floating&#8208;gate material systems, and advanced tunneling dielectric layers. These innovations have significantly enhanced synaptic performance, including near&#8208;linear conductance modulation, ultralow energy consumption, multilevel storage, extended retention times, and robust endurance characteristics. Consequently, FGSTs achieve remarkable pattern&#8208;recognition accuracy and effectively mimic complex biological plasticity rules. Moreover, their integration into neuromorphic sensory systems for vision, audition, touch, and neuronal behavior enables these devices to conduct high&#8208;fidelity real&#8208;time multimodal and reconfigurable processing. Despite these advancements, challenges persist in scaling synaptic energy to femtojoule levels, enhancing the mechanical flexibility of wearable electronics, improving operational stability, and developing large&#8208;scale synaptic devices array. This paper outlines strategic pathways in materials and architecture to steer the development of FGSTs toward highly efficient, brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic hardware.

         <title>Supramolecular Multivalent Synergy Enabling Harsh&#8208;Condition Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs) typically suffer from severe performance deterioration under harsh conditions, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials exhibit remarkable phosphorescence stability even in extreme environments, greatly expanding their potential applications. This review highlights recent progress in HCP materials, encompassing design strategies, photophysical characteristics, and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, emerging applications of HCP materials in afterglow displays, information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging are discussed.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescence, which arises from the radiative decay of triplet excitons, has garnered significant interest owing to its exceptional photophysical properties and diverse application potential. However, the intrinsically vulnerable triplet excitons are highly susceptible to environmental factors such as heat, oxygen, and solvents, which significantly compromise the operational stability and durability of organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs). The triplet excitons undergo rapid deactivation via thermal dissipation, oxygen&#8208;mediated energy transfer, and solvent&#8208;induced collapse of rigid microenvironments, leading to severe phosphorescence quenching. Supramolecular multivalent synergy offers an effective strategy for stabilizing triplet excitons, thereby extending beyond ambient stability to sustained phosphorescence under harsh conditions, resulting in robust organic harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials. This review provides a timely and systematic introduction to recent advances in HCP materials, including design and construction strategies, unique optoelectronic properties, underlying stabilization mechanisms, and promising applications. In addition, the summary section highlights pivotal challenges and emerging perspectives within this field to suggest feasible pathways for future research endeavors. This review not only establishes design principles for HCP materials by decoding supramolecular multivalent synergy in triplet exciton stabilization but also paves new avenues toward practical applications.

In contrast, harsh-condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials exhibit remarkable phosphorescence stability even in extreme environments, greatly expanding their potential applications. This review highlights recent progress in HCP materials, encompassing design strategies, photophysical characteristics, and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, emerging applications of HCP materials in afterglow displays, information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic phosphorescence, which arises from the radiative decay of triplet excitons, has garnered significant interest owing to its exceptional photophysical properties and diverse application potential. However, the intrinsically vulnerable triplet excitons are highly susceptible to environmental factors such as heat, oxygen, and solvents, which significantly compromise the operational stability and durability of organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs). The triplet excitons undergo rapid deactivation via thermal dissipation, oxygen-mediated energy transfer, and solvent-induced collapse of rigid microenvironments, leading to severe phosphorescence quenching. Supramolecular multivalent synergy offers an effective strategy for stabilizing triplet excitons, thereby extending beyond ambient stability to sustained phosphorescence under harsh conditions, resulting in robust organic harsh-condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials. This review provides a timely and systematic introduction to recent advances in HCP materials, including design and construction strategies, unique optoelectronic properties, underlying stabilization mechanisms, and promising applications. In addition, the summary section highlights pivotal challenges and emerging perspectives within this field to suggest feasible pathways for future research endeavors. This review not only establishes design principles for HCP materials by decoding supramolecular multivalent synergy in triplet exciton stabilization but also paves new avenues toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Porous Materials for Maritime Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon capture from emission sources, such as marine vessels, has attracted significant attention over the years. To achieve this goal, sorbents such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous polymer networks (PPNs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and their post&#8208;synthetic modifications are currently being explored. This is because of their pore tunability, high selectivity, high surface area and porosity, and fast kinetics.








Abstract
The capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) has drawn significant attention due to the devastation arising from the effects of global warming. This comes from the increasing demand for the transportation of various commodities to meet the needs of the growing population of the world. Onboard capture of CO2 in ships has attracted much attention but suffers due to the high cost of implementation and technical setbacks. This report outlines the challenges of the current CCS technology implemented in maritime operations and evaluates porous materials (MOFs, PPNs, COFs) as a novel material class for the next generation of onboard CO2 capture. Engineering challenges are discussed that can create better synergies of integration in this space, and specific advanced porous materials are suggested that show great promise. If this technology can be implemented onboard vessels, it will greatly help the maritime industry adhere to internationally mandated emission regulations.

         <title>Skin&#8208;to&#8208;Muscle Deep Tissue Stimulation System for Muscle Atrophy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The body&#8208;coupled on&#8208;target stimulation (BOOST) system and active releasing muscle stimulation (ARMS) hydrogel for skin&#8208;to&#8208;muscle deep&#8208;tissue penetration of ionic drug molecule and electrical stimulation (ES) is proposed. The &#8220;BOOSTing ARMS&#8221; system enables simultaneous ES and dexamethasone delivery, effectively restoring muscle cells damaged by oxidative stress, offering a non&#8208;invasive approach for treating muscle atrophy.








Abstract
With the rapidly growing global aging population, muscle atrophy affects &#8776;40% of older individuals, leading to severe impairments in daily activities. However, its treatment remains challenging due to adverse effects associated with drug accumulation, the difficulty of delivering drugs specifically to deep muscle tissues, and the inherent limitations of current therapeutic devices that rely on wired connections or battery&#8208;dependent external power systems. In this study, a body&#8208;coupled on&#8208;target stimulation (BOOST) system is introduced in combination with an active releasing muscle stimulation (ARMS) hydrogel, which possesses anti&#8208;drying properties and enables electroactive drug release. The BOOST system enables battery&#8208;free, wirelessly delivered electrostimulation and simultaneous drug delivery from the skin to deep muscle layers by leveraging charge accumulation in tissue capacitance. This in&#8208;body field amplification generates a muscle&#8208;targeted electric field that enables deep&#8208;tissue drug penetration. In addition, when combined with the electro&#8208;responsive ARMS hydrogel containing electrically bound dexamethasone phosphate (Dex) molecules, the BOOST system exhibits synergistic performance, achieving targeted internal electrostimulation and efficient Dex penetration into deep muscle tissue for effective transdermal&#8208;to&#8208;muscle delivery. The simultaneous application of ES and Dex effectively restores muscle cells severely damaged by oxidative stress, mimicking the pathological conditions of muscle atrophy.

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Controlled Planar Guided Crystallization of Low&#8208;Loss Phase Change Materials for Programmable Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of spatially&#8208;controlled planar guided crystallization is a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low&#8208;loss Sb2S3 phase&#8208;change material (PCM), leveraging the directional crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM&#8208;based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non&#8208;volatile optical phase&#8208;shifter and a programmable metasurface with reconfigurable bound state in the continuum.








Abstract
Photonic integrated devices are progressively evolving beyond passive components into fully programmable systems, notably driven by the progress in chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable nanophotonics. However, the stochastic nature of their crystal grain formation results in strong spatial and temporal crystalline inhomogeneities. Here, the concept of spatially&#8208;controlled planar guided crystallization is proposed, a novel method for programming the growth of optically homogeneous low&#8208;loss Sb2S3 PCM, leveraging the seeded directional and progressive crystallization within confined channels. This guided crystallization method is experimentally shown to circumvent the current limitations of conventional PCM&#8208;based nanophotonic devices, including a multilevel non&#8208;volatile optical phase&#8208;shifter exploiting a silicon nitride&#8208;based Mach&#8211;Zehnder interferometer, and a programmable metasurface with spectrally reconfigurable bound state in the continuum. Precisely controlling the growth of PCMs to ensure optically uniform crystalline properties across devices is the cornerstone for the industrial development of non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable photonic integrated&#160;circuits.

         <title>Radiation Effects in Electret Organic Thin&#8208;Film Transistors Due to High Flux and High Dose X&#8208;Ray Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electret&#8208;style organic thin&#8208;film transistors are evaluated for synchrotron X&#8208;ray dosimetry at ultra&#8208;high dose rates, showing promising performance and agreement with standard detectors. XPS and NEXAFS reveal radiation&#8208;induced oxidation and Fermi level shifts in pentacene and polystyrene, correlating with reduced charge carrier mobility and providing insight into radiation degradation mechanisms in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic electronic devices offer lightweight, flexible, and low&#8208;cost alternatives to conventional semiconductor technologies, with growing interest in dosimetry applications. An organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) with a polymer electret is presented for high dose&#8208;rate synchrotron dosimetry. The OTFT operates in accumulated&#8208;dose and real&#8208;time readout modes and demonstrates excellent linearity with various beam filtrations. Device response increases with decreasing energy, and simulations reveal gold contacts as the primary source of energy dependence. Depth dose measurements show good agreement with a commercial detector, validating dosimetric performance. Minimal changes in mobility are observed at clinically relevant doses, but mobility degradation becomes apparent after high accumulated doses, indicating radiation damage in active materials. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and near&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) techniques are employed to analyze pristine and irradiated active material films separately and in a combined stack. XPS reveals oxidation in pentacene and a Fermi level shift in polystyrene in irradiated films, both of which likely cause the mobility reduction observed in OTFTs. Valence band and NEXAFS spectra show no evidence of new states in the bandgap. These findings demonstrate the potential of OTFTs as dosimeters for high dose&#8208;rates and clarify how radiation alters the molecular structure and electronic behavior of the device.

         <title>Thiocarboxylate&#8208;Mediated Defect Suppression and I2 Scavenging: Achieving 22.16% Efficient and Stable CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (AP) is introduced as interfacial modifier to chelate undercoordinated Pb2+ for mitigating lead leakage, and bond with I&#8722; for suppressing iodide vacancy formation in CsPbI3. Crucially, AP's redox&#8208;active nature scavenges existing I2 and inhibits its generation. Consequently, AP&#8208;modified CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells achieve an efficiency of 22.16%, retaining 97% efficiency after 1000 h illumination.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) offer enhanced thermal stability compared to hybrid counterparts but suffer from interfacial defects, iodide vacancy&#8208;mediated recombination, detrimental I2 formation, and lead leakage, limiting performance and stability. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (AP) as a multifunctional interfacial modifier. AP features thiocarboxylate groups that strongly chelate undercoordinated Pb2+, passivating defects and mitigating lead leakage, while its nitrogen&#8208;containing moieties form hydrogen bonds with I&#8722;, suppressing iodide vacancy formation. Crucially, AP's redox&#8208;active nature chemically scavenges existing I2 and inhibits its generation under thermal and ambient stress. These synergistic interactions promote improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, optimized interfacial energy level alignment, and enhanced charge extraction dynamics. Consequently, AP&#8208;modified CsPbI3 PSCs achieve significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency of 22.16% and open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.29 V. Furthermore, the devices exhibit exceptional operational stability, retaining 97% initial efficiency after 1000 h continuous illumination under maximum power point tracking. This work demonstrates AP as a highly effective interfacial regulator and presents new insights into multifunctional molecular engineering for stable and high&#8208;efficiency all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.

         <title>Modulating Salt Dissociation and Solvent Immobilization Through Dipole Interactions in Polymer Electrolytes for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;functional cationic COF&#8208;LiTFSI filler is incorporated into PVHF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes, where strong dipole interactions enhance lithium salt dissociation and immobilize residual solvents, thereby facilitating Li&#8314; transport and stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) show great potential for application in solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, their poor ion transport capabilities and uncontrolled electrode/electrolyte interfacial reactions induced by residual solvents limit their overall electrochemical performance. To address these challenges, a LiTFSI&#8208;replaced dual&#8208;functional cationic covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;is strategically designed, denoted COF&#8208;LiTFSI, as organic fillers into poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) to regulate Li+ transport and electrode/electrolyte interface stability. The introduction of dipole interactions between cationic moieties embedded in the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework and Li salt significantly enhances dissociation, thereby improving Li&#8314; transport and lowering the activation energy (Ea), while the strong dipole interaction between residual N&#8208;methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and the COF&#8208;LiTFSI framework immobilizes the NMP molecule, markedly enhancing the electrochemical stability of the PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE with a Li metal anode. Consequently, the optimized PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieves a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 0.63 mS cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the Li/Li, Li/LFP (LiFePO4), and Li/NCM811(LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) cells equipped with PVHF&#8208;COF&#8208;CPE achieve remarkably stable cycling. This work presents a novel strategy to regulate ion transport and interface stability in VDF&#8208;based SPEs by leveraging dipole interactions, enabling high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.

         <title>Tailored Xenogeneic&#8208;Free Polymer Surface Promotes Dynamic Migration of Intestinal Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a PoLymer&#8208;coated Ultra&#8208;stable Surface (PLUS), a nitrogen plasma&#8208;treated poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate), as a stable xenogeneic&#8208;free platform for intestinal stem cell culture. PLUS enhances cell attachment, supports actin&#8208;driven migration, and retains functionality after 3 years of storage. Promoting cytoskeletal reorganization, it enables dynamic migration and wound closure, offering a scalable solution for regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Regenerative therapy employing intestinal stem cells (ISCs) holds promise for epithelial restoration. However, it requires scalable and robust, but fully defined culture platforms free of xenogeneic components. Most existing systems, however, typically rely on Matrigel, which complicates clinical translation and limits understanding of stem cell&#8208;material interactions. Here, a poly(ethyleneglycoldimethacrylate) (pEGDMA)&#8208;based synthetic culture surface is exposed to N2 plasma treatment for tailored modulation of surface properties. This modification enhances surface wettability and introduces N&#8208;containing functional groups, resulting in a PoLymer&#8208;coated Ultra&#8208;stable Surface (PLUS) that improves ISC attachment under xenogeneic&#8208;free culture conditions. Remarkably, PLUS maintains its ISC&#8208;supportive function even after 3 years of ambient storage. Gene expression and proteomic analyses reveal upregulation of factors involved in actin dynamics and cytoskeletal reorganization. Consistently, colonies on PLUS exhibit a broader migratory range, with a 1.8&#8208;fold increase in migration speed compared to pristine pEGDMA. Small&#8208;molecule perturbation assays confirm the involvement of cytoskeletal remodelling by mediating ISC&#8208;substrate interaction. Furthermore, PLUS supports dynamic, actin&#8208;dependent migration, enabling up to 46.7% wound closure within 144&#160;h. These findings demonstrate that PLUS engages cytoskeletal machinery as a central mediator of ISC&#8208;substrate interaction, in part by promoting actin&#8208;dependent cytoskeletal reorganization, positioning it as a scalable, translational platform for ISC&#8208;based regenerative medicine.

         <title>3D Bioprinted Human Synovium&#8208;Cartilage Models Mimic Rheumatoid Arthritis Microenvironment and Recapitulate In Vivo Therapeutic Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents human in vitro rheumatoid arthritis models using chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogels with fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes, pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, and protective barrier macrophages, closely recapitulating key rheumatoid arthritis pathological features. This model is validated by anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, and its transcriptomic and proteomic profiles are aligned with in vivo pathology, offering reliable platforms for preclinical drug screening.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models play crucial roles in therapeutic discovery and fundamental research. However, current models have limited success at accurately simulating in vivo microenvironment and lacking intricate cellular cross&#8208;talk. Here, this work presents a human in vitro RA model that faithfully captures functional and compositional properties of cartilage and synovial lining in vivo, established with chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted bi&#8208;layered Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogel incorporating fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes (FLS) and proinflammatory macrophages in the top layer and protective barrier macrophages in the bottom layer. This synovium&#8208;cartilage system recapitulates key inflammatory processes akin to RA, including enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and degradative enzymes, as well as reactive oxygen species generation, invasion of FLS into cartilage, phenotypic alterations of macrophages and the depletion of cartilaginous extracellular matrix components. The established model enables effective screening of anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, which is validated by leveraging celecoxib and tofacitinib. Furthermore, the transcriptomic and proteomic landscape of this model demonstrates accuracy in replicating in vivo pathological conditions. Notably, this in vitro model reflects the response of the disease to the drug compared to the rat model of RA. Overall, this study provides reliable in vitro human synovium&#8208;cartilage models for screening preclinical drugs in RA therapeutics.

         <title>Vertical Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Arrays for Page&#8208;Wise Parallel Logic and Arithmetic Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a page&#8208;wise logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory architecture realized in a 3D vertical resistvie random&#8208;access memory array of self&#8208;rectifying memristors. By introducing intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;page logic primitives, the system enables Boolean and arithmetic operations to be executed directly within the memory. A memristive arithmetic logic unit is experimentally demonstrated, including a compact 2&#8208;bit full&#8208;adder, validating high reproducibility and reduced spatiotemporal cost. These results establish a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient pathway toward in&#8208;memory computing with vertical memristive arrays.








Abstract
Logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory (LIM) architectures are explored to address the data transfer bottleneck of conventional von Neumann architectures by integrating computation directly within memory arrays. Among various candidates, memristor&#8208;based LIM systems have gained significant attention due to their non&#8208;volatile switching behavior and compatibility with dense integration. In this work, a page&#8208;wise LIM architecture is implemented using a 3D vertical resistive random&#8208;access memory array composed of self&#8208;rectifying Pt&#8211;Ta2O5&#8211;Al:HfO2&#8211;TiN memristors. Two logic primitives&#8212;1&#160;M and 2&#160;M logic&#8212;are employed to perform intra&#8208;page and inter&#8208;page operations, respectively, enabling core Boolean functions to be executed entirely within the array through resistive state transitions. Based on these logic operations, a memristive arithmetic logic unit (mALU) is designed to perform essential arithmetic functions, including addition, subtraction, increment, and decrement. Owing to the vertical structure of vertical resistive random&#8208;access memory, a 2&#8208;bit full adder is implemented with a footprint of only three cells and completed in 12 steps. The proposed intra&#8208;and inter&#8208;page operations, along with complete mALU functionality, are experimentally demonstrated with high reproducibility. Combined with significantly reduced spatiotemporal cost, these results highlight the promise of this architecture for scalable and energy&#8208;efficient in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Sustainable Recovery of Critical Minerals from Li&#8208;Ion Battery Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid microwave plasma pretreatment transforms mixed battery black mass, enabling complete recovery of critical minerals in mild solvents at room temperature. Plasma&#8208;induced lattice disruption in cathode materials enhances solubility, unlocking a fast, energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable battery recycling. The process simultaneously regenerates anodic graphite.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) recycling plays a vital role in the circular economy by supporting a reliable and sustained supply of critical minerals. Commercial black mass, comprising cathode active materials and anodic graphite from spent LIBs, typically requires multiple energy&#8208;intensive steps for the recovery and regeneration of its critical minerals. Here, we report that a single&#8208;step microwave&#8208;induced plasma pre&#8208;treatment can lead to 85% selective Li recovery in water and &#8776;95% recovery of all transition metals in 1 M citric acid at room temperature. Of the various gas compositions evaluated, H2/N2 demonstrates the highest effectiveness. The synergistic action of H2 plasma, microwave coupling, and localized heating reduces the layered LIB cathode metal oxides to their metallic or lower&#8208;valence oxide forms, thereby enabling their facile extraction in green solvents. The residue consists of anodic graphite, which is regenerated through plasma treatment that reduces defects and decreases the interlayer spacing. The recovered graphite shows excellent efficiency as an LIB anode, surpassing commercial graphite in its activity. While here microwave plasma pretreatment has been explored for LIB recycling, it is a technological innovation that can serve as a versatile pretreatment step for hydrometallurgical extraction of critical minerals.

         <title>A Lean&#8208;Water Hydrogel Electrolyte with Engineered Water&#8208;Lubricated Pathways Constructed by Unique Water&#8208;Inter&#8208;Micelle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte with unique water&#8208;inter&#8208;micelle structure and tailored polymer network is prepared via a novel and facile method. Through the hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic self&#8208;assembly of micelles, the limited water is distributed in the interstices between micelles, forming continuous water pathways for Zn2+ transport. Therefore, lean&#8208;water hydrogel achieves high ionic conductivity of 3.2 mS cm&#8722;1 at only 17.8 wt.% water.








Abstract
Hydrogel polymer electrolytes (HPEs) can mitigate leakage and suppress side reactions than liquid electrolytes in aqueous batteries. Nevertheless, their water content typically exceeds 80%, which perpetuates water&#8208;mediated side reactions. Characterized by a substantial reduction in water content, lean&#8208;water HPEs are designed. However, insufficient water severely impedes Zn2+ transport due to strong polymer&#8208;ion interactions. Herein, a lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte with a unique water&#8208;inter&#8208;micelle structure to overcome this dilemma via engineering water pathways is designed. Minimal water induces zinc dodecylbenzenesulfonate self&#8208;assembly into micelles, confining water within micellar interstices. This structure enables rapid Zn2+ migration along water&#8208;lubricated interstices, achieving 15.3 mS cm&#8722;1 conductivity at a water content of 20.6 wt.%. Subsequently, copolymerization of acrylamide (AM) and 4&#8208;acryloylmorpholine (ACMO) yielded a P(AM&#8208;ACMO) (PAC) lean&#8208;water hydrogel electrolyte. Compared with conventional HPEs, densely packed micelles within PAC create ordered slit channels that establish continuous water pathways using only trace amounts of water. This maximizes water utilization, suppresses side reactions, and endows PAC with high ionic conductivity (3.2 mS cm&#8722;1) and Zn2+ transference number (0.88) at only 17.8 wt.% water content. In addition to high ionic conductivity and the ability to suppress dendrites, PAC also demonstrates exceptional adhesion and dehydration resistance, which contribute to its application in practical scenarios.

         <title>Tuning Transition Dipole Moment Alignment via Bifunctional Ligands in Perovskite Nanocrystal Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional ligand exchange with 1,5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid suppresses surface defects and enhances carrier transport in perovskite quantum dot films. More importantly, it promotes long&#8208;range nanocrystal stacking, increasing the horizontal dipole fraction from 60% to 70%. This orientation control improves light outcoupling efficiency from 16.15% to 20.09%, enabling external quantum efficiencies above 22% with enhanced stability.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeQLEDs) are promising for display and lighting applications. As the internal quantum efficiency of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PeQLEDs approaches unity, enhancing photon extraction becomes critical due to severe optical losses. The orientation of transition dipole moments (TDMs) plays a key role in determining the light outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). Herein, the influence of nanocrystal (NC) shape and stacking behavior on the alignment of TDMs in the emissive layer is investigated. To modulate the TDMs, a facile ligand exchange strategy with bifunctional 1,5&#8208;naphthalenedisulfonic acid (NDSA) is introduced, which suppresses surface defects and improves carrier transport efficiency. More importantly, it enhances long&#8208;range NC stacking and modifies the dielectric environment of the emissive layer (EML), which increases the fraction of in&#8208;plane TDMs from 60% to 70%. This improved orientation is instrumental in &#951;out from 16.15% to 20.09%. As a result, devices with NDSA modified exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.63% at 5127 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and a maximum luminance of 13&#160;950 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, significantly outperforming the pristine device. EQE remains above 20% across 400&#8211;8000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and device lifetime improves by 400% under ambient conditions with encapsulation.

The microporous Ti12 oxocluster&#8208;based MOF MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT exhibits effective charge separation and long&#8208;lived photogenerated electrons persisting for hours, as revealed by spectroscopy. These electrons cause reversible color changes and enable dark H2 evolution and water splitting, demonstrating remarkable electron storage and redox capability, positioning MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT as a promising material for photocatalysis and solar energy storage.








Abstract
The microporous Ti12 oxocluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT exhibits excellent stability and photoactivity, making it highly promising for photocatalysis. Using transient and photoinduced absorption spectroscopies, the behavior of reactive electrons in MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT across femtosecond&#8208;to&#8208;second timescales is investigated. The framework shows efficient charge separation and slow decay kinetics, with photogenerated charges persisting into the microsecond&#8208;second (&#181;s&#8208;s) range and displaying higher yields and slower recombination than benchmark MOFs MIL&#8208;125(Ti)&#8208;NH2 and UiO&#8208;66(Zr)&#8208;NH2. Photogenerated holes oxidize water with an O2 yield of 335&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the presence of electron scavengers. Under continuous irradiation, long&#8208;lived electrons accumulate, further enhanced by a hole scavenger (methanol). Remarkably, these electrons persist over 48&#160;h post&#8208;excitation under argon, accompanied by a reversible white&#8208;to&#8208;black color change. The stored electrons remain redox&#8208;active, efficiently reducing added O2 and methyl viologen. Dark addition of a Pt co&#8208;catalyst to photocharged MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT induces H2 evolution at &#8776;300&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1 (&#8776;58&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1), corresponding to an accumulated electron density of one electron per 12 Ti atoms. These results highlight the photocharging properties of MIP&#8208;177(Ti)&#8208;LT and its potential for sustainable photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Ultrathin Monatomic Antimony Films by Sacrificial Atomic Layer Deposition for Phase Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;step sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) process enables wafer&#8208;scale growth of ultrathin and uniform antimony (Sb) thin films. An ultrathin (&#8776;4 nm) Sb film is uniformly deposited with its characteristic bilayer structure (Sb&#8208;Sb) aligned along the substrate. The excellent surface coverage of the s&#8208;ALD allows facile electrical conduction even in the few&#8208;nanometer thickness range.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb) is an intriguing material for advanced electronics, with thickness&#8208;dependent properties at the nanoscale offering new functionalities. However, conventional methods for depositing Sb thin films cannot produce continuous ultrathin films with conformality in complex nanoscale structures. This study introduces a novel sacrificial atomic layer deposition (s&#8208;ALD) approach that overcomes these limitations by using chemical substitution between the antimony precursor and the pre&#8208;deposited Sb2Te3. The structural similarity between Sb2Te3 and Sb enables local epitaxial growth of a uniform, (00l)&#8208;oriented Sb film with exceptional surface smoothness (root&#8208;mean&#8208;squared roughness &lt;&lt; 1 nm) at a 4&#8208;nm thickness. Highly pure Sb films with excellent wafer&#8208;scale uniformity and conformality are achieved on high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio structures. The mechanism involves substitution reactions driven by the preferential Te&#8208;(CH3)3Si bonding, along with enhanced atomic diffusion through the aligned crystal structure. Phase change memory devices using 5&#8208;nm&#8208;thick s&#8208;ALD Sb films demonstrate ultrafast switching with femtosecond laser pulses (&#8776;220 fs) with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity (coefficient of variation &lt; 5 %) and ultralow drift coefficients (0.0013 for the on state and 0.0073 for the off state). This s&#8208;ALD technique offers a promising pathway for depositing ultrathin, uniform Sb films, enabling full utilization of Sb's unique nanoscale properties.

         <title>Constructing Highly Durable Fuel Cell Catalysts Through Integrating Graphitic Shell&#8208;Protected Composite Carbon Support with Gaseous Co Deposition&#8208;Driven PtCo Intermetallics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy is developed to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co&#8208;driven diffusion into finely dispersed Pt nanoparticles supported on a ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline&#8208;derived core&#8208;shell structured composite carbon support. The corresponding PGM catalysts simultaneously achieved exceptional carbon support and catalyst stabilities owing to highly ordered PtCo intermetallic nanoparticles covered with a thin carbon layer, which are well&#8208;dispersed on the unique composite carbon support.








Abstract
Metal dissolution, nanoparticle agglomeration, and carbon support corrosion cause significant performance degradation of current PtCo catalysts under acidic and oxidative oxygen reduction reaction. Here, an integrated strategy is presented to design high&#8208;performance Pt3Co intermetallic catalysts by regulating gaseous Co deposition&#8208;driven diffusion into Pt nanoparticles supported on a composite carbon. The composite carbon is derived from ZIF&#8208;8/polyaniline, consisting of a high&#8208;surface&#8208;area (HSC) core and a protective graphitic shell (GS), which is employed to design 40&#160;wt.% Pt/HSC@GS catalyst. The corresponding membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) can maintain 1.09 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V (20. 7% loss) after 10&#160;000 cycles (1.0&#8211;1.5&#160;V for carbon stability) and 1.15 A cm&#8722;2 (16.1% loss) after 150&#160;000 cycles (0.60&#8211;0.95&#160;V for catalyst stability). A ordered Pt3Co intermetallic is synthesized via a gaseous Co&#8208;deposition process, which yields a homogeneous Co&#8208;rich layer onto the Pt nanoparticles on the composite support, thereby facilitating Co diffusion into Pt crystal during subsequent ordering annealing to form the ordered intermetallic structure. This gaseous deposition leads to a thin carbon layer on PtCo nanoparticles, inhibiting particle growth during the annealing and mitigating Co dissolution under dynamic electrochemical conditions. The PtCo catalyst achieves impressive MEA performance and long&#8208;term durability (1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at 0.7&#160;V after 120&#160;000 cycles) under heavy&#8208;duty conditions.

         <title>Photochemical Anchoring of Ultrahigh&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in MOFs for Enhanced Oxidase&#8208;Mimicking Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a pyrolysis&#8208;free, low&#8208;temperature photochemical strategy to anchor ultrahigh&#8208;loading single&#8208;atom catalysts in meta&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). Preserving structural integrity and pyridinic N sites, enables unique coordination environments (Pt&#8208;N2Cl2) for exceptional oxidase&#8208;mimicking activity and ultrasensitive biosensing.








Abstract
Achieving high metal loadings in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) remains a major challenge due to the degradation of anchoring sites during high&#8208;temperature synthesis. Here, a low&#8208;temperature photochemical reduction strategy that preserves the structural integrity of MOF and maximizes the density of unsaturated pyridinic nitrogen sites for efficient metal atom anchoring is reported. This pyrolysis&#8208;free approach enables the synthesis of SACs with record&#8208;high metal loadings, up to 20.5 wt.% for Pt, 16.9 wt.% for Ru, 15.4 wt.% for Os, 12.9 wt.% for Fe, and 9.6 wt.% for Cu, surpassing previous MOF&#8208;derived SACs by one order of magnitude. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the unique Pt&#8208;N2Cl2 coordination significantly enhances oxidase&#8208;like activity compared to conventional Pt&#8208;N3 configurations. Furthermore, the high metal loading increases the density of catalytically active sites, thereby improving overall catalytic efficiency. As a proof of concept, a Pt&#8208;SACs@MOF&#8208;based immunosensor achieves ultrasensitive detection of &#945;&#8208;fetoprotein (AFP) with a detection limit as low as 3 fg mL&#8722;1. This work offers a general and scalable strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;density SACs, addressing the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between metal loading and structural stability in MOF&#8208;based catalysts.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the unique Pt-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coordination significantly enhances oxidase-like activity compared to conventional Pt-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; configurations. Furthermore, the high metal loading increases the density of catalytically active sites, thereby improving overall catalytic efficiency. As a proof of concept, a Pt-SACs@MOF-based immunosensor achieves ultrasensitive detection of &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP) with a detection limit as low as 3 fg mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work offers a general and scalable strategy for synthesizing high-density SACs, addressing the long-standing trade-off between metal loading and structural stability in MOF-based catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Family of Ternary Intermetallic Compounds with Dualistic Atomic Ordering &#8211; The ZIP Phases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZIP phases are ternary intermetallic compounds with dualistic atomic ordering, i.e., they exhibit one face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc; space group Fd3&#175;$\bar 3$m) variant and one hexagonal (space group P63/mmc) variant. The ZIP phases in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni system are the Nb3SiNi2 (fcc) and Ni3SiNb2 (hexagonal) ternary IMCs, crystal structure schematics of which are pasted on the yin&#8208;yang Chinese cosmological symbol of duality.








Abstract
A new family of nanostructured ternary intermetallic compounds &#8722; named the ZIP phases &#8722; is introduced in this work. The ZIP phases exhibit dualistic atomic ordering, i.e., they form two structural variants: one with the fcc diamond cubic structure (space group Fd3&#175;$\bar 3$m) and one with the hexagonal structure (space group P63/mmc). They are also characterized by metallic behavior, ionic bonding, and atomic zigzagging. Powder metallurgical routes involving pressure&#8208;assisted densification are adopted to demonstrate ZIP phase synthesis in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Co, Ta&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, V&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni, and Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Fe ternary systems. Crucially, reactive hot pressing is capable of producing high&#8208;purity ZIP phase materials after the judicious, elemental system&#8208;specific optimization of the processing route. Synthesis of phase&#8208;pure materials &#8211; demonstrated in the Nb&#8208;Si&#8208;Ni ternary system by the synthesis of quasi phase&#8208;pure Nb3SiNi2 and Ni3SiNb2 ZIP phase&#8208;based materials &#8211; is a steppingstone to the prospective exploitation of the ZIP phases. Characterization of Nb3SiNi2 and Ni3SiNb2 involves crystal structure determination, spatially resolved chemical analysis, and determination of select thermal, electrical, magnetic, mechanical, and physical properties. Density functional theory is used to assess the stability of Nb3SiNi2 &amp; Ni3SiNb2 and derivative binary compounds at different temperatures, also exploring the exfoliation of these two ZIP phases along specific surfaces to produce 2D derivatives.

         <title>Vanadium&#8208;Assisted Epitaxy Growth of Wafer&#8208;Scale Bilayer Tungsten Disulfide Ferroelectric Semiconductor Single Crystals with High&#8208;Endurance Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vanadium&#8208;assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two&#8208;inch bilayer 3R&#8208;WS2 single crystals. The introduction of vanadium not only increases interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R&#8208; and 2H&#8208;WS2, but also promotes parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. FeS&#8208;FETs with high&#8208;endurance and a large write/erase ratio are fabricated due to excellent polarization.








Abstract
Bilayer rhombohedral&#8208;stacked (3R) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with switchable polarization expand the ferroelectric scope and provide a promising avenue to construct low&#8208;power and nonvolatile memory devices. However, epitaxy growth of wafer&#8208;scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals is still on the way due to the challenge of phase structure and domain orientation control. Here, a vanadium&#8208;assisted epitaxy strategy is designed to synthesize two&#8208;inch bilayer 3R&#8208;WS2 single crystals on c&#8208;plane sapphire. The introduction of vanadium not only increases the interlayer coupling to break the formation energy degeneracy between 3R&#8208; and hexagonal&#8208;stacked (2H) WS2, but also promotes the parallel steps evolution on sapphire surfaces to induce the unidirectional bilayer domains nucleation. Ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors with high endurance (more than 105 cycles) and a large write/erase ratio (3.0 &#215; 105) are fabricated due to excellent polarization. This work represents a substantial leap in terms of controlling synthesis and memory device construction of wafer&#8208;scale 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystals, which should promote the further design of logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips to overcome von Neumann architecture bottlenecks.

         <title>A Giant Acceptor with a Novel Oxygenated Linker Modulates Molecular Crystallization Kinetics for High&#8208;Efficiency Non&#8208;Halogenated&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells</title>

A novel oxygenated Linker of giant acceptor modulates molecular&#8208;crystallization kinetics for high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;halogenated&#8208;processed organic solar cells and modules.








Abstract
The use of low&#8208;boiling&#8208;point halogenated solvents is common in lab&#8208;scale organic solar cell (OSC) fabrication to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), but their high volatility hinders large&#8208;scale fabrication. High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are adopted as alternatives, but they often result in significant efficiency losses due to inferior morphology. In this work, toluene is adopted, enabling scalable production without any post&#8208;treatment. Two giant guest acceptors, featuring distinct oxygenated side chains, are introduced to modulate pre&#8208;aggregation in solution and crystallization kinetics within the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. The incorporation of giant acceptors effectively inhibits rapid acceptor aggregation and promotes smaller phase separation. Moreover, G&#8208;1O with a shorter oxygenated side chain yields more homogeneous phase separation, whereas G&#8208;3O with a longer side chain leads to uneven separation. Therefore, the G&#8208;1O&#8208;based ternary device achieves an outstanding PCE of 20.02%. Notably, a high PCE of 16.97% is also obtained in a large&#8208;area module (15.6 cm2, without dead zone). These findings highlight the critical role of oxygenated side&#8208;chain engineering in guest molecules for tuning crystallization kinetics under toluene processing.

         <title>Unfolding and Degradation of Micellar Immunodrug Carriers Derived From End Group Modified Aliphatic Poly(Carbonate)s with Acid&#8208;Responsive Ketal Side Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;responsive polymeric micelle system based of aliphatic poly(carbonate)s with benzyl ketal side chains is designed for targeted immunodrug delivery. It can disassemble in endosomal environments, enabling site&#8208;specific immunoactivation and enhanced biodegradability. Covalent end group conjugation of a TLR7/8 agonist regulates immune cell activation and cytokine regulation, offering a promising platform for safer, more effective immunotherapeutics.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule immunodrugs hold significant promise for immunotherapeutic applications including vaccination and cancer therapy. However, their clinical use is limited by severe side effects resulting from systemic distribution. To address this challenge, a biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive nanocarrier system designed for controlled immunodrug delivery in vivo is presented. It is based on polymeric micelles that disassemble in response to acidic environments, enabling site&#8208;specific particle unfolding following endocytosis by antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Its core structure features a hydrolysable aliphatic poly(carbonate) backbone, promoting both biocompatibility and biodegradability. The high precision of the applied ring&#8208;opening polymerization allows for polymer end group functionalization, including the integration of fluorophores for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based monitoring of particle integrity and unfolding. The observations reveal a pH&#8208;dependent disassembly profile both in vitro and in vivo. Comparative studies with non&#8208;responsive poly(carbonate)s demonstrate the superior performance of the acid&#8208;responsive design in selectively disassembling under acidic conditions and enhancing polymer backbone degradation. Furthermore, covalent conjugation of a small molecule Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist promotes its controlled delivery in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved immune cell uptake and regulated cytokine production.

&lt;p&gt;An acid-responsive polymeric micelle system based of aliphatic poly(carbonate)s with benzyl ketal side chains is designed for targeted immunodrug delivery. It can disassemble in endosomal environments, enabling site-specific immunoactivation and enhanced biodegradability. Covalent end group conjugation of a TLR7/8 agonist regulates immune cell activation and cytokine regulation, offering a promising platform for safer, more effective immunotherapeutics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small-molecule immunodrugs hold significant promise for immunotherapeutic applications including vaccination and cancer therapy. However, their clinical use is limited by severe side effects resulting from systemic distribution. To address this challenge, a biodegradable, acid-responsive nanocarrier system designed for controlled immunodrug delivery in vivo is presented. It is based on polymeric micelles that disassemble in response to acidic environments, enabling site-specific particle unfolding following endocytosis by antigen-presenting cells. Its core structure features a hydrolysable aliphatic poly(carbonate) backbone, promoting both biocompatibility and biodegradability. The high precision of the applied ring-opening polymerization allows for polymer end group functionalization, including the integration of fluorophores for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based monitoring of particle integrity and unfolding. The observations reveal a pH-dependent disassembly profile both in vitro and in vivo. Comparative studies with non-responsive poly(carbonate)s demonstrate the superior performance of the acid-responsive design in selectively disassembling under acidic conditions and enhancing polymer backbone degradation. Furthermore, covalent conjugation of a small molecule Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist promotes its controlled delivery in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved immune cell uptake and regulated cytokine production. The findings underscore the potential of this biodegradable, acid-responsive micellar nanocarrier system as precision delivery platform for safer and effective immunotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Terahertz Field Control of the Emergent Magnetic and Electronic Interactions at Oxide Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intense single&#8208;cycle THz electric&#8208;field pulses enable ultrafast control of emergent electronic and magnetic states at LaNiO3/CaMnO3 interfaces. Combined X&#8208;ray and optical probes reveal sub&#8208;picosecond demagnetization driven by spin&#8208;polarized currents and slower magnetoelastic dynamics linked to spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These intertwined processes uncover a pathway to manipulate interfacial ferromagnetism in correlated oxides using ultrafast THz&#8208;field control.








Abstract
Ultrafast electric&#8208;field control of emergent electronic and magnetic states at oxide interfaces offers exciting prospects for the development of the next generation of energy&#8208;efficient devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the electronic structure and emergent ferromagnetic interfacial state in epitaxial LaNiO3/CaMnO3 superlattices can be effectively controlled using intense, single&#8208;cycle THz electric&#8208;field pulses. A suite of advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopic techniques is employed to measure a detailed magneto&#8208;optical profile and the thickness of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer. Then, a combination of time&#8208;resolved and temperature&#8208;dependent optical measurements is used to disentangle several correlated electronic and magnetic processes driven by ultrafast, high&#8208;field THz pulses. Sub&#8208;picosecond non&#8208;equilibrium Joule heating of the electronic system is observed, ultrafast demagnetization of the ferromagnetic interfacial layer, and slower dynamics indicative of a change in the magnetic state of the superlattice due to the transfer of spin&#8208;angular momentum to the lattice. These findings suggest a promising avenue for the efficient control of 2D ferromagnetic states at oxide interfaces using ultrafast electric&#8208;field pulses.

         <title>A Biomimetic MOF&#8208;Based &#8220;Dual&#8208;Stage Cumulative Activation&#8221; Autophagic Degradation System to Counter Tumor Recurrence Following Incomplete Radiofrequency Ablation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gallium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based dual&#8208;stage autophagic degradation system cloaked with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell membranes delivers YTHDF1 binder Y040 and Beclin&#8208;1 to degrade YTHDF1, suppress m6A&#8211;EGFR signaling, induce immunogenic cell death, and prevent incomplete RFA (iRFA)&#8208;induced HCC recurrence while synergizing with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 therapy.








Abstract
Incomplete RFA (iRFA) often leads to local tumor recurrence and metastasis in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The m6A reader protein YTHDF1 plays an important role in this process. However, there are currently no effective YTHDF1&#8208;specific inhibitors capable of overcoming tumor relapse following iRFA. This study successfully develops a &#8220;dual&#8208;stage cumulative activation&#8221; autophagic degradation system based on a gallium MOF scaffold. The MOF are cloaked with HCC&#8208;derived membranes, and a YTHDF1&#8208;specific small molecule binder Y040 and the autophagy&#8208;activating peptide Beclin&#8208;1 are assembled through metabolic glycan engineering combined with click chemistry. GaMOF@M&#8208;Beclin&#8208;Y040 increases autophagic flux in the HCC cells by 7.1&#8208;fold, and selectively degrades YTHDF1 with an efficiency of up to 92%. This in turn reduces m6A&#8208;mediated transcript stability of EGFR and protein translation. Moreover, GaMOF@M&#8208;Beclin&#8208;Y040 could trigger immunogenic cell death of HCC cells. Across three distinct HCC tumor models, GaMOF@M&#8208;Beclin&#8208;Y040 effectively prevent local tumor recurrence post&#8208;iRFA with an inhibition rate of 93.4%, synergized with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody to suppress metastatic tumor growth by 96.6% after iRFA relapse, and induced durable immune memory that reduced the recurrence rate to 7.5%. This novel protein degradation platform can address tumor recurrence after iRFA, and potentially be applied to other oncogenic targets. Furthermore, it offers a conceptual framework for treating tumors harboring traditionally &#8220;undruggable&#8221; targets.

         <title>Polarimetric Photodetector with Ultrahigh&#8208;Sensitivity and Polarity Reverse Based on Quasi&#8208;1D Semimetal (TaSe4)2I/2D MoTe2 Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel (TaSe4)2I/MoTe2 heterojunction architecture achieves four&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude dark current suppression via interfacial band engineering, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband detection with high sensitivity. Furthermore, its unique polarization&#8208;state reversal permits filter&#8208;free dual&#8208;band polarimetric imaging, showcasing significant potential for advanced on&#8208;chip photonic systems.








Abstract
Polarimetric photodetectors, capable of resolving both intensity and polarization states of light, are pivotal for advanced multispectral imaging and target recognition. Examples have been demonstrated for applications such as autonomous vehicle lidar systems and polarization&#8208;based biomedical imaging, where accurate polarization information improves target detection and contrast. However, conventional polarimetric detectors are constrained by complicated optical components and single&#8208;band polarization resolution. Here, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction strategy is proposed that synergizes the unique optoelectronic properties and giant anisotropy of quasi&#8208;1D Weyl semimetal with 2D semiconductor 2H&#8208;MoTe2, achieving great dark current suppression and dual&#8208;band polarization&#8208;spectrum detection through interfacial band engineering. The (TaSe4)2I/2H&#8208;MoTe2 photodetectors demonstrate high&#8208;performance broadband operation (395&#8211;2200&#160;nm) with a detectivity of 2.1&#215;1012 Jones, responsivity of 40&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and quantum efficiency exceeding 11400%, setting a new benchmark for comprehensive performance in phototransistors. Notably, the intrinsic wavelength&#8208;dependent dichroic inversion of (TaSe4)2I enables the orthogonal polarization response polarity reversal between the visible (532&#160;nm) and infrared (1550&#160;nm) bands. Note that dual&#8208;band polarization imaging is successfully achieved, which can be used for multispectral interference identification. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy by constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional semimetal/semiconductor heterojunctions toward future ultrahigh&#8208;sensitivity and broadband polarimetric detectors.

         <title>Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Nanomotor: H2S&#8208;Driven Cascade Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>

A mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanomotor integrates photodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy, and enzyme dynamic therapy into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade through H2S&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming.








Abstract
Despite advances in combination therapies for cancer treatment, most strategies rely on modular&#8208;additive designs that lack dynamic molecular cues to achieve intrinsic synergy. Herein, a mitochondrial&#8208;targeted nanoplatform is introduced that orchestrates photodynamic therapy (PDT), mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) into a self&#8208;amplifying cascade network through gasotransmitter (H2S)&#8208;driven metabolic reprogramming.

Upon GSH exposure, nanomotors produce H2S to boost diffusive motion, while TPP targeting directs this motility toward mitochondria, enabling efficient mitochondrial accumulation (internalization of &gt;100&#160;nm nanoparticles).

&lt;p&gt;A mitochondrial-targeted nanomotor integrates photodynamic therapy, mild photothermal therapy, and enzyme dynamic therapy into a self-amplifying cascade through H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-driven metabolic reprogramming.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite advances in combination therapies for cancer treatment, most strategies rely on modular-additive designs that lack dynamic molecular cues to achieve intrinsic synergy. Herein, a mitochondrial-targeted nanoplatform is introduced that orchestrates photodynamic therapy (PDT), mild photothermal therapy (mPTT), and enzyme dynamic therapy (EDT) into a self-amplifying cascade network through gasotransmitter (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S)-driven metabolic reprogramming. It is constructed from an Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt core with a surface functionalized mesoporous silica shell loaded with photosensitizers, encapsulated within a tumor cell membrane (Au&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pt@4sMSN/PS-TPP@CM). Upon GSH exposure, nanomotors produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S to boost diffusive motion, while TPP targeting directs this motility toward mitochondria, enabling efficient mitochondrial accumulation (internalization of &amp;gt;100&#160;nm nanoparticles). Subsequently, mitochondrial targeted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S releasing-mediated suppression of oxidative phosphorylation amplifies PDT efficacy; HSP70 downregulation enables mPTT; and hyperactive glycolytic metabolism fuels EDT. Furthermore, these enhanced modalities also interconnect in a positive feedback loop: mPTT-derived hyperthermia accelerates EDT-catalyzed oxygen generation for PDT, while mitochondria-localized PDT further inhibits HSP70 to boost mPTT.

         <title>Suppressing Reverse Intersystem Crossing by Confining Organic Molecules within LDH Interlayers for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly active photosensitizer prepared by intercalating I&#8208;IPA into ZnAl&#8208;LDH interlayers via a co&#8208;precipitation strategy is designed for NIR&#8208;II photodynamic immunotherapy, which possesses the highest relative 1O2 quantum yield among all the reported PSs due to the I&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect and LDH&#8208;mediated confinement effect, resulting in excellent performance in cell apoptosis and tumor ablation.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) leveraging near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) light holds promise for deep&#8208;tissue cancer treatment, yet conventional photosensitizers (PSs) suffer from low singlet oxygen (1O2) quantum yields due to inefficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and short&#8208;lived triplet states, hindering PDT effectiveness and subsequent immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction. Herein, a dual&#8208;optimized PS is reported by intercalating I&#8208;functionalized isophthalic acid (I&#8208;IPA) into ZnAl&#8208;LDH interlayers (LDH@I&#8208;IPA) for NIR&#8208;II PDT/immunotherapy. LDH&#8208;mediated confinement effect not only narrows the bandgap for effective NIR&#8208;II excitation, but also prolongs its triplet lifetime by 3 orders of magnitude through suppressing reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). Combined with I&#8208;induced heavy&#8208;atom effect promoting ISC, LDH@I&#8208;IPA achieves a record&#8208;high relative 1O2 quantum yield of 1.89. After polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification, LDH@I&#8208;IPA&#8208;PEG demonstrates potent tumor apoptosis and ICD, suppressing primary/metastatic tumors by 99.5%/52.2% through dendritic cell maturation, macrophage polarization, and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell activation. Theoretical calculations and transcriptomic analysis confirm bandgap engineering, RISC inhibition, and immune pathway regulation.

         <title>Largely Enhanced Photocatalysis Process by Contact&#8208;Electro&#8208;Catalysis for Efficient and Eco&#8208;Friendly Recovery of Gold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an organic&#8208;inorganic composite microsphere catalyst for efficient gold extraction from electronic waste combined contact&#8208;electro&#8208;photocatalysis (CE&#8208;PhC). Fabricated by co&#8208;firing PTFE and TiO2, the catalyst enhances electron transfer and photocatalytic performance under ultrasonic excitation. Comparative tests show nearly an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude improvement in efficiency, offering potential for sustainable precious metal recovery and electronic waste recycling.








Abstract
Precious metal recovery has become increasingly critical due to resource scarcity, while conventional extraction methods often suffer from low efficiency and pollution problem. Here, this work proposes an efficient and environmentally friendly catalytic strategy based on the integration of contact&#8208;electro&#8208;catalysis (CEC) and photocatalysis. The composite microsphere catalyst is fabricated by using low temperature co&#8208;firing TiO2/PTFE particles, which have an average diameter of &#8776;10 &#181;m and expose both TiO2 and PTFE active sites on its surface, enabling dual CEC&#8211;photocatalytic synergy reactions. Compared to pristine TiO2 catalyst with similar weight, this composite microsphere catalyst exhibits a tenfold enhancement in gold extraction efficiency from electronic waste. This high&#8208;performance leaching system operates under mild conditions, alleviating the need for traditional strong oxidants and offering potential for industrial application. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal that charge transfer from H2O to PTFE and subsequently into TiO2, with favorable energy band alignment between PTFE and TiO2 ensuring efficient carrier hopping and enhanced photocatalytic activity. This composite catalytic strategy based on organic&#8211;inorganic microsphere catalysts may be extended to areas like wastewater treatment, organic synthesis, and industrial waste valorization.

         <title>p&#8208;d Orbital Hybridization of S&#8208;Pt&#8208;C Atomic Site Enables Durable Mg&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pd orbital hybridization strategy strengthens metalsupport interactions in single&#8208;metal&#8208;site COFs, stabilizing active sites and steering CO2 conversion pathways. The catalyst enables durable MgCO2 batteries with reduced energy barriers, flower&#8208;like discharge products, and record&#8208;long cycling stability.








Abstract
Single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts integrated within covalent organic framework (COFs) combine maximized atomic utilization with tunable porosity and robust coordination environments, enabling efficient CO2 diffusion, precise active&#8208;site control, and enhanced electron transfer for superior performance in metal&#8208;CO2 batteries. However, their practical application is limited by structural instability owing to the weak coordination effect of metal and &#960; electron under high redox&#8208;active operating condition. Herein, a p&#8208;d orbital hybridization strategy to strengthen metal&#8208;support interaction (MSI) by introducing a sulfur atom with lone&#8208;pair electrons is reported, achieving highly durable Mg&#8208;CO2 and photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The p&#8208;d orbital hybridization strategy effectively lowers the reaction energy barrier and steers the reaction pathway toward the formation of flower&#8208;like discharge products, thereby enhancing both the energy conversion efficiency and reversibility of the battery. The Mg&#8208;CO2 battery with strengthen MSI achieves a high stable operation for over 420&#160;h at an ultralow overpotential of 0.34&#160;V and a high capacity of 50&#160;Ah&#160;g&#8722;1, representing the best&#8208;reported performance among Mg&#8208;CO2 batteries with single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalyst to date. In situ electrochemical spectroscopy and theoretical studies prove that the strong MSI decreases discharge/charge energy barriers and switches the product morphology from dense, compact films to flower&#8208;like morphology.

         <title>Evidence of n&#8208;type Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lack of control in charge carrier type and concentration in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) limits its application as a high thermal conductivity semiconductor. Evidence of n&#8208;type behavior in boron arsenide crystals is shown. They are prepared by an improved growth process, reducing compensating impurities. Defect analysis revealed that silicon&#8208;substituted boron is a potential donor in BAs.








Abstract
Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) is a recently emerging semiconductor that has exceedingly high thermal conductivity. However, the lack of charge carrier concentration control in cubic BAs is a significant hindrance to its application in electronic devices. As&#8208;grown micro crystals of BAs are reported to be unintentionally p&#8208;type. Here, the evidence of inhomogeneous n&#8208;type behavior in BAs crystals grown by an improved growth process reducing the impurities is present. Local n&#8208;type doping is confirmed by four methods: current&#8208;voltage measurement, scanning photocurrent microscopy, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, and Hall effect.

     alt="Evidence of n-type Doping in Cubic Boron Arsenide"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of control in charge carrier type and concentration in cubic boron arsenide (BAs) limits its application as a high thermal conductivity semiconductor. Evidence of n-type behavior in boron arsenide crystals is shown. They are prepared by an improved growth process, reducing compensating impurities. Defect analysis revealed that silicon-substituted boron is a potential donor in BAs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cubic boron arsenide (BAs) is a recently emerging semiconductor that has exceedingly high thermal conductivity. However, the lack of charge carrier concentration control in cubic BAs is a significant hindrance to its application in electronic devices. As-grown micro crystals of BAs are reported to be unintentionally p-type. Here, the evidence of inhomogeneous n-type behavior in BAs crystals grown by an improved growth process reducing the impurities is present. Local n-type doping is confirmed by four methods: current-voltage measurement, scanning photocurrent microscopy, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy, and Hall effect. Their analysis enables the formulation of a model describing BAs band bending on contacts and bias. Analysis of scanning photocurrent microscopy reveals that the diffusion length of minority carriers in BAs is substantial, reaching 33&#160;&#181;m. Defect analysis performed by current transient spectroscopy, photo-induced current transient spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that silicon-substituted boron is a candidate for a donor in BAs. Presented results show the perspective for bipolar control of charge carrier type in BAs and consequently its application in better thermally managed microelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Methylation&#8208;Engineered MR&#8208;TADF Emitters for BT.2020&#8208;Compliant Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with High kRISC and ACQ Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly distorted MR&#8208;TADF emitters are developed by precise methylation of the B/N core, boosting spin&#8211;orbit coupling and suppressing ACQ. The resulting OLEDs exhibit BT.2020&#8208;compliant blue emission, record&#8208;high EQEs (up to 34.8%) with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off, and negligible performance loss up to 10 wt% doping, representing a breakthrough toward practical deep&#8208;blue OLED applications.








Abstract
Achieving deep&#8208;blue emission with high efficiency and color purity remains a major challenge for next&#8208;generation organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly those targeting the BT.2020 color standard. Herein, a methyl substitution&#8208;induced molecular distortion strategy is proposed to construct deep&#8208;blue multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters (BN&#8208;M2 and BN&#8208;M3), that simultaneously enhance spin&#8211;orbit coupling and suppress &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. Strategic methyl substitution induces significant distortion in the B/N core geometry (dihedral angle &gt; 40&#176;), boosting reverse intersystem crossing rates (up to 2.71 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1) and mitigating aggregation&#8208;caused quenching. The optimized emitters achieve narrowband deep&#8208;blue emission (Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage y coordinate, CIEy = 0.045) and near&#8208;ultraviolet emission (CIEy = 0.035), with a full width at half maximum of 22&#8211;24&#160;nm and near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%). Furthermore, OLEDs show record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency with minimal roll&#8208;off: BN&#8208;M3 achieves 34.8% for BT.2020 blue emission, while BN&#8208;M2 reaches 21.4% in the near&#8208;UV spectrum, setting a new benchmark. Notably, the device performance remains stable even at high doping concentrations (up to 15 wt%). This work provides a viable pathway toward realizing BT.2020&#8208;compliant blue OLEDs with both outstanding optoelectronic performance and excellent industrial processability.

         <title>Reprogrammable Dual&#8208;Regulated Pollen Actuators for Geometric Encoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging abundant natural pollen materials, a novel sustainable bilayer actuator demonstrating dual&#8208;layer modulation and complete re&#8208;programmability for controlled complex deformation is presented. The toner pattern defines deformation direction, while the pollen layer adjusts humidity responsiveness via pH. Along with complete reprogramming effectively encodes information through complex geometries as responsive smart devices.








Abstract
Bilayer actuators capable of autonomously responding to complex environmental stimuli have attracted increasing interest for their potential in intelligent and multifunctional systems. Yet, achieving simultaneous programming and reprogramming of shape transformations in both active and passive layers through scalable, sustainable methods remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel bilayer actuator derived from naturally abundant pollen is reported, offering unprecedented dual&#8208;layer re&#8208;programmability. The passive layer, composed of digitally patterned toner, dictates the deformation direction, with the folding angles ranging from 0&#176; to &#8776;152&#176;. Meanwhile, the active pollen layer exhibits tunable humidity responsiveness modulated by pH, controlling actuation curvature ranging from 0.036 to 0.28&#160;cm&#160;cm&#8722;1 and response speed ranging from 1.04 to 0.15&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1. Notably, the entire bilayer system can be fully disassembled via a mild, one&#8208;pot alkaline process, enabling more than 10 cycles of complete reprogramming without structural degradation. This dual&#8208;regulated architecture supports complex 3D geometric transformations and is demonstrated as a carrier of confidential information, encoding data through morphing analogs of encrypted binary code. By integrating programmable mechanics, renewable biomaterials, and energy&#8208;efficient reusability, this work establishes an eco&#8208;friendly and versatile platform for next&#8208;generation responsive materials and encrypted smart devices.

         <title>Suppressing Energetic Disorder of Organic Semiconductors for Semitransparent Photovoltaics and Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy of using phthalate esters as assembly&#8208;inducing agents (AIAs) is introduced to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders. After AIA processing, the light utilization efficiency of semitransparent organic photovoltaics and the mobility of organic field&#8208;effect transistors are improved by 13.7% and 33.3%, respectively.








Abstract
The weak intermolecular interaction and short&#8208;range aggregation endow organic semiconductors with the merits of flexibility, light weight, and solution processibility, while introducing more disorders at the same time. The greater degree of disorders in organic semiconductors, compared to inorganic semiconductors, is one of the major obstacles to their performance; thus, minimizing disorders is a key approach to boost the performance of organic electronics. Here, a strategy of using phthalate esters is introduced as assembly&#8208;inducing agents (AIAs) to improve the packing ordering of organic semiconductors, thereby reducing the energetic disorders and improving the device performance. With dioctyl phthalate AIA, the organic semiconductor PM6 shows a 24% reduction in Urbach energy, 11% narrower absorption full width at half maximum, and suppressed absorption tails in thin film. In organic field&#8208;effect transistors, this strategy offers a lift of hole mobility by 33.3%. In semitransparent organic photovoltaics, this strategy improves the average visible transmittance by 11.2% while maintaining the power conversion efficiency, yielding a high light utilization efficiency of 4.63% in optical structure&#8208;free devices. This work provides a facile and effective approach to suppress the energetic disorder of organic semiconductors and opens up a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Scale Carrier Localization Boosts High&#8208;Temperature Energy Storage and High&#8208;Entropy Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>

Molecular&#8208;scale carrier localization: Carrier regulation via molecular engineering and directional interpenetrating structures, enabling energy storage (high operating condition energy density) and high&#8208;entropy energy harvesting (device driving via Triboelectric Nanogenerator&#8208;Voltage Management Circuit systems).








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature insulation/energy storage applications boost the rapid development of polymer dielectrics such as polyimide (PI) with excellent thermal stability. However, PI exhibits significant leakage current due to intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;chain charge transfer complexes (CTCs), which seriously increases the risk of thermal runaway. Although single charge transfer inhibition strategies have been developed, the results remain unsatisfying due to the &#8220;short&#8208;board effect in carrier suppression.&#8221; Herein, a &#8220;carrier localization&#8221; approach is introduced that synergistically regulates both intramolecular and intermolecular CT suppression. Thanks to molecular engineering and a directional intercalation structure, the all&#8208;organic polyimide dielectric materials with multidimensional carrier migration suppression achieve an exceptional breakdown strength of 878.9&#160;kV&#160;mm&#8722;1 and Ud of 8.93&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C and energy density of 5.64 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 200&#160;&#176;C (&#951; &gt; 90%), outperforming many reported systems. The all&#8208;organic polyimide dielectric materials also enable to possess high charge density (215 &#181;C&#160;m&#8722;2) when integrated into a self&#8208;excited triboelectric nanogenerator, which is highly desirable for the harvesting of low&#8208;frequency, irregular mechanical energy from a high&#8208;entropy environment. Collectively, this work provides a solid foundation for advanced energy storage and conversion applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-temperature insulation/energy storage applications boost the rapid development of polymer dielectrics such as polyimide (PI) with excellent thermal stability. However, PI exhibits significant leakage current due to intra- and inter-chain charge transfer complexes (CTCs), which seriously increases the risk of thermal runaway. Although single charge transfer inhibition strategies have been developed, the results remain unsatisfying due to the &#8220;short-board effect in carrier suppression.&#8221; Herein, a &#8220;carrier localization&#8221; approach is introduced that synergistically regulates both intramolecular and intermolecular CT suppression. Thanks to molecular engineering and a directional intercalation structure, the all-organic polyimide dielectric materials with multidimensional carrier migration suppression achieve an exceptional breakdown strength of 878.9&#160;kV&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of 8.93&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 150&#160;&#176;C and energy density of 5.64 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 200&#160;&#176;C (&lt;i&gt;&#951;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;gt; 90%), outperforming many reported systems. The all-organic polyimide dielectric materials also enable to possess high charge density (215 &#181;C&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) when integrated into a self-excited triboelectric nanogenerator, which is highly desirable for the harvesting of low-frequency, irregular mechanical energy from a high-entropy environment. Collectively, this work provides a solid foundation for advanced energy storage and conversion applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High Performing Ambipolar Organic Electrochemical Transistors and Solid&#8208;State Inverters Enabled by Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Side Chains Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record&#8208;high &#181;C* and normalized transconductance are achieved based on DPP&#8208;V&#8208;based ambipolar polymers with hydrophilic/hydrophobic side&#8208;chain integration, with balanced n/p&#8208; type performance in ambipolar OECTs and a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1 in aqueous electrolytes. Single&#8208;component polymer also enables SS&#8208;OECTs with high transconductance and antiambipolar behavior, achieving a record&#8208;high SS&#8208;inverter gain of 163&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, setting a benchmark for solid&#8208;state bio&#8208;integrated electronic circuits. 








Abstract
Progress in solid&#8208;state organic electrochemical transistors (SS&#8208;OECTs) and complementary circuits is limited by the lack of high&#8208;performance single component ambipolar mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (AMIECs). Herein, two DPP&#8208;V&#8208;based terpolymers, p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05)&#160;and&#160;p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B20) are designed, featuring an ambipolar backbone and tunable integrated hydrophilic/hydrophobic side&#8208;chain engineering to optimize mixed conduction. Both polymers exhibited state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ambipolar performance in aqueous OECTs, with p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05) demonstrating the record &#181;C* values of 384.8&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (n&#8208;type) and 691.7 F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 (p&#8208;type), along with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art normalized transconductance of 72.6 S&#160;cm&#8722;1for n&#8208;type.&#160;These exceptional performances are attributed to the synergistic enhancement of electronic mobility and optimized ion capacity. Aqueous inverters based on single&#8208;component p(gDPP&#8208;V&#8208;B05) delivered a high voltage gain of 393&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, benefiting from well&#8208;balanced n/p&#8208;type characteristics. Notably, this material also enabled high&#8208;performing SS&#8208;OECTs, which retained strong transconductance and current output, and exhibited typical antiambipolar behavior. Furthermore, single&#8208;component solid&#8208;state inverters (SS&#8208;inverters) achieved a record&#8208;high voltage gain of 163&#160;V&#160;V&#8722;1, representing the first SS&#8208;inverters based on AMIECs and the highest value reported for SS&#8208;inverter systems to date. These results underscore the effectiveness of the molecular design strategy and highlight the promise of ambipolar polymeric mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) for scalable, solid&#8208;state, bio&#8208;integrated electronic circuits.

         <title>Stabilizing Frustrated Phase Transitions in Selective Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using multimodal operando spectromicroscopy, the frustrated phase transition responsible for selective oxidation over cobalt oxide spinel catalysts is identified, corresponding to combined surface reaction and Mars&#8208;van Krevelen (MvK) dynamics. This regime is disrupted by the formation of mobile vacancies and the depletion of active oxygen at high temperatures. Co&#8208;feeding water vapor mitigates these effects, thereby enhancing both selectivity and lifetime.








Abstract
Frustrated phase transitions represent the ideal working state of a heterogeneous catalyst. These states exist within a narrow parameter window, making them difficult to stabilize. Here, it is shown for the selective oxidation of 2&#8208;propanol to acetone over Co3O4 spinels that the addition of water extends the stability regime of the relevant frustrated phase transition. This conclusion is based on results obtained from multi&#8208;modal experiments, including operando scanning electron microscopy (OSEM), near ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP&#8208;XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and computer vision analysis. It is found that the most selective state for acetone formation coincides with a dynamic spinel structure that fluctuates through reversible redox processes. At elevated temperatures, this metastable state undergoes a complete phase transition into the rock&#8208;salt CoO phase characterized by low acetone selectivity. This process is found to be mediated by the generation of mobile vacancies. The addition of water vapor mitigates vacancy mobility and stabilizes the selective, but thermodynamically frustrated, state. As such, the study conceptualizes a strategy to extend the lifetime of a catalyst during reaction by the adequate addition of a co&#8208;reactant.

         <title>Engineered Cryo&#8208;Shocked Cancer Cells Deliver Dual&#8208;Function Gene Medicines for Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering integrated platform for melanoma immunotherapy is presented using cryo&#8208;shocked cancer cells as a targeted &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; delivery system. This nanocarrier transports a novel dual&#8208;function plasmid that co&#8208;delivers the chemokine CXCL9 and a PCSK9 adenine base editor, synergistically enhancing T&#8208;cell infiltration and activation to achieve strong antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Immunotherapies for melanoma are frequently hindered by resistance to immune checkpoint blockade and poor infiltration of T cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these limitations,&#160;a novel dual&#8208;function plasmid is designed, termed CXCL9&#8208;ABEPCSK9, that combines adenine base editing to knock down PCSK9 (a newly identified immunosuppressive factor that impairs CD8&#8314; T cell activity) with overexpression of the chemokine CXCL9, known for its role in recruiting T cells. The plasmid is first encapsulated into a liposome and then loaded on the liquid nitrogen&#8208;treated (LNT) tumor cells, generating LNT@LipoC9AP particles. These LNT cells maintain structural integrity and tumor&#8208;homing properties, functioning as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; delivery system, while losing pathogenicity. It is find that LNT@LipoC9AP effectively increased CD8+ T cell tumor infiltration and exhibited potent antitumor effects in vitro and in vivo. To further improve tumor targeting, LNT@LipoC9AP is engineered by decorating the LNT cell surface with RGD4C peptides, yielding R&#8208;LNT@LipoC9AP, which targets &#945;v&#946;3 integrins commonly overexpressed in melanoma. R&#8208;LNT@LipoC9AP demonstrated superior tumor accumulation, enhanced therapeutic efficacy, and a favorable safety profile. Altogether, the LNT cell&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system for CXCL9 and ABEPCSK9 overcomes the limitations of current tumor immunotherapy and may serve as a promising gene therapy strategy for solid tumors treatment.

The resulting sensors exhibit tunable performance through laser&#8208;induced microstructural engineering. By constructing a sensor array on a hemispherical surface, the authors further demonstrate the potential of this approach for curved&#8208;surface strain mapping and deformation reconstruction.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are capable of accurately mapping deformation across object surfaces, serving as critical components in structural health monitoring and failure mitigation across diverse systems. However, the inherent geometric complexity and non&#8208;uniformity of real&#8208;world surfaces pose significant challenges to conformal sensor integration. Moreover, conventional strain sensors face inherent trade&#8208;offs among sensitivity, detection range, and tunability, limiting their adaptability in practical applications. This study introduces a laser direct writing strategy that combines material and process innovations to enable scalable fabrication of strain sensors on preformed stretchable curved surfaces. Precise control of laser&#8208;induced microstructures allows programmable tuning of electromechanical properties, enabling selective behaviors such as high linearity, strain insensitivity, or pronounced resistance changes at small strains. The resulting devices exhibit a high gauge factor of up to 106, a strain detection range exceeding 100%, a minimum detectable strain of 0.1%, and excellent linearity (correlation coefficient &gt; 0.98) within defined operational ranges. As a proof of concept, a sensor array is implemented for strain mapping and deformation reconstruction on a hemispherical 3D stretchable substrate, demonstrating the capability of this approach for high&#8208;resolution strain monitoring on complex, non&#8208;planar geometries.

         <title>Janus Nanohybrids Enable Superflash Warming and High&#8208;Affinity Ice Confinement for Cross&#8208;Scale Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a Janus nanocryoprotectant featuring a heterogeneous cranial and corporal structure, achieving 98.4% ice recrystallization inhibition and record&#8208;high superflash warming rates across various scales. It effectively addresses key challenges in cross&#8208;scale cryopreservation of commercial cell cryopackages, offering significant advancements for cell therapy and organ transplantation.








Abstract
Strong hydration of cryoprotective agents reduces the glass transition temperature of water and suppresses ice formation. However, lethal cooling and warming remain a critical obstacle to cross&#8208;scale cryopreservation of clinical biospecimens. Herein, a snowman&#8208;like Janus nanohybrid composed of magnetic iron tetraoxide and photothermal polypyrrole is reported. Its cranial&#8211;corporal asymmetry enables heterogeneous hydration for a record high efficiency of ice confinement, reducing mean ice crystal area by 98.4%. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that Janus architecture simultaneously enhances interactions with ice and strengthens the local hydration anisotropy, accounting for the effective inhibition of ice growth. Superflash warming over 920&#160;&#176;C min&#8210;1 by magnetically rotating its anisotropic structure for uniform heat dissipation narrows the hostile temperature window in micro&#8208;/macroscopic scenarios, as further confirmed by Monte Carlo modeling. This design enables cost&#8208;effective post&#8208;thaw magnetic retrieval, eliminating the need for heavy centrifuges, well&#8208;suited for scalable and on&#8208;site applications. As a result, cryopreserved samples from single cells, bacteria, to porcine trachea retain near&#8208;complete viability and functionality. Therefore, this study offers a promising technique to bridge the gap between microscale cell storage and whole&#8208;organ preservation.

         <title>3D Flat Band in Ultra&#8208;Thin Kagome Metal Mn3Sn Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy have been used to demonstrate that ultra&#8208;thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn exhibit a robust dispersionless 3D flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV.Importantly, manganese defect engineering was used to demonstrate chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level. The realization of a robust three&#8208;dimensional kagome band in an ultra&#8208;thin kagome metal is an important step towards observing kagome&#8208;lattice derived strongly correlated topological and quantum phases when the flat band is tuned to the Fermi level, with implications for quantum computing, spintronics, and low&#8208;energy electronics.








Abstract
Flat bands with narrow energy dispersion can give rise to strongly correlated electronic and topological phases, especially when located at the Fermi level. Whilst flat bands are experimentally realized in 2D twisted van der Waals heterostructures, they are highly sensitive to twist angle, necessitating complex fabrication techniques. Geometrically frustrated kagome lattices have emerged as an attractive alternative platform as they can natively host flat bands that are observed experimentally in quasi&#8208;2D bulk&#8208;crystal kagome metals. An outstanding experimental question is whether flat bands can be realized in ultra&#8208;thin metals, with opportunities for stronger electron&#8211;electron interactions through tuning of the surrounding dielectric environment. Here, angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning tunnelling microscopy, and band structure calculations are used to show that ultra&#8208;thin films of the kagome metal Mn3Sn host a robust dispersionless flat band with a bandwidth of 50 meV. Furthermore, chemical tuning of the flat band to near the Fermi level via manganese defect engineering is demonstrated. The realization of tunable kagome&#8208;derived flat bands in an ultra&#8208;thin kagome metal represents a promising platform to study strongly correlated and topological phenomena, with applications in quantum computing, spintronics and low&#8208;energy electronics.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Photoactivatable Cobalt(III) Nanoparticles for Photoactivated Metal Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

This study presents new insights on NIR&#8208;II accelerated prodrug reduction of Co(III) nanoparticles by co&#8208;assembling of a pseudo&#8208;conjugated polymer with Co(III) in the polymer main chain, and NIR&#8208;II phototriggered effective photothermal therapy synergistic photo&#8208;activated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photoactivated cobalt(III) (Co(III)) complexes have great potential for cancer therapy due to their unique interactions with cancer cells. However, its clinical application remains limited by its high toxicity due to low spatial&#8208;temporal control. Here, a second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photoactivated Co(III) nanoparticles (NanoCo) is shown. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NanoCo is capable of generating photothermal heat to accelerate the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II). Under hypoxic conditions, NanoCo is 166 times more effective than cisplatin at killing platinum&#8208;resistant A549DDP tumor cells. Notably, when exposed to 1064&#160;nm irradiation, NanoCo becomes 5000 times more effective than oxaliplatin at killing CT26 cells under normoxic conditions. NanoCo accumulates at the tumor site, generating photothermal heat and killing tumor cells under 1064&#160;nm irradiation. Additionally, NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation triggers immunogenic cell death, further stimulating dendritic cell maturation and inducing anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. The combination of Pt(IV) nanoparticles (HSA@Pt) with NanoCo under 1064&#160;nm irradiation achieves a 99% tumor growth inhibition rate in a 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model. This work is the first to introduce Co(III) complexes activated by NIR&#8208;II light for photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Handed Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Polymer Fiber&#8208;Confined and Stabilized Perovskite Nanocrystals in Hydrated Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;handed circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) composite is achieved by confining perovskite nanocrystals within polymer nanofibers and integrating them into a chiral cellulose nanocrystal framework. The nanofiber confinement enables high photoluminescence efficiency, mechanical robustness, and tunable CPL handedness from a single left&#8208;handed structure for advanced optical encryption applications.








Abstract
Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is of interest for optical encryption and anticounterfeiting applications. However, achieving dual&#8208;handed CPL emission from perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) in hydrated chiral liquid crystal systems remains a challenge because of their susceptibility to water&#8208;induced degradation and disruption of liquid crystal ordering. These issues limit luminescence efficiency, structural integrity, and chiroptical control. Here, a confinement strategy is presented using polymer&#8208;encapsulated perovskite nanofibers, which isolate PNCs from water while supporting the in situ self&#8208;assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into a cholesteric photonic framework. The resulting solid&#8208;state composite achieves high photoluminescence quantum yield (65.56%), mechanical strength (32.15&#160;MPa), and a broad dissymmetry factor range (glum from &#8722;0.96 to +0.49) from a single left&#8208;handed cholesteric structure. Importantly, by engineering the reflectivity of asymmetric bilayer architectures, the composite exhibits enhanced dual&#8208;handed CPL emission depending on the viewing direction. The multimodal optical properties demonstrated here highlight the potential of this system in optical encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.

These issues limit luminescence efficiency, structural integrity, and chiroptical control. Here, a confinement strategy is presented using polymer-encapsulated perovskite nanofibers, which isolate PNCs from water while supporting the in situ self-assembly of cellulose nanocrystals into a cholesteric photonic framework. The resulting solid-state composite achieves high photoluminescence quantum yield (65.56%), mechanical strength (32.15&#160;MPa), and a broad dissymmetry factor range (g&lt;sub&gt;lum&lt;/sub&gt; from &#8722;0.96 to +0.49) from a single left-handed cholesteric structure. Importantly, by engineering the reflectivity of asymmetric bilayer architectures, the composite exhibits enhanced dual-handed CPL emission depending on the viewing direction. The multimodal optical properties demonstrated here highlight the potential of this system in optical encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Selected Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction defines the vector spin chirality in Mn3Sn thin films, enabling deterministic control of the anomalous Hall conductivity polarity. Combining experiments, symmetry analysis, and atomistic simulations, this study reveals a chirality&#8208;selected noncollinear antiferromagnetic state stabilized by interfacial engineering, offering a pathway to controllable Berry&#8208;curvature phenomena in antiferromagnets.








Abstract
The topological noncollinear antiferromagnet (AFM) Mn3Sn exhibits a giant anomalous Hall conductance (AHC) originating from its nonvanishing Berry curvature. Conventionally, the two AHC states are regarded as time&#8208;reversal pairs coupled to the magnetic octupole moment, and their control has relied on reversing this moment by external magnetic fields or electric currents. Here, an alternative mechanism is demonstrated&#8212;the chirality&#8208;selected noncollinear antiferromagnetic state&#8212;in which the AHC polarity is defined by the vector spin chirality (VSC) of the Kagome lattice. By constructing Mn3Sn/Pt heterostructures, a Fert&#8211;Levy&#8211;type Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) is introduced that sets the lattice chirality. The induced DMI changes the VSC from counterclockwise (CCW) to clockwise (CW), resulting in a corresponding inversion of the AHC sign. This behavior is confirmed by symmetry analysis and atomistic simulations that link the polarity inversion to the competition between DMI energy and intrinsic anisotropy. These findings establish a chirality&#8208;defined route for controlling noncollinear antiferromagnetic order and highlight DMI engineering as a powerful means of tailoring Berry&#8208;curvature&#8208;driven transport in AFMs.

         <title>La(OH)3&#8208;Based Lithium Ionic Conductor for Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Hydroxide&#8208;based Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) conductor is first designed and synthesized. The LSLOH is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective compared to existing inorganic electrolytes, and shows Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. The pouch cell with polymer&#8208;inorganic electrolyte delivers 146&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 reversible capacity over 200 cycles, showing the potential for quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (QSSLMBs) hold great promise for next&#8208;generation energy storage but face major challenges for applications, including air instability of electrolytes, high synthesis cost, and poor interfacial compatibility. Here, La(OH)3&#8208;based Li+ conductor Li0.15Sr0.525La0.6(OH)3 (LSLOH) is reported, which is air&#8208;stable and cost&#8208;effective. LSLOH serves as an ionic conductor exhibiting Li&#8314; conductivity of 0.1&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C. To improve interfacial transport, LSLOH is incorporated into a polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;LiTFSI polymer electrolyte (PL) to form a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PL&#8208;LSLOH). LSLOH provides additional Li&#8314; transport channels, while La3+ and Sr2+ interact with TFSI&#8722; to promote Li&#8314; mobility. Moreover, LSLOH induces the formation of a LiOH and Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, effectively suppressing Li dendrite growth. As a result, the LiNi0.6Co0.1Mn0.3O2 | PL&#8208;LSLOH | Li pouch cells achieve 2.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.83&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (with cathode loading of 19&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) over 200 cycles with 92.5% initial capacity retention, underscoring the potential for scale&#8208;up. For the first time, this work demonstrates La(OH)3&#8208;based lithium ionic conductors and electrolyte design that address key barriers to the QSSLMBs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Enhanced Sonodynamic Therapy: Synergizing Cavitation Amplification and Efficient Sonoluminescence&#8208;to&#8208;ROS Conversion for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;enhanced sonodynamic therapy strategy that simultaneously amplifies acoustic cavitation and optimizes sonoluminescence&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion is exploited. The developed pH&#8208;responsive nano&#8208;sonosensitizer combines an acid&#8208;activated carrier with an aggregation&#8208;induced emission sonosensitizer, achieving potent ROS generation. This system demonstrates remarkable therapeutic efficacy, significantly inhibiting orthotopic breast tumor growth through enhanced sonodynamic effects.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), as a promising noninvasive therapeutic modality with superior penetration depth, receives tremendous attention. To date, the widely accepted mechanism for reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in SDT involves acoustic cavitation&#8208;triggered sonoluminescence (SL), followed by the SL&#8208;activation of sonosensitizers. However, current research on sonosensitizer development primarily focuses on promoting SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion, overlooking the essential role of the cavitation process. To fully unleash the potential of SDT, herein, a dual&#8208;enhanced strategy that harnesses the enhanced cavitation for SL generation and efficient SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion is developed for the first time to realize an all&#8208;around enhancement of SDT. Specifically, the proposed nano&#8208;sonosensitizer, namely MeTTh&#8208;PAE NPs, is released as hydrophobic aggregates with a rough surface in response to an acidic environment, allowing for highly enhanced cavitation&#8208;triggered SL under ultrasound. Meanwhile, as a typical aggregation&#8208;induced emission molecule, MeTTh demonstrates a highly promoted intersystem crossing process at its aggregated state, facilitating efficient SL&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion. Notably, combining these two fascinating attributes in MeTTh&#8208;PAE NPs results in an excellent sonodynamic antitumor effect in both in vitro and in vivo. This work proposes a novel strategy to fully exploit the potential of SDT and provides valuable insights for advancing the design of nano&#8208;sonosensitizers.

         <title>A One&#8208;Pot Carbonyl&#8208;Functionalization Strategy for Hybrid Multi&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Towards Highly Efficient Narrowband Blue and Yellow&#8208;Green OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a novel one&#8208;pot method is developed for introducing carbonyls into the B/N&#8208;based MR&#8208;TADF molecule BCzBN, yielding blue&#8208;emitting BN&#9472;CO. BN&#9472;CO is further converted into yellow&#8208;green BN&#8208;CN via iron&#8208;catalyzed aza&#8208;annulation, which combines B/N&#8208;based and imine/amine&#8208;based structures. Both molecules showed narrower spectra compared with their B/N&#8208;based precursors as well as good OLED performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed MR hybridization design.








Abstract
The incorporation of fused carbonyl structures into multi&#8208;resonance (MR) molecular frameworks is a promising strategy for precise emission color tuning and spectral narrowing. However, few molecules have been developed through this strategy, primarily because of the harsh reaction conditions required for carbonyl&#8208;related reactions. Herein, a feasible one&#8208;pot synthetic approach is reported for embedding carbonyl groups as lockers in B/N&#8208;based skeletons under mild conditions, yielding BN&#8208;CO, a blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR emitter. Owing to enhanced molecular planarity and rigidity, BN&#8208;CO exhibits an emission maximum (&#955;e) of 462 nm with an ultra&#8208;narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16 nm. These carbonyl groups also function as versatile modification sites. Subsequent aza&#8208;annulation affords a yellow&#8208;green&#8208;emitting BN&#8208;CN (&#955;e = 546 nm, FWHM = 26 nm), which uniquely combines imine/amine with B/N MR characteristics while exhibiting a significant 84 nm emission red&#8208;shift. The corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit high maximum EQEs (33.5% for BN&#8208;CO and 38.0% for BN&#8208;CN). Notably, BN&#8208;CN&#8208;based devices exhibit extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;offs (EQE = 34.2% at 100,000 cd/m2) and a maximum luminance of 5.61&#215;10&#8309; cd/m2. The proposed approach provides a versatile route for fabricating novel MR architectures and enables the use of carbonyl groups as tunable modification sites facilitating molecular engineering.

     alt="A One-Pot Carbonyl-Functionalization Strategy for Hybrid Multi-Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitter Towards Highly Efficient Narrowband Blue and Yellow-Green OLEDs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, a novel one-pot method is developed for introducing carbonyls into the B/N-based MR-TADF molecule BCzBN, yielding blue-emitting BN&#9472;CO. BN&#9472;CO is further converted into yellow-green BN-CN via iron-catalyzed aza-annulation, which combines B/N-based and imine/amine-based structures. Both molecules showed narrower spectra compared with their B/N-based precursors as well as good OLED performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed MR hybridization design.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of fused carbonyl structures into multi-resonance (MR) molecular frameworks is a promising strategy for precise emission color tuning and spectral narrowing. However, few molecules have been developed through this strategy, primarily because of the harsh reaction conditions required for carbonyl-related reactions. Herein, a feasible one-pot synthetic approach is reported for embedding carbonyl groups as lockers in B/N-based skeletons under mild conditions, yielding BN-CO, a blue boron/nitrogen/carbonyl hybrid MR emitter. Owing to enhanced molecular planarity and rigidity, BN-CO exhibits an emission maximum (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;) of 462 nm with an ultra-narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 16 nm. These carbonyl groups also function as versatile modification sites. Subsequent aza-annulation affords a yellow-green-emitting BN-CN (&#955;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; = 546 nm, FWHM = 26 nm), which uniquely combines imine/amine with B/N MR characteristics while exhibiting a significant 84 nm emission red-shift. The corresponding organic light-emitting diodes exhibit high maximum EQEs (33.5% for BN-CO and 38.0% for BN-CN). Notably, BN-CN-based devices exhibit extremely low efficiency roll-offs (EQE = 34.2% at 100,000 cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a maximum luminance of 5.61&#215;10&#8309; cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The proposed approach provides a versatile route for fabricating novel MR architectures and enables the use of carbonyl groups as tunable modification sites facilitating molecular engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of Solvation and Interfacial Chemistry via Monofluorinated Cations Enables High&#8208;Voltage and Safe Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>

A novel localized moderate&#8208;concentration ionic liquid electrolyte, derived from the monofluorinated ionic liquid, has been developed that exhibits superior safety performance and good compatibility with lithium metal anodes and Ni&#8208;rich cathodes.








Abstract
The fluorine&#8208;rich electrode electrolyte interphase, chemically sourced from fluorinated anions and solvents, plays a pivotal role in improving the cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) equipped with Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. To prestore fluorine source on cations, here a novel monofluorinated cationic skeleton has been designed and synthesized. Its role is first investigated in the regulation of solvation structure and evolution in both bulk and interface regions. The monofluorinated cation can compete with lithium ions for coordinating electrolyte molecules, which improves the oxidative stability of solvents on the cathode surface and prevents the undesirable transition from the anion&#8208;rich to anion&#8208;deficient structure at the anode interface induced by the interfacial electric field. By leveraging this ionic liquid architecture carrying fluorine in both cation and anion, A localized moderate&#8208;concentration ionic liquid electrolyte (LMCILE) is developed that exhibits exceptional compatibility with lithium metal anodes and superior safety characteristics. LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2|LMCILE|Li (4.5&#160;V) cells display excellent cycle stability with a good capacity retention of 82.9% over 950 cycles. The Ni&#8208;rich LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2|LMCILE|Li (4.5&#160;V) system also delivers good electrochemical performance with high capacity retention of 91.4% after 300 cycles and 90.3% after 200 cycles, even at 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Hyperthermia: Diamond Quantum Thermometry Reveals Thermal Control of Macrophage Polarization</title>

         <dc:description>
Photothermal nanodiamonds with quantum sensing capabilities generate lysosome&#8208;confined hyperthermia, enabling simultaneous temperature and radical detection via diamond sensing. This localized thermal and oxidative stress drives pro&#8208;inflammatory (M1) macrophage polarization, revealing a new strategy for precision immunomodulation through subcellular control of heat and redox signaling.








Abstract
Fever elevates body temperature to enhance immune response; however, intracellular temperature can fluctuate by up to 15&#160;&#176;C, suggesting a previously unrecognized layer of thermal regulation. While hyperthermia has long been exploited in medicine, how localized temperature gradients influence cellular fate remains poorly understood. Here, a dual&#8208;function nanodiamond platform is introduced that integrates optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) thermometry with croconium&#8208;dye&#8208;based photothermal heating to precisely modulate temperature within endo&#8208;lysosomal compartments of macrophages. Controlled intracellular hyperthermia triggers oxidative stress, transcriptional reprogramming, and polarization toward a pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype, as confirmed by immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, and transcriptomics. These findings reveal intracellular thermal gradients as active regulators of immune signaling and gene expression. By establishing a direct subcellular thermal trigger for immune activation, independent of the canonical heat&#8208;shock pathway. This work introduces a quantum&#8208;enabled strategy for probing and programming cellular thermodynamics at the nanoscale.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Nanogold: Non&#8208;Close Packed Square Planes in A&#8242;B&#8242; Stacking with a 0.5 &#197; Channel</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure. This work presents an unusual non&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase attained in a 40&#8208;atom gold nanocluster, which is in contrast with the close&#8208;packed fcc quasi&#8208;isomer. The non&#8208;compact structure exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence, possessing a unique 0.5 &#197; channel. Its photoexcited state lifetime is nearly two orders of magnitude shorter than that of the fcc isomer.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering of inorganic materials is one of the most important strategies for achieving new material properties and functionality. Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure, and it remains challenging to create new phases, but recent research on nanogold has provided exciting opportunities by achieving 2H (note: H denotes hexagonal), 4H, and body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal (bct) phases. In the current work, an unusual non&#8208;compact phase in 40&#8208;atom gold nanoclusters is reported, which is in contrast to the close&#8208;packed isomer of fcc structure. The non&#8208;compact isomer exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence giving rise to a unique 0.5 &#197; channel, whereas the fcc isomer is composed of close&#8208;packed planes with a closed structure (i.e., no 1D channel). The two Au40 isomers lead to a nearly two orders of magnitude difference in electronic excited&#8208;state lifetime. The attainment of the new non&#8208;compact phase in nanogold presents potential opportunities in terahertz emission owing to the strong electron&#8208;vibration coupling, ion channeling and ion selection, artificial photosynthesis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Molecular Regulation of Perovskite Crystallization Enables Efficient and Stable FAPbI3 Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uncontrolled nucleation and growth in perovskite films often result in defective morphologies, degrading device efficiency and stability. Diphenyl carbonate (DPC) acts as a dual&#8208;functional crystallization regulator, employing synergistic covalent (carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+) and non&#8208;covalent (aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+) interactions to control film formation. Consequently, DPC&#8208;modified PSCs achieve a PCE of 26.61% (certified: 26.21%). Mini&#8208;modules (active area: 14.0 cm2) incorporating DPC also reach 21.24% PCE.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies, yet their performance is critically constrained by uncontrolled crystallization, which generates suboptimal film morphologies and abundant defects. In this study, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is introduced as a dual&#8208;functional molecular regulator that simultaneously governs nucleation and growth in FAPbI3 films. Through synergistic covalent carbonyl&#8208;Pb2+ coordination and non&#8208;covalent aromatic &#960;&#8208;Pb2+ interactions, DPC promotes controlled PbI2 pre&#8208;aggregation to lower the nucleation barrier, while its strong precursor binding retards subsequent crystal growth. This cooperative regulation yields uniform, large&#8208;grain perovskite films with markedly reduced defect densities. Consequently, DPC&#8208;enabled PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.61% (certified 26.21%), outperforming the control devices (23.65%). Scalable mini&#8208;module (14.0&#160;cm2 active area) with DPC achieves a PCE of 21.24%. Furthermore, DPC&#8208;modified devices exhibit outstanding stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h storage under ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;3 accelerated aging conditions and after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking following ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocols. These findings establish a generalizable molecular strategy for overcoming intrinsic crystallization bottlenecks, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward efficient, stable, and scalable deployment.

Consequently, DPC-modified PSCs achieve a PCE of 26.61% (certified: 26.21%). Mini-modules (active area: 14.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) incorporating DPC also reach 21.24% PCE.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are among the most promising photovoltaic technologies, yet their performance is critically constrained by uncontrolled crystallization, which generates suboptimal film morphologies and abundant defects. In this study, diphenyl carbonate (DPC) is introduced as a dual-functional molecular regulator that simultaneously governs nucleation and growth in FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films. Through synergistic covalent carbonyl-Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; coordination and non-covalent aromatic &#960;-Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; interactions, DPC promotes controlled PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pre-aggregation to lower the nucleation barrier, while its strong precursor binding retards subsequent crystal growth. This cooperative regulation yields uniform, large-grain perovskite films with markedly reduced defect densities. Consequently, DPC-enabled PSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.61% (certified 26.21%), outperforming the control devices (23.65%). Scalable mini-module (14.0&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; active area) with DPC achieves a PCE of 21.24%. Furthermore, DPC-modified devices exhibit outstanding stability, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE after 1200&#160;h storage under ISOS-D-3 accelerated aging conditions and after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking following ISOS-L-2 protocols. These findings establish a generalizable molecular strategy for overcoming intrinsic crystallization bottlenecks, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward efficient, stable, and scalable deployment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Chiral COF&#8211;2D Molecular Crystal Heterojunctions for Neuromorphic Circular Polarization Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction integrating a 3D chiral covalent organic framework with a 2D molecular crystal is presented. This design enables chiral&#8208;selective sensing, efficient exciton dissociation, and neuromorphic processing in a single device. The resulting synaptic transistors demonstrate record chiroptical discrimination (gEPSC = 0.73) and photoresponsivity (7.7 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1), facilitating in&#8208;sensor preprocessing for high&#8208;accuracy neuromorphic vision capable of handling noisy environments.








Abstract
Emulating the biological visual system's ability to perceive and preprocess circularly polarized light (CPL) offers transformative opportunities for advanced imaging, quantum communication, and autonomous navigation. However, the implementation of such functionality in artificial systems demands the seamless integration of chiral selective sensing, efficient exciton dissociation, and neuromorphic processing capabilities, a combination that remains beyond the reach of current optoelectronic materials. Herein, a mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunction architecture is presented, integrating a 3D chiral covalent organic framework (COF) with a 2D molecular crystal (2DMC), to overcome these limitations. By constructing a type&#8208;II band&#8208;aligned interface between a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked TpPa&#8208;COF and an air&#8208;stable dithienothiophene&#8208;based 2DMC, the architecture enables directional, ultrafast interlayer charge transfer and efficient exciton dissociation at the interface. The resulting chiroptical synaptic transistor achieves a record polarization discrimination ratio (gEPSC = 0.73) and exceptional photoresponsivity (7.7 &#215; 103 A W&#8722;1), substantially surpassing existing organic CPL&#8208;sensitive detectors. Furthermore, when configured into a 3 &#215; 3 convolutional kernel array, the device enables in&#8208;sensor noise reduction and feature extraction, elevating the classification accuracy of noisy images from 51.5% to 71.2% in the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset. This work establishes an integrated material platform for CPL&#8208;driven neuromorphic vision, bridging chiral photonics with bioinspired computing.

         <title>Green Porphyrin Interface Anchoring Enables &gt;24% Efficiency in n&#8208;i&#8208;p Perovskite Solar Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual&#8208;sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Scaling of n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite photovoltaics to large&#8208;area modules is impeded by intensified nonradiative recombination at the buried interface of perovskite and electron transport layer, resulting in severe carrier transport losses. Therefore, effective and environmentally benign interfacial modifiers are urgently required. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable tetrasulfonated porphyrin interlayer with a strong dipole moment and multiple coordination sites is designed, which can be vertically anchored at the SnO2/perovskite interface via a simple water&#8208;based post&#8208;treatment. Two sulfonic acid groups form robust bonds with Sn atoms in SnO2, while the remaining two coordinate with Pb in the perovskite lattice, passivating interfacial defects. Strong electron&#8208;withdrawing character of sulfonic acid groups imparts the porphyrin with a pronounced intrinsic dipole moment (10.12 D), which significantly promotes rapid and efficient electron extraction and transport from perovskite to SnO2. Consequently, the treated perovskite modules deliver a power conversion efficiency of 24.49% (certified 23.95%), ranking among the highest reported, while small&#8208;area devices reach 26.66%. Notably, after more than 1500&#160;h of maximum power point tracking, the treated device preserves 90% of its initial efficiency. This study demonstrates an environmentally benign interfacial engineering strategy based on dual&#8208;sided chemical coordination, providing a promising pathway toward scalable fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Radiotherapy&#8208;Responsive Peptide Hydrogel for Pulsatile Release of mRNA&#8208;LNPs Synergizes with Immune Activation to Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiotherapy&#8208;responsive peptide hydrogel encapsulating mRNA&#8208;lipid nanoparticles (NBSGel@mLNP) is presented, serving as a single&#8208;injection vaccine platform that spatiotemporally synchronizes radiation&#8208;induced dendritic&#8208;cell recruitment with pulsatile antigen release, thereby amplifying antigen presentation and T&#8208;cell priming to generate durable antigen&#8208;specific immunity and prevent tumor recurrence.








Abstract
Adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) is a widely used treatment after tumor resection to prevent tumor recurrence. A major limitation of ART is the insufficient capacity to elicit durable antitumor immunity, typically due to inadequate tumor&#8208;associated antigen supply. Although mRNA vaccines provide a promising strategy to supplement neoantigens, current delivery systems require multiple injections and lack spatiotemporal synchronization with radiotherapy. Here, a radiotherapy&#8208;responsive peptide hydrogel (NBSGel) is first presented that enables radiation&#8208;synchronized pulsatile release of mRNA&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles (mLNPs). NBSGel is formed by co&#8208;assembling two sulfide&#8208;modified peptides (NapS and BenS) with distinct oxidation sensitivities, yielding stepwise hydrogel disassembly under fractionated radiation. NBSGel@mLNP enables pulsatile mLNP release from a single dose, mimicking multi&#8208;injection vaccination while synchronizing antigen availability with DC recruitment. In tumor postoperative models, NBSGel@mLNP combined with ART markedly amplifies antigen&#8208;specific CD8&#8314; T&#8208;cell responses, reduces tumor relapse by 80%, and prolongs survival, outperforming intramuscular vaccination and non&#8208;pulsatile controls. Tumor rechallenge experiment shows no tumor regrowth in the long&#8208;term surviving mice, confirming a durable anti&#8208;tumor immune memory. This work establishes a materials&#8208;guided paradigm that achieves spatiotemporal synergy between radiotherapy and mRNA&#8208;based immunotherapy through pulsatile antigen delivery, providing a clinically viable strategy for preventing postoperative cancer recurrence.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Electro&#8208;Optic Modulator Based on Chemical&#8208;Vapor&#8208;Deposited Graphene with van der Waals Hybrid Dielectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile integration of a Sb2O3/Al2O3 hybrid dielectric on the chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited (CVD) graphene for the graphene electro&#8208;optic modulators is demonstrated. Benefitting from the preservation of graphene's electronic properties by van der Waals (vdW) Sb2O3/graphene interface, the graphene electro&#8208;absorption modulator shows a 160% higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&#8722;1 &#181;m&#8722;1) and 580% higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). 








Abstract
Graphene&#8208;based optoelectronic devices have shown high bandwidth and easy incorporation in silicon photonics. However, given that graphene is a single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick material with a large surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, the intriguing properties of the graphene optoelectronic devices are very susceptible to surrounding environments, including interfacial states and dangling bonds from dielectrics. This has degenerated the performance of graphene electro&#8208;optic modulators that rely on uniform electrical gating. Herein, a facile integration of a Sb2O3/Al2O3 hybrid dielectric on the chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposited (CVD) graphene is reported for electro&#8208;absorption modulators. The Sb2O3 molecular crystal as interfacial layer enables a homogeneous Al2O3 dielectric growth and a van der Waals (vdW) interface with graphene, which can significantly reduce the interfacial scattering centers (such as dangling bonds) and thus preserves the electronic properties of graphene, showing an averaged carrier mobility (&#956;) of 10880 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and residual carrier concentration (n*) of 1.35 &#215; 1011 cm&#8722;2. In contrast to the device with a single dielectric, the electro&#8208;absorption modulator with the vdW interface shows a 1.6 times higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&#8722;1 &#181;m&#8722;1) and 5.8 times higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). Moreover, modulation rate is up to 30 Gbit s&#8722;1. Our work provides a promising dielectric option for graphene optoelectronic devices.

     alt="High-Speed Electro-Optic Modulator Based on Chemical-Vapor-Deposited Graphene with van der Waals Hybrid Dielectric"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile integration of a Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid dielectric on the chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) graphene for the graphene electro-optic modulators is demonstrated. Benefitting from the preservation of graphene's electronic properties by van der Waals (vdW) Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/graphene interface, the graphene electro-absorption modulator shows a 160% higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 580% higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphene-based optoelectronic devices have shown high bandwidth and easy incorporation in silicon photonics. However, given that graphene is a single-atom-thick material with a large surface-to-volume ratio, the intriguing properties of the graphene optoelectronic devices are very susceptible to surrounding environments, including interfacial states and dangling bonds from dielectrics. This has degenerated the performance of graphene electro-optic modulators that rely on uniform electrical gating. Herein, a facile integration of a Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid dielectric on the chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) graphene is reported for electro-absorption modulators. The Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecular crystal as interfacial layer enables a homogeneous Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dielectric growth and a van der Waals (vdW) interface with graphene, which can significantly reduce the interfacial scattering centers (such as dangling bonds) and thus preserves the electronic properties of graphene, showing an averaged carrier mobility (&lt;i&gt;&#956;&lt;/i&gt;) of 10880 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and residual carrier concentration (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) of 1.35 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In contrast to the device with a single dielectric, the electro-absorption modulator with the vdW interface shows a 1.6 times higher modulation efficiency (0.0054 dB V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 5.8 times higher bandwidth (&#8776;35 GHz). Moreover, modulation rate is up to 30 Gbit s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Our work provides a promising dielectric option for graphene optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
The developed chirality&#8208;sensitive photoelectric conversion strategy enables the construction of multifunctional circularly&#8208;polarized optoelectronic logic gates, supporting 9 distinct logic operations with large dissymmetry factors. These devices demonstrate applications in image processing, max&#8208;pooling simulation, and chiroptical signal processing, offering a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation optical computing.








Abstract
Optoelectronic logic gates, key components in optical computing and optoelectronic integration, are promising for advancing computing performance in the post&#8208;Moore era. Nonetheless, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates still depend largely on complex regulation, showing restricted functionality and intricate configuration. Circularly polarized light offers a promising route toward highly integrated multifunctional optoelectronic logic gates with its high&#8208;dimensional optics. However, existing circularly&#8208;polarized logic gates are hampered by insufficient discrimination ability and difficulty in adjusting functionality, hindering their applications. Here, a chirality&#8208;sensitive photoelectric conversion strategy is demonstrated, and based on which a series of circularly&#8208;polarized optoelectronic logic gates are constructed&#8212;encompassing the majority of logic operations. These devices exhibit an photocurrent dissymmetry factor of 1.86, underpinning their application in efficient image processing tasks, including stylization and edge extraction. Furthermore, their utility is extended to simulating max&#8208;pooling and realizing chiroptical signal processing with high recognition accuracy. This work effectively integrates chiroptics and electronics, paving the way for expanding the horizons of optical computing.

         <title>Lock&#8208;and&#8208;Shield Strategy Enables Stable and Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Tumor&#8208;Targeted Gene Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield system integrates a nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; for stable nucleic acid encapsulation with a hybrid membrane &#8220;shield&#8221; that confers homotypic targeting and fusion&#8208;mediated entry. This dual design protects nucleic acids in circulation, enables tumor&#8208;specific release, and achieves efficient gene silencing with strong antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
A major challenge to effective cancer gene therapy is the absence of delivery systems that both protect nucleic acids in circulation and release them efficiently inside tumor cells. Nucleic acids are rapidly degraded by nucleases, cleared from the blood, and poorly internalized due to size and charge. Existing vectors address parts of this problem but remain limited by cytotoxicity, instability, or inadequate tumor selectivity. Here, a lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield strategy integrating a hyaluronic acid Nanogel with a hybrid membrane shell&#160;(Nanogel@hMVs) is reported. The Nanogel &#8220;lock&#8221; physically entraps nucleic acids with high efficiency (81.6%&#8211;89.2%) and incorporates dual pH/redox&#8208;responsive linkers for controlled release under tumor&#8208;associated conditions. The membrane &#8220;shield&#8221;, derived from tumor cell membranes and fusogenic lipids, reinforces systemic stability, preserves homotypic recognition, and mediates fusion&#8208;driven cytosolic entry, ensuring tumor&#8208;selective and efficient intracellular delivery. Nanogel@hMVs remain stable for 30 days, promote efficient uptake with minimal lysosomal sequestration, and silence Survivin. Across DNAzyme, siRNA, and ASO, they consistently produce potent gene silencing and in vitro antitumor activity. In vivo systemic administration yields preferential tumor accumulation, marked tumor inhibition, and prolonged survival without detectable toxicity. Collectively, Nanogel@hMVs establish a robust, safe, and adaptable lock&#8208;and&#8208;shield platform for systemic nucleic acid delivery in cancer therapy.

         <title>Dual Dynamics Engineering in COF@MOF Enabled by Laser&#8208;Embedded Metallic Clusters for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk embedding of laser&#8208;generated metal clusters in covalent organic framework@metal&#8211;organic framework hybrids simultaneously overcomes the thermodynamic and kinetic barriers in photocatalytic hydrogenation, achieving nearly 100% conversion for selective C&#9552;O reduction and record&#8208;high hydrogen production rates, with general applicability to other metallic clusters and heterostructures.








Abstract
Photocatalytic hydrogenation can convert solar and biomass resources into value&#8208;added chemicals but is hindered by sluggish CO reduction and inadequate photogenerated&#8208;carrier dynamics. Here, bulk embedding of laser&#8208;derived metal clusters into covalent organic framework@metalorganic framework (COF@MOF) hybrids is proposed and validated to overcome these challenges, a process in which the generated active hydrogen species enable near 100% selective hydrogenation of the C&#9472;O bond. In situ laser embedding enables spatial control of clusters within the COF bulk and COF@MOF interfaces, promoting CO over CC reduction. Bulk&#8208;embedded Pt clusters serve as sites on preformed MOF to nucleate COF growth, forming physical and carrier transfer bridges at the heterointerface via optimized band alignment. By virtue of the dual dynamics improvement, present work achieves an unprecedented yield of 100% tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, which is so far the highest value among all furfural hydrogenation catalysts. Further control over the loading of Pt clusters leads to hydrogen production rates up to 125.48 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, solidifying its status as the most active Pt&#8208;based photocatalytic system reported to date. This dual&#8208;dynamics strategy is general and easily adaptable to diverse metallic clusters and heterostructures, offering a versatile route to boost photocatalytic hydrogenation.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Tandem Solar Cells With Conformal Solution&#8208;Processed Perovskite on Fully Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy enables conformal deposition of perovskite via solution&#8208;processing on industrially textured silicon bottom cells. The regulated ratio of cesium in perovskite results in a uniform and fully covered thin film over large&#8208;scale pyramidal textures on silicon bottom cells based on hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon tunneling junctions. This approach enables perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with a certified efficiency of 32.94%.








Abstract
Conformal deposition of perovskite on fully textured silicon bottom cells using low&#8208;cost solution processing remains challenging, limiting the process compatibility and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Herein, this challenge through synergetic engineering of the perovskite composition and tunneling recombination junction (TRJ) is addressed. The utilization of wide bandgap perovskite with high cesium content and silicon heterojunction (SHJ) bottom cell with hydrogenated nanocrystalline silicon (nc&#8208;Si:H) TRJ is found to enable conformal perovskite on fully textured SHJ bottom cells using solution processing. A remarkable PCE of 33.38% (certified 32.94%) is achieved for the tandem, featuring a record short&#8208;circuit current density of 21.21&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The tandem displays excellent stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 2324&#160;h of operation at maximum power point (AM 1.5G, 25&#160;&#176;C).

A remarkable PCE of 33.38% (certified 32.94%) is achieved for the tandem, featuring a record short-circuit current density of 21.21&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The tandem displays excellent stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 2324&#160;h of operation at maximum power point (AM 1.5G, 25&#160;&#176;C).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sustainable Structural Hot&#8208;Melt Adhesives Enabled by Functionalized Crystalline Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, recyclable hot&#8208;melt adhesive is developed from renewable materials. It features functional crystalline lamellae that enhance shear strength and enable closed&#8208;loop recycling. The adhesive also provides excellent water and oxygen barrier properties, meeting both sustainability and performance demands for advanced bonding and sealing applications.








Abstract
Conventional hot&#8208;melt adhesives (HMAs) suffer from low shear strength and poor recyclability, limiting their structural applications. Here, a sustainable HMA system is developed from renewable building blocks that combines strong adhesion with closed&#8208;loop chemical recyclability. Incorporating polar functional groups into crystalline lamellae enables efficient stress transfer through rigid domains, achieving a balance between cohesive and adhesive forces. The resulting sulfur&#8208;based polymers exhibit shear strengths above 14.7&#160;MPa on wood and 15.1&#160;MPa on stainless steel, along with excellent oxygen and water vapor barrier properties suitable for microelectronic encapsulation. Moreover, these materials can be fully depolymerized from a mixed materials system under mild hydrogenation to regenerate the original monomers. This work establishes a design strategy for structural HMAs that unifies high performance, sustainability, and recyclability.

         <title>Stabilizing SnO2 Colloids via Phosphate Buffering for Efficient and Durable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phosphate&#8208;buffered strategy stabilizes the chemical environment of SnO2 colloids, suppressing aggregation and maintaining surface equilibrium. The optimized PSCs achieve a 26.4% PCE and retain over 99% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous MPP tracking.








Abstract
SnO2 nanoparticles (NPs) solutions are considered a highly efficient&#160;inks for fabricating electron transport layers in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solution&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, SnO2 colloids exhibit thermodynamic instability in aqueous solution due to strong van der Waals attractions between nanoparticles, often leading to aggregation and precipitation. Here, a phosphate&#8208;buffered synthesis strategy is reported that effectively stabilizes SnO2 colloids. The phosphate buffer maintains a stable pH during synthesis, dynamically regulating the electrostatic repulsion between nanoparticles to suppress aggregation and promote homogeneous dispersion. This method enables precise control over surface hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies in the resulting SnO2 films, facilitating efficient electron transport and reducing interfacial recombination. As a result, PSCs achieve a high power convertion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% while demonstrating exceptional operational stability. The encapsulated device maintains 99%, 84%, and 95% of their initial efficiency under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1, ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2, and ISOS&#8208;O&#8208;1 protocols, respectively. Furthermore, a perovskite solar module (5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm) with an active area of 12.6&#160;cm2 delivers an impressive PCE of 23.11%. These results highlight the scalability and practical viability of the strategy for developing large&#8208;area, high&#8208;performance photovoltaic modules.

         <title>A Soft Actuator with Simultaneous Ultra&#8208;High Actuation Strain and Power Density Under Human&#8208;Safe Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft actuator responsive to mild, human&#8208;safe stimuli (body temperature) is developed, exhibiting a large actuation strain (88%) and high power density (1960&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1). This performance arises from a liquid crystalline network engineered with an ultra&#8208;high preset strain (2000%) and an orientation gradient, enabling simultaneous enhancement of actuation stress and strain.








Abstract
Diverse soft robotic applications, such as wearable devices, haptic interfaces, artificial muscles, and biomedical systems, require soft actuators to simultaneously deliver large actuation strain (&gt;40%) and high power density (&gt;323&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1) in response to mild, human&#8208;safe stimuli. However, no existing soft actuator system has successfully met these combined requirements. To address this critical gap, body&#8208;temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystalline elastomer (LCE) films are designed with a thickness direction orientation gradient achieved through macromolecular engineering of lightly crosslinked gels during the initial stage of network formation. Using ultrahigh stretch ratios to 2000% and with controlled entropic recovery, the degree of molecular orientation through the film thickness can be established. As a result, the fully crosslinked monodomain LC soft actuator simultaneously provides a high actuation strain of 88% and a high power density of 1960&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 under body&#8208;temperature stimulation, a level of performance unmatched by existing actuators sensitive to mild stimuli. Device&#8208;level demonstrations, including a rotary soft robot and an intelligent safety switch, highlight the actuator's versatility and potential for real&#8208;world integration in next&#8208;generation soft robotic systems.

         <title>Disrupting Complement&#8208;Inflammation Positive Feedback Circuit via Oligonucleotide Hydrogel Microspheres for Reversing Joint Inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following intra&#8208;articular injection, MMP&#8208;9&#8208;responsive hydrogel microspheres release C5 antisense oligonucleotide liposomes, selectively inhibiting complement activation in inflammatory synovial cells, reducing C5a&#8208;driven inflammatory cell activation, and inhibiting immune complexes&#8211;mediated complement reactivation. This multilayer regulation can remodel the RA joint immune microenvironment and significantly delay disease progression by suppressing the complement&#8211;inflammation circuit.








Abstract
The positive feedback circuit between the complement system and inflammatory immune responses maps the malignant progression of chronic joint inflammation. Prolonged dysregulation of the immune microenvironment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) further exacerbates sustained complement activation, thereby establishing a vicious cycle. In this study, MMP&#8208;9&#8208;responsive, injectable micro&#8208;nano geneplexes (C5ASO@HAP&#8208;CL&#8208;TIMP@HMs) are developed for on&#8208;demand regulation of complement component C5, aiming to disrupt this pathological circuit. C5 antisense oligonucleotides (C5ASO) are loaded into cationic liposomes, which are subsequently encapsulated within hyaluronic acid microspheres via click chemistry. In vitro, these geneplexes effectively block abnormal C5 activation in RA synoviocytes, restore macrophage polarization balance, reduce pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels and immune complex precursor molecules, and upregulate anti&#8208;inflammatory mediators. In an adjuvant&#8208;induced arthritis rat model, they significantly alleviate joint swelling and cartilage degradation and suppress inflammatory responses, further highlighting the therapeutic potential of geneplexes in dismantling the complement&#8208;inflammation circuit. In summary, the development of micro&#8208;nano geneplexes capable of precisely disrupting the complement&#8208;inflammatory circuit in RA offers a promising new perspective for the targeted treatment of chronic joint inflammation.

         <title>Synergistic Defect Engineering in Ca&#8208;Based Pellets for Durable and High&#8208;Absorptance Solar Thermochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;scale defect engineering is used to create robust CaCO3$\rm {CaCO_3}$&#8208;based thermochemical pellets that resist high&#8208;temperature sintering while strongly absorbing sunlight. Nanoscale precipitates and lattice strain stabilize the reactive matrix, and Mn&#8208;induced bandgap tuning raises absorptance from 2.9% to 78.5%. The pellets deliver an average of 848.3 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ\ m^{-3}}$ over 217 cycles, enabling compact, durable solar heat storage.








Abstract
Solar thermochemical energy storage (TCES) holds immense promise for a carbon&#8208;neutral future. However, its large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;cost implementation is severely hampered by the poor solar absorptance, rapid performance degradation, and low volumetric energy density of conventional calcium carbonate/oxide materials. Herein, a multi&#8208;scale synergistic defect engineering strategy is proposed to resolve this conflict fundamentally. Guided by predictive ray&#8208;tracing models and density functional theory calculations that pinpoint dopant d&#8208;electron effects as the key modulator of optical properties, Mn/Mg co&#8208;doped pellets are rationally designed. These engineered pellets demonstrate a suite of outstanding properties: a dramatic leap in solar absorptance from a mere 3.4% to 78.5%, a 1.54&#8208;fold enhanced thermal conductivity, and exceptional cycling durability. Over 123 cycles, the pellets achieve a remarkable average volumetric energy density of 877.9 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ\ m^{-3}}$ (2.1 times that of the pristine powder), maintaining a high average of 848.3 MJm&#8722;3$\rm {MJ}\ {\rm m}^{-3}$ over 217 cycles. This unprecedented performance comes from a unique multi&#8208;scale defect synergy, where 0D point defects induce beneficial lattice strain, while in situ formed 3D nano&#8208;precipitates strategically pin 2D grain boundaries to suppress high&#8208;temperature sintering effectively. This work not only delivers a record&#8208;performing TCES material but also establishes a promising, theory&#8208;guided strategy for the intelligent design of next&#8208;generation energy storage&#160;materials.

         <title>Emergent Global&#8208;Pinning Exchange Bias in van der Waals Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates an emergent global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures composed of diverse 2D vdW magnets, achieving long&#8208;range magnetic pinning up to 100&#160;&#181;m via simply partial stacking. By tuning interlayer coupling and coverage ratio, it offers a scalable approach for energy&#8208;efficient spintronic memory devices based on 2D vdW materials.








Abstract
As magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) technology becomes increasingly vital for emerging applications, such as artificial intelligence, the development of cost&#8208;effective and miniaturized solutions is essential. van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which can be vertically stacked with various functional blocks, offer promising potential to enhance the performance and scalability of memory devices. Nevertheless, the need for perfect alignment between adjacent layers and finite local interactions at the interfaces often complicates device architectures and leads to high power consumption. Addressing these challenges, a new device configuration with partial overlap while maintaining the global effect would be a promising scheme. Here, using Fe3GeTe2/MnBi2Te4 (FGT/MBT) as a paradigm, the global&#8208;pinning exchange bias (GPEB) effect is successfully achieved with a horizontal pinning distance approaching 100 &#181;m. Specifically, once stacking a small&#8208;area MBT on FGT, the entire FGT is fully biased due to magnetic couplings inherent to vdW magnets, as confirmed by the theoretical model. Interlayer coupling and coverage ratio provide additional degrees of freedom to manipulate the GPEB. Remarkably, this emergent GPEB effect is prevalent across vdW heterostructures composed of various vdW magnets. This work expands design flexibility and offers strategies for constructing new in&#8208;memory computing devices, opening exciting possibilities for future spintronic applications.

         <title>Microphase&#8208;Separated Hydrogel Electrolytes with Selective Ion Transportation Pathways for Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study presents a microphase&#8208;separated single&#8208;zinc&#8208;ion conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) formed by disentangling polyanionic zinc&#8208;alginate chains using Nafion (ZA/N). The engineered hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains create continuous Zn2+ pathways, yielding high ion selectivity and fast transport. The ZA/N electrolyte enables dendrite&#8208;free cycling and long&#8208;life, deformation&#8208;tolerant flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries, offering a general strategy for high&#8208;performance SIHEs.









Abstract
Flexible aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics and soft robotics, yet their development is hindered by the non&#8208;selective ion transport of conventional hydrogel electrolytes, which induces concentration polarization, uneven Zn2+ flux, and dendrite formation, ultimately causing battery failure. Here, a microphase&#8208;separated single&#8208;zinc&#8208;ion conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) constructed via polymer chain disentanglement within a polyanionic zinc&#8208;alginate (ZA) matrix is reported. Due to the pronounced steric disparity between Zn2+ and the alginate chains, ZA holds intrinsic potential for ion&#8208;selective transport. However, spontaneous chain entanglement within the alginate network under the applied electric field severely impedes the formation of continuous ion transport pathways, limiting Zn2+ conduction. By incorporating Nafion, well&#8208;defined hydrophilic/hydrophobic domains are induced that simultaneously relax the entangled polymer network and establish continuous Zn2+&#8208;conducting pathways. This microstructural engineering enables a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.967 and ionic conductivity of 25.5 mS cm&#8722;1, resolving the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between ion selectivity and transport kinetics. The zinc&#8208;alginate/Nafion (ZA/N) electrolyte enables dendrite&#8208;free cycling for over 4600 h. The ZA/N&#8208;based flexible ZIB retains 90% capacity after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This work presents a general strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance SIHEs for safe and durable flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Geminal&#8208;Atom Coordination for Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu based geminal&#8208;atom catalyst leverages inert carbonate ions in seawater to dynamically reorganize active centers, enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. In situ spectroscopy and theory reveal reversible Cu&#8208;CO32&#8722; coordination and accelerated charge transfer, achieving 17&#8208;fold higher &#183;OH yield, efficient pollutant and Chlorella degradation, and proven environmental and economic sustainability.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and leveraging non&#8208;reactive species in natural environments to modulate the active centers of geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) is crucial for enhancing their catalytic performance. Here, we develop a two&#8208;coordinated copper geminal&#8208;atom catalyst and reveal that the ubiquitous yet inert carbonate ions (CO32&#8722;) in seawater dynamically reorganize the coordination environment of active copper sites, thereby enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. Control experiments, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical modeling demonstrate that CO32&#8722; induces reversible coordination transformations that modulate the electronic structure and facilitate interfacial charge transfer, resulting in a 17&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical production. This effect enables efficient degradation of diverse marine pollutants, including effective Chlorella decomposition under natural sunlight. Life&#8208;cycle and technoeconomic assessments further demonstrate the environmental benefits and economic feasibility of this approach. Overall, this work establishes a generalizable strategy for active geminal&#8208;atom catalysts via environmentally abundant species, offering mechanistic insights and scalable pathways toward large&#8208;scale and sustainable aquatic pollution remediation.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Designed BCZT&#8211;SBT Heterointerface Unlocks Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning guides the design of BCZT&#8211;SBT ceramics that form an atomically thin epitaxial interlayer between perovskite and tungsten bronze phases. This hetero&#8208;barrier suppresses carrier injection while homogenizing polarization, enabling a fatigue&#8208;free performance over 10&#8313; cycles as well as excellent recoverable energy performance. The work establishes a mechanistic route to reliable lead&#8208;free dielectric capacitors.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are attractive for advanced energy storage owing to their ultrafast charge&#8211;discharge capability, yet their practical use is hindered by severe fatigue under repeated operation at ultrahigh electric fields. Achieving fatigue&#8208;free performance therefore represents a key challenge in dielectric design. Here, guided by machine learning (ML), SrBi2Ta2O9 (SBT) is introduced into Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT) to construct a (1&#8208;x)BCZT&#8208;xSBT solid solution. At x = 0.10, the coexistence of perovskite and tungsten bronze phases gives rise to an epitaxial interfacial layer only a few unit cells thick, formed by lattice mismatch. Atomic&#8208;scale analyses reveal that this hetero&#8208;barrier effectively suppresses carrier migration, while the tungsten bronze phase promotes polarization homogenization, together enhancing both voltage endurance and reliability. As a result, 0.90BCZT&#8208;0.10SBT achieves a recoverable energy density (Wrec) of 9.94 J cm&#8722;3 with 92.1% efficiency, and more strikingly, maintains stable performance after 109 charge&#8211;discharge cycles without degradation, enabled by an elevated Schottky barrier. This work not only uncovers the atomic origin of fatigue resistance in lead&#8208;free dielectrics but also establishes a ML&#8208;guided strategy for designing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance, fatigue&#8208;free capacitors for reliable energy storage.

         <title>Quadruple Moir&#233; Pockets in Lateral Heterobilayers: Programmable Phononic Reconfiguration and Anomalous Second Harmonic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable CVD&#8208;grown lateral heterostructures stacked with controllable twist angles form quadruple moir&#233; pockets, enabling programmable tuning of phonon, exciton, and SHG. Material&#8208;selective lattice relaxation modulates strain, interlayer coupling, Davydov splitting, valley polarization, and anomalous SHG enhancement. Such multi&#8208;moir&#233; networks establish a scalable pathway for multifunctional moir&#233; engineering, opening opportunities in opto&#8208;straintronics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and quantum photonics.








Abstract
Moir&#233;&#8208;engineering in 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides offers access to correlated quantum phenomena. However, simultaneous control over twist&#8208;angle (&#952;) and material combinations to tune phonons, excitons, and their collective interactions remains limited. This study presents scalable, quadruple moir&#233;&#8208;pockets formed by vertically stacking chemical vapor deposition&#8208;grown monolayer MoS2&#8211;WS2 and MoSe2&#8211;WSe2 lateral heterostructures with controlled &#952; (0&#8304;&#8211;60&#176;), within a single flatland. Moir&#233; non&#8208;rigidity induces lattice&#8208;relaxation via rotational reconstruction (&#952;&lt;8&#176;) and volumetric dilation (&#952;&gt;8&#176;), resulting in strain&#8208;mediated phonon frequency&#8208;softening and linewidth&#8208;broadening, respectively. Strain localizes selectively in mechanically softer crystal for &#952;&lt;8&#176;, while an epitaxial&#8208;pseudomorphic pattern dominates for &#952;&gt;8&#176;. Degree of phonon&#8208;reconfiguration and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncover the role of interfacial orbitals in modulating interlayer coupling. At aligned angles (&#952;&#8211;0&#176; and 60&#176;), specifically, MoS2 exhibits Davydov splitting and reduced valley polarization, reflecting symmetry breaking and chiral phonon effects. At &#952;&#8211;3&#176;, WS2/WSe2 shows up to 480% enhancement in second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), while WS2/MoSe2 records the lowest due to variations in interlayer&#8208;coherence and band&#8208;offset&#8208;driven phase delay. Notably, at &#952;&#8211;60&#176;, only WS2/MoSe2 exhibits an anomalous 300% SHG enhancement, attributed to large phase delay and reconstruction&#8208;induced strain. Electronic bandstructure calculations support these observations. These findings offer programmable multi&#8208;moir&#233; platforms for opto&#8208;straintronics, sensing, and on&#8208;chip quantum photonics applications.

         <title>Metallophilic Non&#8208;van der Waals Roll&#8208;ups Engineered for Long&#8208;Life Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique metallophilic non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups of transition metal carbides are developed by metal&#8208;bonding MXene roll&#8208;ups via a pulsed Joule&#8208;heating technology. These non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups exhibit high thermal stability and unexpected metallophilic property to molten metals, facilitating the formation of thin metal foils with high mechanical tensile strengths. Moreover, the full cells with these metal hybrid electrodes exhibit a long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Metal hybrid electrodes are promising for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to their high theoretical capacities. However, their practical employment is hampered by the inherent incompatibility between molten metals and composite materials resulting from the high surface tensions. Herein, unique metallophilic non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) roll&#8208;ups of transition metal carbides are produced via metal&#8208;bonding adjacent atomic layers in scrolled MXenes, featuring a nano&#8208;sized hollow structure and abundant surface dangling bonds as well as remarkable thermal stability up to 800&#160;&#176;C. These features enable the formation of chemical bonding and strong capillary forces between the non&#8208;vdW roll&#8208;ups and molten metals such as Li, Ga, Mg, and their alloys, leading to the unexpected metallophilic property. As a result, the surface tensions of metal&#8208;based composites are significantly reduced, facilitating the fabrication of thin metal hybrid foils with high mechanical tensile strengths. For instance, a Mg foil incorporated with non&#8208;vdW Al&#8208;V2CTx roll&#8208;ups exhibits a high tensile strength up to 204&#160;MPa, &#8776;2 times that of bare Mg. When employed as an anode in magnesium batteries, the full cell coupled with the Mo6S8 cathode delivers long&#8208;term cycling stability with &#8776;90.0% capacity retention after 500 cycles at 1 C, attributed to the low diffusion resistance of the hybrid electrode.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Vat Photopolymerization of Ceramics and Metals with Low Shrinkages via Repeated Infusion Precipitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an in situ precipitation strategy for the hydrogel&#8208;based vat photopolymerization of architected ceramics and metals with reduced shrinkages and improved densities. Repeated infusion&#8208;precipitation significantly increases metal loading within the hydrogels, which improves part quality after thermal conversion. This strategy offers a versatile platform for&#160;the fabrication of&#160;advanced structural and functional materials and next&#8208;generation 3D&#8208;architected devices.








Abstract
Vat photopolymerization (VP) is a powerful tool for the fabrication of architected ceramic and metal structures. However, conventional methods of ceramic/metal VP, such as with the use of slurries or organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid resins, have challenges with viscosities, light&#8208;scattering, and limited material compositions. Recently, the use of metal&#8208;salt solutions has emerged as a promising approach for the VP of ceramics and metals. While versatile and accessible, the process is accompanied by a significant amount of shrinkage, which causes warping, porosity, and structural damage. Here, a versatile method is presented for fabricating dense architected ceramics and metals with low conversion linear shrinkages. Central to this method is a post&#8208;fabrication repeated infusion&#8208;coprecipitation process that progressively&#160;increases the metal loading in the 3D &#8220;blank&#8221; hydrogels. Thermal treatment of these high metal content hydrogels then converts them into ceramic or metal architectures. To demonstrate the versatility of this approach, a variety of 3D ceramic and metal structures with shrinkages as low as 20% while maintaining densities &gt;80% is fabricated. This infusion&#8208;precipitation&#8208;based process thus enables the VP of high&#8208;quality ceramics and metals, which is necessary for the fabrication of advanced architected materials and devices.

         <title>Enzymatically Switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing Polymer Conjugate to Coordinate Host Immune Responses in Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis is a potent form of immunogenic cell death that orchestrates innate and adaptive immunity. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is developed that selectively induces gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis in cancer cells via chemiluminescence&#8208;triggered lysosomal disintegration. EPIC enhances dendritic and NK cell activation in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. When combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, EPIC boosts cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration and memory T&#8208;cell formation, achieving durable tumor regression.








Abstract
Gasdermin&#8208;D&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, an immunogenic cell death predominantly occurring in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, is pivotal in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, this dynamic process holds significant potential as an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy. However, its adequate spatiotemporal control in cancer remains challenging. An Enzymatically switchable Pyroptosis&#8208;Inducing polymer Conjugate (EPIC) is reported that selectively triggers chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer (CRET) in the lysosome in the presence of Cathepsin B, abundant in cancer cells. When exposed to cancer cells in vitro, EPIC generates reactive oxygen species via self&#8208;immolation&#8208;mediated CRET, triggering lysosomal membrane disintegration, followed by activation of the signaling cascade that cleaves gasdermin&#8208;D. Cleaved gasdermin&#8208;D forms pyroptotic pores in the cancer cell membrane, promoting the efflux of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns and inflammatory cytokines. When systemically administered into the tumor&#8208;bearing mice, EPIC provokes a robust immune response by promoting dendritic cell maturation and reinvigorating cytotoxic NK cells. Combination of EPIC with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody enhanced infiltration of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells and promoted memory T cells, resulting in a durable remission of established tumors with complete tumor regression in more than half of the treated mice. Overall, EPIC has potential as a nanoplatform with multifaceted advantages for precise and effective cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Magnetic Domain Texture in Fe3O4 Thin Films on SiO2 Nanospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe3O4 thin films grown on ordered SiO2 nanospheres form curved nanocaps with 3D geometry, inducing magnetic domain texture. X&#8208;ray spectromicroscopy (XMCD&#8208;PEEM), cross&#8208;sectional electron microscopy (STEM), and polarized grazing&#8208;incidence small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (GISANS) reveal how topography modulates magnetization. This system provides a new platform to explore geometry&#8208;induced magnetic phenomena at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Topographically complex interfaces offer a promising route to engineer magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with potential implications for next&#8208;generation spintronic and neuromorphic devices. Here, Fe3O4 thin films are grown on self&#8208;assembled SiO2 nanospheres to investigate how local curvature, together with polycrystalline morphology, influence magnetic behavior compared to flat films. STEM and GISANS confirm connected growth with preserved lateral ordering, while XMCD&#8208;PEEM reveals in&#8208;plane magnetic domains that extend across both nanosphere&#8208;patterned and flat regions. Despite the low net magnetization of the Fe3O4 caps, their domain orientations align with neighboring flat areas, indicating correlated domain behavior across structurally different regions. These findings demonstrate how nanoscale topography and morphology can be leveraged as design parameters to modulate magnetism in complex&#160;oxides.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Air&#8208;Stable Polymer Monolayer Transistors for Monolithic 3D CMOS logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fibrillar polymer monolayer with a self&#8208;confinement effect is demonstrated, in which aligned chains parallel the nanofiber axis. Employing a top&#8208;gate CYTOP dielectric, this monolayer transistor achieves high mobility (7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and exceptional stability over 1260 days in air. Furthermore, monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistors is achieved, enabling hybrid complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capability.








Abstract
The monolayer transistor, where the semiconductor layer is a single molecular layer,&#160;offers an ideal platform for exploring transport mechanisms both theoretically and experimentally by eliminating the influence of spatially correlated microstructure.&#160;However, the structure&#8208;property relations in polymer monolayers remain poorly understood, leading to low transistor performance to date. Herein, a&#160;self&#8208;confinement effect is demonstrated in the polymer monolayer with nanofibrillar microstructures and&#160;edge&#8208;on orientation, as characterized by the 4D scanning confocal electron diffraction&#160;method. The polymer chains align parallel to the nanofiber long axis, while the &#960;&#8208;stacking direction aligns perpendicular to this axis. To reduce the trap density at the&#160;semiconductor/dielectric interface, a top&#8208;gate configuration is employed with CYTOP as gate dielectric, and the resulting monolayer transistors achieve a field&#8208;effect mobility&#160;of 7.12 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, an on/off ratio of 10&#8312;, and a subthreshold swing of 0.21&#160;V&#160;dec&#8722;1, among the performance records for polymer monolayer transistors. Notably, the top&#8208;gate&#160;architecture allows self&#8208;encapsulation, and the monolayer network induces the morphologic lock effect, contributing to a remarkable device stability over 1260 days. Additionally, the low thermal budget of this polymer monolayer transistor enables the monolithic 3D integration with n&#8208;type oxide transistor, resulting in hybrid&#160;complementary inverters with reasonable voltage amplification capabilities.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition of 2D Semiconducting Bi2O2S for High&#8208;Performance Field&#8208;Effect Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the successful low&#8208;temperature growth of high&#8208;quality Bi2O2S nanoplates via MOCVD, achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV and high field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs exhibit outstanding on/off ratios, while photodetectors show high responsivity and fast response times, establishing Bi2O2S as a promising candidate for low&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Bi2O2S has emerged as a promising 2D semiconductor for high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) applications, effectively addressing limitations observed in conventional 2D materials, including environmental instability, challenges with achieving optimal bandgaps, and insufficient static power efficiency. However, practical application of Bi2O2S has been hindered by synthesis challenges; previous methods often relied on high&#8208;temperature processes (&gt;700&#160;&#176;C) for precursor sublimation resulting in the formation of undesired phases or solution&#8208;based approaches that compromise material quality. In this work, the growth of single&#8208;crystalline Bi2O2S nanoplates at a low temperature of &#8776;400&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV compatible with Si&#8208;based devices. Fabricated Bi2O2S&#8208;based FETs through this process exhibit excellent electrical performance, with a maximum on/off ratio of 3.6 &#215; 10&#8313; and a field&#8208;effect mobility of 227&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, benefiting from the low effective mass (0.15&#160;m0) inherent to Bi2O2S. Furthermore, Bi2O2S photodetectors display remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, including a high responsivity of 11,577&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, rapid response time in the millisecond range, and a specific detectivity of 1014 Jones. These results confirm Bi2O2S's potential as a versatile semiconductor for next&#8208;generation electronics, offering both BEOL&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature synthesis and high&#8208;speed, low&#8208;power device capabilities.

In this work, the growth of single-crystalline Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nanoplates at a low temperature of &#8776;400&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), achieving a bandgap of 1.2&#160;eV compatible with Si-based devices. Fabricated Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-based FETs through this process exhibit excellent electrical performance, with a maximum on/off ratio of 3.6 &#215; 10&#8313; and a field-effect mobility of 227&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, benefiting from the low effective mass (0.15&#160;m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) inherent to Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Furthermore, Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S photodetectors display remarkable optoelectronic characteristics, including a high responsivity of 11,577&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, rapid response time in the millisecond range, and a specific detectivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. These results confirm Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S's potential as a versatile semiconductor for next-generation electronics, offering both BEOL-compatible low-temperature synthesis and high-speed, low-power device capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immuno&#8208;Packed T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Fusogenic Liposome Empowers Adoptive T Cell Therapy for Solid Tumor Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL) platform is developed to engineer T cells to overcome solid tumor challenges. Using membrane fusion, it simultaneously confers three abilities in one step: enhanced tumor infiltration, immune tolerance evasion, and tumor microenvironment modulation. This approach offers a promising T cell engineering strategy, potentially broadening adoptive T cell therapy's scope against solid tumors.









Abstract
Adoptive T cell therapy has achieved remarkable success in certain blood cancers, but&#160;its efficacy against solid tumors remains limited by multiple immunological challenges including inadequate tumor infiltration, tumor cell's immune tolerance, and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Herein, a one&#8208;step cell engineering strategy is reported to enhance T cell therapy for solid tumors using an immuno&#8208;packed T&#8208;cell&#8208;fusogenic liposome (IMPACTFUL). Through membrane fusion, IMPACTFUL simultaneously decorates therapeutic T cells with DPPA peptides on their surface and delivers interleukin&#8208;12 mRNA&#8208;loaded magnetic nanoparticle cores (MNP/IL&#8208;12) into the cytoplasm. MNP/IL&#8208;12 internalization grants T cells with effective tumor targeting under external magnet and TME reversion through IL&#8208;12 expression. DPPA peptide presentation enables T cells to overcome tumor cells&#8217; immune tolerance through PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade. In a murine solid tumor model, IMPACTFUL&#8208;engineered T cells infiltrate tumors more effectively, resist exhaustion, and induce a more pro&#8208;inflammatory TME, leading to significantly suppressed tumor growth compared to unmodified T cells. Together, IMPACTFUL can empower adoptive T cell therapy by endowing T cells with multiple complementary functions in a single step. This approach offers a versatile platform to improve the therapeutic outcomes of T cell therapies against solid tumors and can accelerate their translation to clinical settings.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Conductivity Enhancement of Robust All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Ion Elastomers via Strain&#8208;Induced Ion Channel Alignment and Temperature&#8208;Activated Ion&#8208;Gated Release</title>

         <dc:description>
Enhancing the electrical conductivity of ionic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state conductors under stretch and temperature&#8208;altering conditions remains challenging. This work simultaneously achieves strain&#8208;induced and temperature&#8208;gated conductivity enhancement by modulating the microphase structure and interfacial interactions through in situ polymerization of polyacrylamide and the introduction of lithium salts in SEBS. With their remarkable conductivity and mechanical properties, flexible strain sensors in a wide temperature and stretching range are realized.








Abstract
Despite their potential in ionic electronics, conventional ionic conductors face critical limitations, including modest strain&#8208;modulated conductivity and restricted self&#8208;regulation under temperature variations. Here, a mechanically robust all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ionic elastomer is presented, engineered through molecular design and microphase separation. By in situ integrating polyacrylamide (PAM) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) into maleic anhydride&#8208;grafted styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;butylene&#8208;styrene (SEBS&#8208;MAH), a hierarchical structure with dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, lithium bonds, and cation&#8208;&#960; effects) is achieved. This design yields exceptional mechanical properties, including a tensile strength of 46.4 MPa, strain of 1066%, and toughness of 207.8 MJ m&#8722;3, alongside outstanding recyclability and puncture resistance. Remarkably, strain&#8208;induced alignment of microphase&#8208;separated domains reduces ion transport tortuosity, enabling a 1300 times conductivity enhancement at 1066% strain. Concurrently, temperature&#8208;gated ion release from confined regions triggers a 1600 times conductivity increase at 120&#160;&#176;C. The elastomer maintains high conductivity (&gt;10&#8722;3 S m&#8722;1) across an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range (&#8722;45&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C), overcoming the limitations of conventional hydrogels and ionogels. This work pioneers a dual&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive strategy for advanced ionic conductors, offering transformative potential in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and adaptive sensors.

         <title>Successive Orthorhombic Distortions in Kagome Metals by Molecular Orbital Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orthorhombic distortions in kagome metals break the symmetry required for exotic charge order. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction of NdRu3Si2 reveals successive orthorhombic transitions driven by molecular orbital formation between kagome layers. The frustrated kagome lattice hosts degenerate patterns of kagome dimers whose short&#8208;range correlations produce diffuse scattering. A chemistry&#8208;based framework provides design principles for realizing structurally pristine kagome metals.








Abstract
The kagome lattice, with its inherent frustration, hosts a plethora of exotic phenomena, including the emergence of 3q charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave order. The high rotational symmetry required to realize such an unconventional charge order is broken in many kagome materials by orthorhombic distortions at high temperature, the origin of which remains much less examined&#160;despite their ubiquity. In this study, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a structural phase transition from a parent hexagonal structure to an orthorhombic ground state, mediated by a critical regime with diffuse scattering in the prototypical kagome metals RRu3Si2 (R = Nd, Pr). Structural analysis uncovers partially ordered bonds between kagome layers in the orthorhombic phases. Accordingly, a short&#8208;range correlated dimer model on the kagome layers reproduces the diffuse scattering, with the short&#8208;range order arising from competing structures induced by the geometrical frustration of the kagome lattice. The observations point to molecular orbital formation between Ru 4dz2$4d_{z^2}$ orbitals as the driving force behind the transition, consistent with ab initio calculations. A framework based on electronegativity and a tolerance factor is proposed to evaluate the stability of the hexagonal phase in various kagome metals, guiding the design of highly symmetric&#160;materials.

         <title>Direct Construction of a LiF&#8208;Rich Interphase for Sustainable Regeneration of Spent Graphite Electrodes via In Situ Decarbonization&#8208;Fluorination Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the failure mechanisms of graphite electrodes and develops a straightforward decarbonization&#8208;fluorination approach, achieving facile recycling and regeneration of graphite electrodes. This work paves the way for more sustainable direct&#8208;recycling technologies for graphite electrodes.








Abstract
Recycling graphite anodes is critical due to the high economic and environmental costs of producing battery&#8208;grade graphite. However, traditional recycling primarily regenerates graphite powder through complex steps like separation and purification. In spent graphite anode materials, the primary cause of electrochemical failure is the surface formation of a thick, poorly conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, a decarbonization&#8208;fluorination strategy is developed to directly regenerate spent graphite electrodes. The process can convert the poorly conductive SEI layer into a highly conductive LiF&#8208;rich layer by reacting Li2CO3 present in the SEI with an NH4F solution. This reconstructed interface boosts ionic conductivity, lowers interfacial resistance, and creates a fast pathway for lithium ions. The regeneration graphite electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 303.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C and a capacity retention of 92.3% after 500 cycles. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)//regenerated graphite pouch cell (550 mAh) shows a 92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C.

&lt;p&gt;This study reveals the failure mechanisms of graphite electrodes and develops a straightforward decarbonization-fluorination approach, achieving facile recycling and regeneration of graphite electrodes. This work paves the way for more sustainable direct-recycling technologies for graphite electrodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recycling graphite anodes is critical due to the high economic and environmental costs of producing battery-grade graphite. However, traditional recycling primarily regenerates graphite powder through complex steps like separation and purification. In spent graphite anode materials, the primary cause of electrochemical failure is the surface formation of a thick, poorly conductive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, a decarbonization-fluorination strategy is developed to directly regenerate spent graphite electrodes. The process can convert the poorly conductive SEI layer into a highly conductive LiF-rich layer by reacting Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; present in the SEI with an NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F solution. This reconstructed interface boosts ionic conductivity, lowers interfacial resistance, and creates a fast pathway for lithium ions. The regeneration graphite electrode exhibits a high specific capacity of 303.9&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.5 C and a capacity retention of 92.3% after 500 cycles. The LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811)//regenerated graphite pouch cell (550 mAh) shows a 92% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, its areal capacity is 4.9 times higher than that of a spent graphite pouch cell. The techno-economic analysis indicates cost reductions &#8776;78% compared to conventional approaches. This work lays the foundation for a more sustainable technology for the direct recovery of graphite electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biocompatible Liquid Crystal Elastomer Optical Fiber Actuator for In Vivo Endoscopic Navigation and Laser Ablation Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible liquid crystal elastomer optical fibers achieve a physiological phase transition temperature (37.6&#160;&#176;C) with a waveguide structure, enabling low&#8208;loss light transmission (0.76 dB&#160;cm&#8722;1) and large photothermal actuation (30% contraction) under safe laser power. Integrated endoscopically in vivo, they facilitate controlled navigation, hemorrhage detection, and tumor ablation without thermal damage, offering a mechanically compliant platform for interventions in confined anatomical spaces.








Abstract
Photothermal&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) face critical barriers in biomedical applications: phase transition temperatures exceeding&#160;80&#160;&#176;C risk thermal injury, and free&#8208;space optical actuation fails in confined spaces. Here, a thiol&#8208;ene crosslinked LCE is developed with a biocompatible phase transition temperature (37.6&#160;&#176;C), enabling safe actuation within biological tissues. Through coaxial extrusion, the fabrication of waveguide&#8208;structured LCE optical fibers is pioneered, achieving ultralow optical loss (0.76 dB&#160;cm&#8722;1) and enabling long&#8208;range light transmission and remote actuation via silica optical fiber coupling. Under 808 nm laser stimulation (375 mW), these LCE optical fibers generate 30% contraction strain in 23 s, maintaining maximum surface temperature &lt; 48&#160;&#176;C. Integrated into an endoscopic system, LCE optical fibers replaced rigid mechanical components. Ex vivo characterization reveals their omnidirectional bending capability (94&#176; angular range), while in vivo trials on live rats and rabbits validate their operational functionality in anatomical environments, enabling hemorrhage detection and laser&#8208;steered tumor ablation via controlled navigation. Histopathological analysis confirms no thermal damage at fiber&#8208;tissue interfaces. This work establishes biocompatible LCE optical fibers as a photonic platform integrating photonic&#8208;driven soft actuation and tissue&#8208;compliant adaptability, enabling mechanically safe interventions in confined anatomical environments.

         <title>Highly Efficient Narrow&#8208;Emitting Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with an Intramolecular Sensitization Mechanism by Through&#8208;Space Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>

Highly efficient and narrow&#8208;emitting solution&#8208;processed circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes are developed using a novel multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter operated by an intramolecular thermally activated delayed fluorescence sensitized fluorescence emission mechanism.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable circularly polarized (CP) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are unique devices generating CP electroluminescence. However, the efficiency of solution&#8208;processed CP OLEDs is still low compared with vacuum&#8208;processed CP OLEDs. In this work, highly efficient and narrow&#8208;emitting solution&#8208;processed CP OLEDs are developed using a novel multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitter operated by an intramolecular TADF sensitized MR&#8208;TADF emission mechanism. The CP&#8208;type MR&#8208;TADF emitter is designed to have a TADF antenna unit and a terminal MR&#8208;TADF unit connected through a planar chiral unit. The TADF antenna unit plays the role of initial exciton generator, harvesting both singlet and triplet excitons, and the exciton energy is transferred to the terminal MR&#8208;TADF unitby through&#8208;space energy transfer. As a result, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the chiral MR&#8208;TADF emitter is significantly enhanced from 16.2% of the MR&#8208;TADF emitter without the TADF antenna unit to 28.0% by solution process. The CP OLEDs showed an electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of 10&#8722;3 order, demonstrating that the molecular design is also effective to achieve highly efficient CP emission in OLED. This work establishes an effective strategy for realizing highly efficient narrowband CP electroluminescence via intramolecular TADF&#8208;sensitized MR emission.

         <title>Molecular Association Chemistry Enables High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study proposes a universal molecular association chemistry to endow electrolyte solvents with synergistically medium polarity, high LUMO, and low HOMO by dipole&#8208;dipole and weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which facilitates superior high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging performance in Li batteries (68.4% capacity retention at 10C under 4.7&#160;V) via promoting the formation of electrolyte ion aggregate solvation structures.








Abstract
The ideal electrolyte for high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging lithium batteries (VFC&#8208;LBs) should solve two couples of paradoxes: low solvation barriers and high ionic conductivity, high oxidative and reductive stability. A single solvent&#8208;based electrolyte is very challenging to meet this demand because of its strong correlation between energy level and polarity. Here, the study develops a strategy of molecular association chemistry to endow electrolyte solvent with moderate polarity and wide energy level that are key to VFC&#8208;LBs. A descriptor of molecular association energy contributed from non&#8208;bonding interactions is proposed to directionally screen out VFC solvents. In an optimal fluorinated ethylene carbonate&#8208;ethyl acetate electrolyte, the 4.7&#160;V Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811, 2.2&#8201;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) coin cells maintain 68.4% of initial capacity at 10&#8201;C (1&#8201;C&#8201; = &#8201;220&#8201;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). And 400 mAh Li||NCM811 pouch cells (50&#160;&#181;m Li, 4.4&#8201;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 NCM811) exhibit stable cycling at 2.8&#8211;4.7&#160;V over 130 cycles. Molecular association chemistry reinforces VFC capability through inducing aggregate solvation structure and suppressing NiO phase formation. Notably, this molecular association strategy can also be readily extended to silicon@carbon||NCM811 and graphite||LiFePO4 batteries.

         <title>A Bioinspired Force&#8208;Inducible Hydrogel Conduit for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes serious health problems for patients. A bioinspired force&#8208;inducible nerve conduit can self&#8208;generate enhanced capillary forces without external stimuli to promote directed axon growth and delivery of Schwann cells toward the nerve distal ends, paralleling the repairing efficacy of autografts in long&#8208;gap PNI. This innovative approach enhances the potential for clinical implementation in long&#8208;gap PNI therapies.








Abstract
Long&#8208;gap peripheral nerve injury (PNI) presents a significant challenge since the growth cone at the proximal end fails to detect and respond to neurotrophic signals from the distal ends, even when bridging the long&#8208;gap with nerve guide conduits (NGCs), impeding the motivated growth of new axons. In this study, a bioinspired force&#8208;inducible multichannel nerve guide conduit (FI&#8208;MNGC) is developed, constructed from silk fibrin&#8208;based hydrogel. By mimicking the gradient capillary architectures in vascular plants, the FI&#8208;MNGC utilizes a multichannel design with gradient apertures that can self&#8208;generate enhanced capillary forces, which not only promote directed axon growth but also guide the directed delivery of Schwann cells (SCs) toward the distal ends of the injured nerve, without the need for any external stimuli. Implemented in a rat model with a 16&#160;mm and a rabbit model with a 30&#160;mm long&#8208;gap sciatic nerve defect, the FI&#8208;MNGC significantly accelerates the recovery process, paralleling the efficacy of autografts in nerve regeneration, functional recovery, and repair speed. This innovative approach offers a promising alternative to autografts, enhancing the potential for clinical implementation in long&#8208;gap PNI therapies.

&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) causes serious health problems for patients. A bioinspired force-inducible nerve conduit can self-generate enhanced capillary forces without external stimuli to promote directed axon growth and delivery of Schwann cells toward the nerve distal ends, paralleling the repairing efficacy of autografts in long-gap PNI. This innovative approach enhances the potential for clinical implementation in long-gap PNI therapies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-gap peripheral nerve injury (PNI) presents a significant challenge since the growth cone at the proximal end fails to detect and respond to neurotrophic signals from the distal ends, even when bridging the long-gap with nerve guide conduits (NGCs), impeding the motivated growth of new axons. In this study, a bioinspired force-inducible multichannel nerve guide conduit (FI-MNGC) is developed, constructed from silk fibrin-based hydrogel. By mimicking the gradient capillary architectures in vascular plants, the FI-MNGC utilizes a multichannel design with gradient apertures that can self-generate enhanced capillary forces, which not only promote directed axon growth but also guide the directed delivery of Schwann cells (SCs) toward the distal ends of the injured nerve, without the need for any external stimuli. Implemented in a rat model with a 16&#160;mm and a rabbit model with a 30&#160;mm long-gap sciatic nerve defect, the FI-MNGC significantly accelerates the recovery process, paralleling the efficacy of autografts in nerve regeneration, functional recovery, and repair speed. This innovative approach offers a promising alternative to autografts, enhancing the potential for clinical implementation in long-gap PNI therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Senescence Reprogramming Unleashes Tumor Immune Surveillance via Coordinated Gene Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle (TEPP) is developed to reprogram tumor&#8208;specific senescence by coordinating P16INK4a overexpression with PD&#8208;L1 knockdown. Through the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)&#160;targeting and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter&#8208;driven expression, TEPP selectively induces senescence in tumor cells, enhances senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP)&#8208;mediated immune activation, and alleviates immunosuppression. In combination with &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 checkpoint blockade, TEPP elicits robust anti&#8208;tumor immune responses across multiple tumor models.








Abstract
Cellular senescence can recruit immune cells for tumor therapy through the senescence&#8208;associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by immune tolerance and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence through coordinated modulation of P16INK4a and PD&#8208;L1 enhances tumor immunogenicity and alleviates immunosuppression. To achieve this, a target&#8208;enhanced gene delivery nanoparticle is engineered using the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) as a senescence&#8208;specific targeting ligand, combined with a telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter and a nuclear localization signal&#8208;microtubule&#8208;associated sequence (NLS&#8208;MTAS) peptide. This system efficiently induces tumor&#8208;specific senescence through cell&#8208;cycle arrest and promotes the chemotactic recruitment of cytotoxic immune cells. In vivo, the nanoparticle induces a robust anti&#8208;tumor response without causing systemic toxicity and significantly enhances the therapeutic efficacy of &#945;CTLA&#8208;4 immune checkpoint blockade in subcutaneous, lung metastasis, postoperative recurrence, and spontaneous tumor models. This study emphasizes the therapeutic potential of reprogramming tumor&#8208;specific senescence to improve targeted gene delivery and immunotherapy outcomes, offering a viable approach for the treatment of immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors.

         <title>Ultralight and Ablation&#8208;Resistant Shape&#8208;Memory Ceramizable Polymer Aerogel for Self&#8208;Adaptive Thermal Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;memory ceramizable polymer aerogel is developed that sequentially activates shape recovery and in situ ceramization under increasing temperatures, thereby combining aerodynamic deceleration with high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation.








Abstract
Deployable thermal protection systems (DTPS) for deep&#8208;space exploration require materials that integrate lightweight design, high deformability, and extreme temperature resistance. However, existing shape memory polymers (SMPs) suffer from limited thermal stability, while shape memory ceramics (SMCs) lack rapid programmability and efficient deployment capability. To overcome these limitations, a shape&#8208;memory ceramizable polymer aerogel (SMCPA) is developed capable of sequential self&#8208;adaptive thermo&#8208;responsive behavior, enabling the integration of structural deployment and thermal protection within a single material system. Upon exposure to high temperatures, SMCPA first undergoes rapid shape recovery to increase the projected area, followed by in situ ceramization at elevated temperatures to form a continuous ablation&#8208;resistant ceramic layer. The resultant SMCPA combines ultralow density (0.12 &#177; 0.02&#160;g cm&#8722;3), outstanding shape&#8208;memory performance (shape fixation ratio of 97.0 &#177; 0.5% and shape recovery ratio of 94.2 &#177; 0.6%), with remarkable ablation resistance (mass ablation rate of 0.012 &#177; 0.003&#160;g s&#8722;1 under 1.5 MW m&#8722;2 heat flux), outperforming conventional SMPs and SMCs in its ability to simultaneously provide programmable shape change and high&#8208;temperature stability. This study demonstrates that SMCPA successfully reconciles the conflict between lightweight deployable structures and high&#8208;temperature thermal protection, offering a promising material solution for next&#8208;generation DTPS in deep&#8208;space missions.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Polymer Electrolyte with Liquid Single&#8208;Atoms for Fast&#8208;Charging Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic liquid single&#8208;atoms introduce high disorder into the polymer chain segments, elevating the entropy of polymer the system and enabling entropy&#8208;driven fast ion transport. Simultaneously, the liquid metal atoms exhibit voltage&#8208;responsive stress behavior, which enhances the mechanical strength of polymer. This combination breaks the traditional view that polymer disorder and mechanical strength are mutually exclusive.








Abstract
The rate of interfacial transport and bulk transport of Na+ are determining steps that restrict fast&#8208;charging in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). Owing to the high interfacial compatibility, SPEs can reduce the interfacial impedance associated with ionic conduction. Despite the ability of high interfacial compatibility in the SPEs to promote the interfacial ion transfer, there remains no known material capable of concurrently boosting bulk&#8208;phase ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Specifically, the study reports an entropy&#8208;driven strategy based on dynamic liquid single atoms that rapidly rearranges polymer chains into entropy&#8208;increased regions, accelerating polymer complexation and dissociation to facilitate ion transport for fast&#8208;charging. Meanwhile, dynamic stress regulation by liquid atoms enhances the mechanical strength of the electrolyte. An independently designed stress&#8208;monitoring electrolytic cell is employed to perform in situ monitoring of the stress&#8208;voltage relationship. The novel SPE exhibits the capacity of 85.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 C, and the capacity retention of 91.76% after 1000 cycles at 10 C. Cell has the capability of 5&#8208;minute fast&#8208;charging with 19.8&#160;&#181;m thickness for the full&#8208;capacity at 10 C. Ah&#8208;level engineering application cells have the retention of 93.69% after 600 cycles at 1 C. Electrolytes incorporating liquid single&#8208;atoms offer new strategies for fast charging.

         <title>A New Strategy for&#160;Controlled&#160;In Situ Release of IL&#8208;2 from Tumor Spheroids Using a NIR&#8208;II Light&#8208;Mediated Optogenetic Manipulation System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic system using photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles is developed for controlled in situ interleukin &#8208; 2 (IL&#8208;2) release from 3D tumor spheroids. This approach enhances IL&#8208;2 secretion and activates NK&#8208;92 cells via specific IL&#8208;2RA upregulation, triggering JAK&#8208;STAT, PI3K&#8208;Akt, and MAPK signaling to improve immunotherapy within a biomimetic tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) is a clinically significant immunotherapeutic agent; its short half&#8208;life and poor targeting specificity in vivo have made controlled in situ release an important area of investigation. However, traditional 2D cell experiments and animal studies cannot fully replicate the real environment of human tumors and are limited by interspecies heterogeneity. Here, a NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic manipulation system based on photothermal conjugated polymer nanoparticles is successfully constructed, enabling the controlled in situ release of IL&#8208;2 from 3D tumor spheroids. Maintaining tumor spheroids at a relatively low temperature (&#8776;40&#160;&#176;C) can enhance IL&#8208;2 release by up to 4.3 times upon irradiation with 1080&#160;nm laser for 30 min. The released IL&#8208;2 further activates peripheral NK&#8208;92 cells, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, the in situ release of IL&#8208;2 specifically upregulates the expression of IL&#8208;2RA on NK&#8208;92 cells, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;affinity complexes between IL&#8208;2 and IL&#8208;2RA. This process activates multiple signaling pathways, including JAK&#8208;STAT, PI3K&#8208;Akt, and MAPK, for improved immunotherapy. Therefore, this NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;mediated optogenetic system provides a promising method for the controlled in situ release of important cytokines in the 3D tumor immune microenvironment for immunotherapy.

The released IL-2 further activates peripheral NK-92 cells, enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy. Additionally, the in situ release of IL-2 specifically upregulates the expression of IL-2RA on NK-92 cells, facilitating the formation of high-affinity complexes between IL-2 and IL-2RA. This process activates multiple signaling pathways, including JAK-STAT, PI3K-Akt, and MAPK, for improved immunotherapy. Therefore, this NIR-II light-mediated optogenetic system provides a promising method for the controlled in situ release of important cytokines in the 3D tumor immune microenvironment for immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Bonding Engineering Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Electrochromic Energy Storage in Flexible PEDOT Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deuterium&#8208;engineered PEDOT (PEDOT&#8208;D) is synthesized via isotopic substitution and Lewis acid&#8208;assisted polymerization. Strong C&#9472;D bonds damp backbone vibrations, yielding films with a &lt;5% capacitance loss after 300&#160;000 cycles. Flexible PEDOT&#8208;D&#8208;based electrochromic&#8208;supercapacitors present operational stability over 10&#160;000 cycles and from &#8722;25 to 50&#160;&#176;C with real&#8208;time visual state&#8208;of&#8208;charge feedback.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require materials that can withstand mechanical deformation while retaining electrochemical and optoelectronic functionality. Conducting polymers (CPs) are attractive candidates due to their inherent flexibility and electronic conductivity. However, their practical application is often limited by poor long&#8208;term stability and deteriorated performance, particularly under thermal or mechanical stress, owing to structural degradation and overoxidation at high potentials. Herein, a dual&#8208;strategy molecular design is adopted to intrinsically stabilize poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) by combining deuterium substitution with Lewis acid&#8208;assisted polymerization, which suppresses backbone vibrational energy and mitigates over&#8208;oxidative degradation during redox cycling. The resulting deuterated PEDOT film demonstrates exceptional multifunctional performance, including &lt;5% capacitance loss after 300&#160;000 cycles, a high electrochromic contrast of 40.9% at 700&#160;nm, and a specific capacitance of 317&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. PEDOT&#8208;D&#8208;based wearable electrochromic&#8208;supercapacitor devices subsequently exhibit 14.3% transmittance at 550&#160;nm, a specific capacitance of 39.7&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, robust stability, and reliable operation from &#8722;25 to 50&#160;&#176;C. This work establishes a structurally grounded molecular strategy for advancing the durability of CPs, providing a rational design for next&#8208;generation flexible energy systems that are mechanically robust, thermally adaptive, and optically responsive.

         <title>P&#8208;Block Compounds Incorporated into SEI Enable Ultra&#8208;Stable Cell Cycling in Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemically activated NiTe2@NC forms a p&#8208;block matrix as a functionalized sodium metal anode host. In&#8208;situ generated sodiophilic Na2Te and conductive Ni reduce the Na nucleation barrier and establish a bi&#8208;continuous ion/electron network, enabling uniform deposition. Concurrently, Na2Te facilitates formation of a robust, ion&#8208;conductive inorganic&#8208;rich SEI, homogenizing Na&#8314; flux to suppress dendrites.








Abstract
Sodium metal anodes (SMAs) are pivotal for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries but suffer from uncontrolled dendrite growth and interfacial instability caused by infinite volume expansion and a fragile solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed, in which a p&#8208;block matrix is in&#8208;situ formed from NiTe2 nanocrystals onto N&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspheres (NiTe2@NC) during electrochemical activation to overcome these challenges. The p&#8208;block matrix with sodiophilic Na2Te and conductive metallic nickel effectively reduces the nucleation barrier and establishes bi&#8208;continuous ion/electron conduction networks, guiding uniform Na plating. Critically, Na2Te dominates the formation of a gradient inorganic&#8208;rich SEI with high Young's modulus and low Na&#8314; diffusion barrier, significantly enhancing mechanical resilience and ion transport kinetics. Consequently, the NiTe2@NC electrode achieves exceptional cyclability (1,000 cycles at 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.79%). When configured in full&#8208;cells with a Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7 cathode, it maintains the capacity retention of over 96.1% (103.9 mAh g&#8722;1) after 1,200 cycles at 10.0 C. Critically, the full&#8208;cell maintains superior electrochemical resilience with high discharge&#8208;capacity and &gt;90% retention at low&#8208;temperatures (&#8722;20 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C), demonstrating exceptional practicality for sodium metal batteries. This work establishes a new paradigm for stabilizing reactive metal anodes via in&#8208;situ&#8208;constructed multifunctional interfaces.

         <title>Decoding Molten Salt&#8208;Mediated Crystallization Achieves Controllable Transformation of Heptazine&#8594;Triazine for Efficient Homojunction Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the mechanism of structure and morphology transformation of PHI in molten salt synthesis. By controlling the solidification state of the salt template, the well&#8208;defined homojunction composed of PHI nanorods and PTI hexagonal prisms is synthesized. After decorating with unsaturated Ni&#8211;N2 sites, the Z&#8208;scheme homojunction exhibits superior photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.








Abstract
Molten salt synthesis offers a versatile platform for catalyst fabrication, however, the mechanistic understanding of crystallization within molten salt system remains limited, hindering the rational tailoring of composition and morphology of the catalysts. Here, the intrinsic mechanism of molten salt&#8208;mediated crystal growth is revealed, which is exemplified by the growth of poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) and poly(triazine imide) (PTI). It is demonstrated that the solidification state of the salt template determines the structural and morphological transformation. By controlling the cooling program, the synthesis of PHI/PTI homojunctions with controllable components and morphologies is realized. Furthermore, the well&#8208;defined homojunction composed of PHI nanorods and PTI hexagonal prisms is obtained, with unsaturated Ni&#8722;N2 sites selectively anchored on PHI via ion exchange. The resulting Ni&#8208;decorated homojunction follows a Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism, which significantly promotes charge separation and maximizes the redox ability. When applied to photocatalytic CO2 reduction, the homojunction catalyst reaches a CO production rate of 121 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, which is 3.6 and 7.6 times those of pure PHI and PTI, respectively. This work deepens the understanding of molten salt&#8208;mediated crystallization and demonstrates a viable pathway for fabrication of high&#8208;performance catalysts through crystallization manipulation.

         <title>A Universal Laser&#8208;Driven Controllable Synthesis Methodology Enabling Electromagnetic Absorption in High&#8208;Entropy Rare&#8208;Earth Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromagnetic absorption functionality is successfully enabled in a series of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth oxides using a laser&#8208;driven controllable synthesis technique. The profoundly broadened effective absorption bandwidth, from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz, in a prototype 20&#8208;cation G&#8208;type high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth disilicate is attributed to the laser&#8208;induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies and the intensified local chemical order resulting from extreme element mixing.








Abstract
Imparting electromagnetic absorption functionality is key to realizing integrated structural and functional applications of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth oxides (HEREOs). Here, a laser&#8208;driven controllable synthesis (LDCS) technique is reported to achieve this long&#8208;desired goal. Specifically, utilizing this approach, all polymorphs of high&#8208;entropy rare&#8208;earth disilicates (HEREDs), including unreported &#948;&#8208;, F&#8208;, and G&#8208;type phases with up to 20 principal elements are successfully synthesized.

&lt;p&gt;Electromagnetic absorption functionality is successfully enabled in a series of high-entropy rare-earth oxides using a laser-driven controllable synthesis technique. The profoundly broadened effective absorption bandwidth, from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz, in a prototype 20-cation G-type high-entropy rare-earth disilicate is attributed to the laser-induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies and the intensified local chemical order resulting from extreme element mixing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imparting electromagnetic absorption functionality is key to realizing integrated structural and functional applications of high-entropy rare-earth oxides (HEREOs). Here, a laser-driven controllable synthesis (LDCS) technique is reported to achieve this long-desired goal. Specifically, utilizing this approach, all polymorphs of high-entropy rare-earth disilicates (HEREDs), including unreported &#948;-, F-, and G-type phases with up to 20 principal elements are successfully synthesized. Crucially, it is demonstrated that a G-type 20-cation HERED is conferred with exceptional electromagnetic wave absorption: an effective absorption bandwidth profoundly broadened from 0.01 to 5.26 GHz. This enhancement is attributed to a laser-induced generation of extensive oxygen vacancies, which markedly increases conductance in electrical insulating HEREOs, and an exacerbation of nanointerface polarization loss caused by intensified local chemical order inherent to the incorporation of 20 constituent elements. The universality of this LDCS technique in enabling electromagnetic wave absorption across diverse HEREO families, including monosilicates, hafnates, zirconates, tantalates, niobates, and aluminates is finally verified, making them promising as radar stealth and thermal/environmental barrier integrated coating materials for use in hot section components of aircraft engines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Promise of Solid Lubricants for a Sustainable Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lubricants are vital for technology, saving energy and resources. The industry seeks sustainable solutions beyond fossil fuels. Solid lubricants offer extremely low friction and reduce environmental impact, especially in harsh conditions. Can these solids truly replace liquid lubricants, or are they limited to extreme applications? Explore the status and prospects of solid lubricants for a greener future.








Abstract
There's no question that lubricants will become more crucial in a world where technology plays an ever&#8208;more&#8208;important role. Lubricants save vast amounts of energy and material resources by reducing friction and increasing the lifetime of devices. It is no surprise that the lubrication industry is one of the largest in the world. The climate crisis demands solutions independent of non&#8208;renewable fossil energy, from which most of the liquid lubricants are extracted. Solid lubricants are the focus of the research community because they provide extremely low friction with a potentially much lower environmental impact. They are used when the operating conditions of machines do not allow the use of liquids, such as in a high temperature or vacuum environment, or when contamination mitigation is critical. The future of solid lubricants is bright. Can they truly be a direct substitute for liquid lubricants in certain applications, as many researchers claim, or will they be used only for applications where operating conditions are too harsh? In this perspective, the status and prospects of several classes of solid lubricants for greener and more effective lubrication are critically reviewed, with the hope that they can help us achieve the sustainability goals for the planet.

         <title>Nanomedicine Reimagined: Translational Strategies for Precision Tumor Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 8, 6 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective review critically examines key challenges and emerging strategies for translating cancer nanomedicines into clinical practice. Integrating mechanistic insights, design principles, and regulatory considerations, it highlights biological, toxicological, and manufacturing barriers, while outlining innovative solutions, including multimodal imaging, AI&#8208;driven analytics, and human&#8208;relevant models, to advance precision nanotheranostics toward clinical impact.








Abstract
Nanomedicine has shown remarkable promise in advancing tumor imaging and therapy through its ability to achieve targeted delivery, precision imaging, and therapeutic efficacy. However, translating these preclinical successes into clinical practice remains fraught with challenges, including inconsistent tumor targeting, off&#8208;target organ accumulation, and a lack of comprehensive understanding of in vivo behavior of nanomedicines. In this perspective, the current state of nanomedicine research is critically analyzed, emphasizing the translational bottlenecks and offering a forward&#8208;looking view on potential solutions. The enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect are revisited, dissecting its variable relevance across small animals, large animals, and human patients. Emerging strategies are also discussed to overcome its limitations, such as active targeting and bioengineered delivery systems. Highlighting the need for multimodal imaging, it is proposed to combine nuclear imaging for deep&#8208;tissue penetration with high&#8208;resolution optical imaging to refine our understanding of nanomedicine biodistribution and tumor targeting. Additionally, nonspecific uptake in organs like the liver and spleen is examined, advocating for strategies such as carrier surface modification and biomimetic design to enhance tumor specificity. Moving forward, integrate advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;driven data analytics and humanized in vitro and in vivo models are proposed to better predict clinical outcomes. By critically synthesizing the current knowledge and proposing transformative directions, this review aims to inspire innovative approaches that will pave the way for nanomedicines to achieve their full clinical potential in tumor theranostics.

Super&#8208;Steep Subthreshold Swing
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202510618), Woojin Park, Yonghun Kim, Byungjin Cho, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV dec&#8722;1 in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppress the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.

         <title>Polymers for Biomedical Applications: the Quest for Treating Cardiovascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface modifications of stents can improve their endothelialization, which reduces the risk for thrombosis and restenosis. Biodegradability ensures no foreign body material remains over time, while shape memory expansion reduces damage to the arterial wall. Finally, advanced processing methods enable personalized treatments. The convergence of all these research fields could lead to improved stents for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of death worldwide. Current treatments using balloon angioplasty, stents, and bypass grafts still suffer from significant risks of restenosis and thrombosis. This review outlines key research areas where polymers are used in treatments for cardiovascular diseases, highlighting developments from the last decade. Designed to serve both experts and non&#8208;experts in the field, it requires little prior knowledge of the subject. A description of the cardiovascular system, cardiovascular diseases, current treatments, and their limitations are first introduced. After providing a detailed overview of the basic and advanced requirements for new treatments, recent advances in key research fields where polymers are applied to achieve these goals are highlighted. While surface modifications aim to improve endothelialization and/or prevent neointimal proliferation, shape memory polymer stents are intended to reduce damage to the arterial wall upon expansion. Research has also focused on developing biodegradable polymer stents to avoid any remaining material in the artery after healing. Finally, various advanced processing methods enable the production of polymeric personalized stents. By addressing various research areas in a single review, the interplay among them is highlighted, demonstrating that their convergence is essential for optimizing treatments and improving human quality of life.

Abstract
Thin&#8208;film batteries (TFBs) are vital for powering miniaturized electronics and Internet of Things(IoT) devices, offering compact size, long cycle life, and high safety. Utilizing solid&#8208;state electrolytes and thin&#8208;film deposition, TFBs integrate seamlessly with microelectronic systems. Advances in fabrication methods such as magnetron sputtering and atomic layer deposition, adapted from semiconductor manufacturing, have enhanced scalability, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical performance. Direct on&#8208;chip integration simplifies design and boosts energy efficiency, making TFBs key for next&#8208;generation electronics. Coupling TFBs with energy&#8208;harvesting technologies like solar cells or thermoelectrics enables self&#8208;sustaining systems. However, challenges remain, including low areal energy density and limits to further miniaturization. Progress in materials science, electrochemistry, and microfabrication is needed to overcome these barriers. This review summarizes recent TFB advances, classifying and analyzing materials, and detailing deposition processes and their refinements. It also addresses issues in processing, packaging, and operation, and describes analytical tools for evaluating structural and chemical stability. Finally, it highlights future application prospects and unresolved questions, providing a blueprint for ongoing research and guiding innovation toward wider adoption of TFB technology.

The rise of big data in today's computing has highlighted the significant limitations of von Neumann architectures for data storage and processing. Concurrently, the downscaling of silicon&#8208;based transistors while retaining low power efficiency and high system reliability has become increasingly challenging. By adopting a post&#8208;Moore approach, this Review proposes the use of hybrid systems comprising ferroelectric materials, 2D semiconductors, and functional molecular switches to respond to current demands for simultaneous high integration density and multifunctional performance. The representative applications of 2D ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) are reviewed and advances in shrinking ferroelectric domain walls at the (sub)nanometer scale are highlighted. The incorporation of molecular switches to enable multimodal device programmability is explored and the implementation of monolithic 3D (M3D) integration to boost chip&#8208;level density and system functionality is discussed. Finally, a forward&#8208;looking vision is presented for future transistors built upon novel ferroelectric platforms. Taken together, this triple&#8208;hybrid paradigm offers a compelling path to transcend Moore's law, paving the way for next&#8208;generation electronics with unprecedented functions and performance.

         <title>Facet&#8208;Engineered Rubidium Lead Halide Nanocrystals for Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyro&#8208;Phototronic effect in centrosymmetric 2D RbPb2Cl5 nanocrystals have been observed as a function of halide deficiency. These have lead heptrahedra and prepared following a template approach of cation exchange. Using ligand chemistry, different morphologies of these nanocrystals are synthesized and their pyro&#8208;phototronic response recorded from visible to near IR spectral region.








Abstract
Cesium lead halide has been extensively studied as efficient materials for optoelectronic device applications. Beyond Cs(I), the exploration of other inorganic A&#8208;site monovalent cations remains limited, though Rb(I) stands out as a potential alternative whose role in colloidal nanocrystals is largely unexplored. Here, Rb (I) is employed as an effective A&#8208;site cation in forming monoclinic&#8208;phase RbPb2Cl5, where Pb (II) heptahedrally coordinated. A template&#8208;mediated cation exchange strategy is employed where 0D Rb4CdCl6 used as host nanocrystals. Upon introduction of Pb (II), fast Cd to Pb ion exchange triggers and 2D RbPb2Cl5 in rhombic prism, hexagonal prism or hexagonal platelet&#8208;shaped nanocrystals are formed depending on the reaction conditions. Further to explore the optoelectronic properties, photo response measurements are carried out which exhibit significant pyro&#8208;photocurrent response from these nanocrystals even under ultra&#8208;low&#8208;intensity light illumination (7 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2) across ultraviolet (UV) to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Despite its centrosymmetric structure, RbPb2Cl5 generates pyro&#8208;photocurrent due to surface halide deficiencies, supported by DFT which shows surface polarization of |&#120665;P| = 0.173 C&#160;m&#8722;2. These findings highlight the pivotal role of Rb (I) in stabilizing these nanostructures and open a new avenue for their application in advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Promoting Active Hydrogen Supply and Nitrate Adsorption by Disordering Tetrahedral&#8208;Octahedral Structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; for Efficient Nitrate Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) by Co doping promotes water dissociation for hydrogen supply and formation of oxygen vacancy for hydrogen storage, enabling high&#8208;efficiency deoxygenation and hydrogeneration of nitrate reduction to ammonia.








Abstract
Modulating the local coordination environment can optimize the electronic structure and reaction pathway of nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3RR), beneficial to enhance the catalytic activity and selectivity. Herein, a disordered tetrahedral&#8208;octahedral structure of CuAl2O4&#8208;&#948; (CAO) is proposed by Co doping as an efficient catalyst. Theoretical calculations reveal Co doping induces strong Co&#8208;Al orbital interactions at octahedral sites, which lowers the energy barrier for water dissociation, and meanwhile, Oxygen vacancies (Vos) induced by Co doping not only enhance NO3&#8722; adsorption, but also serve as reservoir sites for transient *H storage, thereby promoting hydrogenation steps. The synergistic Cu&#8208;Vo interaction facilitates the conversion of *NO3&#8211; to *NO2&#8211; and the interfacial electron transfer between Co and Cu suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The substitution of 30% Co in CAO (Co&#8208;3) nanofibers creates the most Vos, resulting in a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.00% and a substantial NH3 yield rate of 27.86 mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1cat. in neutral media. Additionally, it exhibits exceptional long&#8208;term electrochemical durability and chemical stability. Thermodynamic analysis unveils the potential&#8208;determining step of *NO2 to *NO for Co&#8208;3 possesses a low free energy of only 0.05 eV, highly superior to 0.29 eV for the pristine CAO.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Actuated Hot&#8208;Carrier/Polarization Triggers Catalysis to Coordinate Staphylococcus aureus Ribosome Stalling and Treat Deep&#8208;Seated Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

Medical microwave actuation of Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type tandem reactors generates hot&#8208;carrier and quick&#8208;change polarization, respectively, by triggering the temperature, while synergizing with microwave&#8208;induced bacterial ribosome stalling to efficiently eliminate deep&#8208;seated bacterial infections.








Abstract
Due to the low energy of microwaves (MW), MW dynamic therapy (MWDT) remains inefficient in treating deep&#8208;seated infections. Here, an MW&#8208;actuated hot&#8208;carrier/polarization&#8208;triggers catalysis strategy is proposed via two types of tandem reactors to amplify the efficacy of MWDT. By combining MW&#8208;thermosensitive carbon nanotube (CNT) with thermal&#8208;electricity conversion materials, the Seebeck&#8208;type and pyroelectric&#8208;type MW&#8208;thermal&#8208;electricity tandem reactors (CNT&#8208;Bi2Te3 and CNT&#8208;ZnO) are prepared. The CNT converts MW into a local heat source and rapidly heats Bi2Te3 or ZnO to activate hot&#8208;carrier or polarization for high&#8208;yield reactive oxygen species production to treat deep&#8208;seated infections. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal MW stalls the ribosomes of Staphylococcus aureus, thereby hindering its proliferation. Therefore, the biocompatible tandem reactor synergizes with bacterial ribosome stalling to demonstrate a targeted bactericidal effect in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a series of antimicrobial products is developed for precise and efficient antimicrobial therapies.

&lt;p&gt;Due to the low energy of microwaves (MW), MW dynamic therapy (MWDT) remains inefficient in treating deep-seated infections. Here, an MW-actuated hot-carrier/polarization-triggers catalysis strategy is proposed via two types of tandem reactors to amplify the efficacy of MWDT. By combining MW-thermosensitive carbon nanotube (CNT) with thermal-electricity conversion materials, the Seebeck-type and pyroelectric-type MW-thermal-electricity tandem reactors (CNT-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CNT-ZnO) are prepared. The CNT converts MW into a local heat source and rapidly heats Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ZnO to activate hot-carrier or polarization for high-yield reactive oxygen species production to treat deep-seated infections. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal MW stalls the ribosomes of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, thereby hindering its proliferation. Therefore, the biocompatible tandem reactor synergizes with bacterial ribosome stalling to demonstrate a targeted bactericidal effect in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, a series of antimicrobial products is developed for precise and efficient antimicrobial therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>LDI, A Lipid Droplet Inhibitor, Disrupts Lipid Accumulation and Modulates Hepatic Lipid Profiles in Fatty Liver</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI), templated with large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica and functionalized with PKC&#945; C1A and lipase, targets lipid degradation in fatty liver. The LDI maintains stable association with lipid droplets, thereby suppressing their formation and expansion. It significantly alleviates liver abnormalities in vivo and effectively regulates hepatic lipid metabolism.









Abstract
Excessive lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes drives the progression of metabolic dysfunction&#8208;associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), often leading to inflammation and fibrosis. As obesity and metabolic syndrome rise, MASLD has become a global concern, spurring research into effective treatments. Here, the design of a Lipid droplet inhibitor (LDI) is presented, incorporating porous silica nanostructures along with PKC&#945; C1A and Candida Rugosa lipase, aimed at directly degrading lipid droplets. Through its dual&#8208;functional design, this nanostructure captures diacylglycerol using PKC&#945; C1A while hydrolyzing triacylglycerol into smaller molecular fragments via the lipase. Notably, the amphiphilic biomolecules in LDI facilitate the formation of a Pickering emulsion, ensuring stable localization at the lipid&#8208;water interface for efficient interaction with lipid droplets. LDI reduces lipid droplet formation and triglyceride levels in palmitic acid&#8208;treated HepG2 cells. In a high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;induced MASLD model, it alleviateds liver pathology and, lowered injury scores by up to 84%. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis confirmed that LDI effectively modulated the hepatic lipid profile, suggesting its potential as a nanoplatform for counteracting lipid droplet accumulation.

         <title>Implanting Metal&#8208;Oxo Single Sites on Metal Surface: A Path to Geometric and Electronic Synergy in Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedding isolated metal&#8211;oxo sites onto a metallic surface enables synergistic covalent hybridization and geometric regulation, thereby optimizing the adsorption strength of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Promising and diverse strategies have emerged for creating isolated catalytic active sites, such as single&#8208;atom catalysts and single&#8208;atom alloys, aiming at achieving efficient and selective catalysis. However, the structural tunability of isolated active sites has largely been restricted to their chemical compositions, primarily due to the absence of a higher&#8208;order structure associated with these isolated atoms. To address this, an additional degree of freedom is introduced by incorporating functional groups onto these active sites. Specifically, metal&#8208;oxo single sites are implanted onto metal surfaces to achieve geometric and electronic synergy. As a demonstration of this concept, bismuth single sites are embedded onto a palladium surface, promoting p&#8208;d orbital hybridization and facilitating the formation of terminal Bi&#8208;oxo species. This cooperative interaction optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates through both covalent electronic hybridization and geometric interactions. The Bi&#8208;oxo&#8208;embedded Pd hybrid nanostructure, created through consecutive etching and displacement deposition, enables the simultaneous optimization of key intermediates for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction. Remarkably, this hybrid nanostructure achieves specific and mass activities 11.03 and 8.45 times greater than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Furthermore, it demonstrates high stability and achieves a power density of 280 mW cm&#8722;2 in direct methanol fuel cells.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;in&#8208;Liquid Prints: High&#8208;Density Biochemically Encoded Information Preserved in Microdroplet Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel approach for encoding and storing information in the liquid state in microdroplet arrays. These liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid prints are generated by a droplet printing system capable of dynamically setting the composition of each droplet pixel. Information in the form of color images, QR codes, text characters, words and basic programmes are biochemically written into micro&#8208;liquid patterns.








Abstract
Liquids are dense repositories of information, challenged only by how well their compositions are defined, preserved, accessed, or measured. The precise spatial patterning of solutes within a bulk liquid is challenging since diffusion disperses local concentrations and thereby attenuates functionality. Herein, a new concept is introduced for writing and preserving information in the liquid state through liquid&#8208;in&#8208;liquid microdroplet array printing. This technology produces fine resolution, 2D liquid structures, composite of indexed water&#8208;in&#8208;oil droplet pixels each with a precise composition, a high spatial resolution and a tight inter&#8208;pixel pitch. With extreme control over droplet composition and by applying standard and custom encoding schemes, various forms of information are written biochemically such as images, QR codes, text characters and words. As a composite material, reversible phase transitions between dissolved liquid and crystallized solid states control information encryption and decryption. Compared to current liquid printing and chemical encoding paradigms, ours introduces a fundamentally new precedent for deterministically programming information release, exchange or decay without stimuli or physical processing. Further computational principles such as error correction and information storage are demonstrated. These micro&#8208;liquid patterns are relevant to any application based on precise liquid handling such as information theory, materials design and biological assays.

         <dc:description>
An analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh, is developed to efficiently regulate molecular H&#8208;/J&#8208;aggregation, suppress exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforce intermolecular interaction, prolonging exciton lifetime and exciton diffusion length of the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh based ternary organic solar cells (OSCs) achieve the remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), among the highest values for OSCs so far.








Abstract
The limited exciton diffusion length (LD) of organic photovoltaic materials puts organic solar cells (OSCs) into a harsh position to compromise exciton diffusion and charge carrier transport, impeding the further improvement of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). The exciton behavior of organic semiconductors is strongly related to the molecular alignment. Herein, an analogue of L8&#8208;BO, L8&#8208;OPh with benzyl&#8208;alkyl inner side chains is developed to blend with L8&#8208;BO and successfully regulate its molecular alignment. Incorporating L8&#8208;OPh into L8&#8208;BO enhances the H&#8208;aggregation tendency, weakens exciton&#8208;vibration coupling, and enforces the intermolecular interaction of L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend films. Such endows the L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend film with improved exciton lifetime and larger exciton diffusion coefficient to prolong the LD up to 22.1&#160;nm, compared to L8&#8208;BO (16.5&#160;nm). Besides, L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh blend films acquire increased crystallinity and better crystal quality to afford lower trap density, prolonged charge carrier lifetime and higher mobilities in D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh ternary devices. Therefore, D18:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;OPh ternary OSCs achieve the remarkable PCE of 20.51% (certified as 20.43%), which is among the highest PCEs in OSCs so far. It highlights the importance of finely regulating molecular alignment of organic photovoltaic materials to prolong the LD and boost PCEs of OSCs.

         <title>Trace Chlorine&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Activation for Enhanced High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

Trace Cl&#8722; incorporation into Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8722;&#948; weakens metal&#8211;oxygen covalency to activate lattice oxygen, enhances CO2 adsorption, promotes bulk O2&#8722; transport, and accelerates CO2 reduction kinetics, collectively enabling a current density of 2.02 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.5 V with &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency and outstanding 500 h stability for high&#8208;temperature CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.








Abstract
Tuning lattice oxygen activity in perovskite oxides (ABO3) offers a promising approach to overcome the intrinsic trade&#8208;off between catalytic activity and stability in redox reactions. However, precise modulation and mechanistic understanding of lattice oxygen activation remain elusive under high&#8208;temperature CO2 electrolysis conditions. Herein, a novel anion activation strategy is proposed by incorporating trace chloride ions (Cl&#8722;) into the O&#8208;sites of Sr2Fe1.5Mo0.5O6&#8722;&#948; perovskite forming an oxychloride cathode. This Cl&#8722; substitution activates lattice oxygen reactivity by weakening Mo&#8722;O/Fe&#8722;O covalency, thereby facilitating the formation and redistribution of oxygen vacancies, accelerating bulk oxygen ion transport, enhancing CO2 adsorption and carbonate intermediate formation, and ultimately promoting CO2 reduction kinetics. As a result, the oxychloride cathode achieves a 60.2&#8211;80.8% enhancement in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis, reaching 2.02 A cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.5&#160;V with &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency, while maintaining exceptional stability of 500 h. This work establishes a new paradigm of O&#8208;site anion engineering to unlock lattice oxygen activity for electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Creep Adhesive Tapes via Trapped&#8208;Entanglement&#8208;Regulated Topological Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under continuous external force, creep deformation occurs on the adhesive joint insidiously, which will gradually result in failure. Authors introduce topological trapped entanglements to build a permanent yet compliant polymer network, effectively improving the long&#8208;term adhesion performance of adhesive tapes under static load condition.








Abstract
Adhesive tapes with high adhesion strength are critical in applications from structural bonding, biomedical devices, to flexible electronics. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by creep&#8212;time&#8208;dependent deformation under sustained stress&#8212;which leads to irreversible failure in long&#8208;term applications. While transient non&#8208;covalent interactions are widely engineered to enhance short&#8208;term energy dissipation, they inherently compromise creep resistance due to their dynamic reversibility. Herein, this persistent challenge is addressed by designing anti&#8208;creep adhesive tapes through precise topological regulation of polymer networks. By systematically comparing linear, covalent&#8208;crosslink, and trapped&#8208;entanglement&#8208;dominated architectures, the entanglement&#8208;stabilized networks are demonstrated to achieve a three&#8208;orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude reduction in creep rate while maintaining strong interfacial adhesion. The unique combination of long&#8208;chain entanglements and spare crosslinks enables efficient elastic energy storage without sacrificing tackiness, resolving the trade&#8208;off between dynamic dissipation and permanent mechanical integrity. This work provides both a mechanistic framework for understanding creep in adhesive materials and a scalable strategy for developing durable, high&#8208;performance polymer adhesives.

         <title>Optically Driven Eutectogel Pyroelectric for Efficient Deformable Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an elastomeric, self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a polyvinyl alcohol pyroelectric eutectogel, which achieves an ultrabroad spectral response, high responsivity and detectivity, as well as a fast response time. Its versatile applicability is demonstrated in encrypted optical communication, conformal image sensing, and diffuse reflection imaging.








Abstract
Ionic gels are emerging stimuli&#8208;response elastomers for biomimetic sensors in diverse fields. Photoresponse ionic gels can detect light as a photoreceptor to emulate biological vision for artificial retina and skin. However, the existing ionic gel&#8208;based photosensors face limited response speeds and detecting sensitivity due to inefficient ion transport. Here, a high&#8208;performance elastomeric photodetector made of polyvinyl alcohol&#8208;based pyroelectric eutectogels, containing polar ions and crystalline domains, is reported, which exhibits a high pyroelectric coefficient and enables efficient optical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion via spontaneous polarization, even under 30% tensile strain. The resulting self&#8208;powered photodetector features a broad spectral response spanning 365&#8211;1300&#160;nm, with photoresponsivity, detectivity, and response time of 42.06&#160;mA W&#8722;1, 7.65 &#215; 1010 Jones and 24/35&#160;ms at 455&#160;nm, respectively. The photodetector array enables light&#8208;encrypted communication and sensitive optical imaging.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Starting with an overview of the concepts, classifications, principles, and fabrication methods for nanopores, this review presents a comprehensive picture of the broad application scenarios for nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS), particularly for precision diagnosis. Additionally, it encourages researchers and readers to explore potential directions for enhancing nanopore&#8208;based SMS beyond typical applications by focusing on the intrinsic properties of nanopores.








Abstract
Nanopore&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule sequencing (SMS) is a powerful tool for acquiring detailed heterogeneous information on critical building blocks of life, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and a wide array of biomolecules, at the single&#8208;molecule level. Real&#8208;time current&#8208;intensity fluctuations corresponding to the passage of target molecules through nanopores enable long&#8208;read length, high&#8208;throughput, and high&#8208;accuracy detection, thus meeting the stringent demands of precision diagnosis. Herein, a concise overview of various principles and fabrication methods is provided for nanopores, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in nanopore&#8208;based DNA and protein sequencing, revealing innovative approaches for effectively capturing and translocating target molecules, and rapid and accurate identification. Further typical cases of nanopore&#8208;based SMS applications in precision diagnosis are analyzed, focusing on genetic disorders, infectious diseases, cancers, and abnormal post&#8208;translational modifications to highlight the clinical potential of nanopores. Additionally, the inherent limitations and challenges of nanopores in terms of sensitivity, detection range, and selectivity are discussed and present the latest strategies for enhancing nanopore performance. Finally, perspectives are provided on the future of nanopore&#8208;based SMS, particularly at the intersection of microfluidic devices, surface functionalization, and machine learning, to facilitate more diverse and advanced developments in this field.

         <title>Engineering of Stabilized Ru&#8208;Based Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing the stabilized Ru&#8208;based proton exchange membrane water electrolysis is a significant step for the low&#8208;cost production of green hydrogen. The stability degradation mechanism of the whole system, and the mutual effects of core components are systematically sorted out, with an emphasis on synergistic optimization strategies. Aiming to provide a guidance for the design of high&#8208;stable and low&#8208;cost Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is a promising blueprint for the industrial production of green hydrogen in the short term, but its large&#8208;scale deployment is extremely constrained by the high cost and low storage of Ir&#8208;dependent anode catalysts. Ru&#8208;based PEMWE, employing Ru&#8208;based composites as anode catalysts, has emerged as a promising alternative to Ir&#8208;dependent PEMWE in recent years, offering lower electrolytic voltages and improved cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the practical application of Ru&#8208;based PEMWE is hindered by stability degradation involving Ru&#8208;based catalyst dissolution, membrane chemical degradation, corrosion of porous transport layer and bipolar plate, and the interactions between them. In this review, the stability degradation mechanisms from Ru&#8208;based catalyst to other core components to the cell system alongside the mutual effects of core components are systematically sorted out. The stability synergistic optimization strategies are subsequently discussed, ranging from individual components to system&#8208;level comprehensive consideration, for the engineering of a stable Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system. Finally, the outlook is provided based on the promising development direction and key scientific challenge for Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system, aiming to provide theoretical guidance and technical reference for the design of highly stable and low&#8208;cost Ru&#8208;based PEMWE system by integrating industry&#8208;aligned standards and emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in system engineering.

         <title>Graphene Liquid Cells for In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy: Unveiling Nanomaterial Growth and Etching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how graphene liquid cells (GLCs) enable in situ transmission electron microscopy of nanomaterial growth and etching. It presents strategies for preparing suspended graphene, diverse routes for fabricating GLCs, and representative applications in monitoring dynamic nanoscale transformations. The discussion provides insights into opportunities and challenges of advancing GLC&#8208;based liquid&#8208;phase studies.








Abstract
The liquid&#8208;phase growth and etching process of nanomaterials profoundly affects their size, morphology, and composition, thereby determining their properties. Achieving real&#8208;time atomic&#8208;resolution visualization of these processes has driven the development of in situ liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy imaging. Especially, graphene liquid cells (GLCs) have emerged as a powerful platform due to their high resolution, facile fabrication, and compatibility with conventional transmission electron microscopy holders. This review first summarizes the preparation of suspended graphene, the key window material for GLCs, and the fabrication of GLCs with diverse configurations. It then systematically outlines the applications of GLCs in revealing the growth and etching processes of nanomaterials, and finally concludes with perspectives on the opportunities and challenges associated with GLC&#8208;based research. This review aims to provide a panoramic understanding and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of this rapidly evolving field.

         <title>The Space Within: How Architected Voids Promote Tissue Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the role of void spaces in tissue engineering scaffolds and examines four key methods for introducing porosity into hydrogels at different scales. It discusses sacrificial templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing, highlighting principles, advantages, and limitations. It also addresses emerging strategies integrating these techniques to better mimic physiological microenvironments in hierarchical structures and enhance scaffold functionality.








Abstract
Physiological void spaces exist at every scale of the human body, from organs to molecules, facilitating transport, signal propagation, and localized biochemical activity. Constriction of these spaces (e.g., arterial occlusion, fibrosis) highlights their importance, making their mimicry essential in tissue engineering (TE). This review examines four key strategies for introducing porosity into hydrogels across multiple length scales: templating, microgels, phase separation, and 3D printing. The first three methods enable the engineering of physiological environments at the nano&#8208; to micro&#8208;scale, mimicking tissue&#8208; and extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;level spaces. Templating involves embedding and removal of gas, liquid, or solid phases, leaving behind pores. Microgel annealing generates inherent interstitial voids. Liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) creates biphasic networks reminiscent of native ECM. The fourth approach, extrusion&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing techniques, enables the fabrication of larger&#8208;scale spaces, such as luminal structures (e.g., vasculature, airways, and ducts). Combining these methods enables the creation of hierarchical architectures from the nano&#8208; to centimeter scale. The review also highlights Filamented Light (FLight) technology, which creates internal microstructural voids relevant to anisotropic tissues. This review offers insights into current methods and their convergence for generating biomimetic void spaces to meet the physiological demands of cells, tissues, and organs.

         <title>Advanced Design and Characterization of Polyether&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyether solid electrolytes possess strong lithium&#8208;salt solvation ability and flexible interfacial contact, yet suffer from sluggish ion transport and poor interfacial stability in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density pouch cells. This review integrates multicomponent and structural tuning strategies, illustrates structure&#8211;property insights via multiscale characterizations, benchmarks pouch&#8208;cell performance, and outlines the scalability and consistency challenges facing commercialization.








Abstract
Polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes have shown great potential in lithium batteries due to their excellent interfacial flexibility and high solvation ability for lithium salts. However, the problems of limited ion transport and insufficient interfacial stability have restricted the application of polyether&#8208;based electrolytes in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#160;batteries. To tackle these problems, researchers have explored a variety of strategies, such as multi&#8208;component compounding and structural regulation, and developed a vast array of solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Therefore, this review first summarizes the key modification strategies and representative examples of electrolytes from a systematic design perspective, aiming at the two aforementioned major issues. Meanwhile, to precisely implement the above strategies and to design more effective modification strategies, latent yet valuable structure&#8211;property relationships should be further uncovered. Thus, multiscale characterizations are rationally integrated through representative case studies. Finally, it summarizes the reported performance of representative polyether&#8208;based solid&#8208;state pouch cells, emphasizes scale&#8208;up and batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch consistency, and outlines future research directions for translating these electrolytes into high&#8208;energy, market&#8208;ready batteries.

         <title>Breaking Dilution Limits: Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production from Low&#8208;Concentration Nitrate Streams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3). It covers reaction mechanisms, efficiency factors, and key challenges at low&#8208;concentration conditions. Performance improvement strategies are analyzed, alongside feasibility assessment for large&#8208;scale application through application scenarios, techno&#8208;economic, and life&#8208;cycle. Future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.








Abstract
The conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) in water to high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonia (NH3) using an electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (eNO3&#8722;RR) provides a viable technological pathway to address the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle. Unfortunately, most of the existing studies have focused on the ideal conditions of high&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722;, but most of the polluted waters around the world are usually at low&#8208;concentration levels. Consequently, researching eNO3&#8722;RR under low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; is more practical. Although the study of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; has gradually gained attention in recent years, a systematic review of the literature in this area has not yet been reported. To fill this research gap, this paper reviews recent advances in the electrocatalytic reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO3&#8722; to NH3.

     alt="Breaking Dilution Limits: Electrocatalytic Ammonia Production from Low-Concentration Nitrate Streams"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes the electrocatalytic reduction of low-concentration nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) to value-added ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). It covers reaction mechanisms, efficiency factors, and key challenges at low-concentration conditions. Performance improvement strategies are analyzed, alongside feasibility assessment for large-scale application through application scenarios, techno-economic, and life-cycle. Future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversion of nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) in water to high-value-added ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) using an electrocatalytic NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reduction reaction (eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR) provides a viable technological pathway to address the imbalance in the global nitrogen cycle. Unfortunately, most of the existing studies have focused on the ideal conditions of high-concentration NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, but most of the polluted waters around the world are usually at low-concentration levels. Consequently, researching eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR under low-concentration NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is more practical. Although the study of low-concentration NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; has gradually gained attention in recent years, a systematic review of the literature in this area has not yet been reported. To fill this research gap, this paper reviews recent advances in the electrocatalytic reduction of low-concentration NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Initially, the nature of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; as a reactant, the reaction mechanism of eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR, and the factors affecting the efficiency are introduced. Subsequently, the key challenges of electrocatalytic reduction of low-concentration NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; are analyzed, and various strategies to improve the performance of eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR are summarized on this basis. Additionally, the feasibility of large-scale ammonia recovery using eNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;RR under low-concentration NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; is assessed through application scenario exploration, economic analyses, and life cycle assessment. Ultimately, future research directions are outlined to inspire future work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Characterization of Complex Stacking of Semiconductors Through Near Field Imaging and Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of complex epitaxial heterostructures composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. Both the geometrical parameters of the stack and the optical properties of the individual layers and of the interfaces are retrieved, as well as the doping level of the heavily doped semiconductors.








Abstract
While high operating temperature infrared photodetection remains a major technological objective, huge improvements have been obtained through the use of increasingly complex semiconductors epitaxies such as quantum cascade structures or III&#8211;V superlattice junction. However, the characterization of these layers is challenging and often requires the use of destructive processes. Here, SNOM imaging and spectroscopy on a mechanically cleaved facet is used to characterize the different layers of a complex epitaxial heterostructure composed of a type II superlattice and highly doped semiconductors. These near&#8208;field experimental data are compared to simulation in order to retrieve both the cut&#8208;off frequency of the superlattice and the doping level of each highly doped semiconductor layers. Additionally, information about interfaces is optically retrieved through hyperspectral characterization of plasmons propagating at these vertical interfaces. In parallel, all the materials and exact stacking of the epitaxy are confirmed through scanning transmission electron&#160;microscopy.

         <title>Giga&#8208;Voxel Multiscale Composite Architecture Mirrored Through a Data&#8208;to&#8208;Model Closed&#8208;Loop Digital Twin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models is presented, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8211;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8211;up data&#8208;driven voxel generation.








Abstract
Giga&#8208;voxel digital models offer abundant geometric detail; however, no mainstream method currently exists to efficiently distribute individual voxels across massive image volumes, and designing complex anisotropic composite materials remains infeasible due to the absence of promising methods. Herein, we propose a systematic digital twin workflow tailored for generating high&#8208;fidelity virtual representations of anisotropic composite microstructures and giga&#8208;voxel meso&#8208;structural models, leveraging a harmonious integration of top&#8208;down image&#8208;based modeling and bottom&#8208;up data&#8208;driven generation. Our study demonstrates the efficacy of micro&#8208;digital representations as foundational building blocks within a continuum of digital assembly processes tailored for mesostructural models. Utilizing 3D image data, specifically X&#8208;ray tomography, our data&#8208;driven modeling meticulously characterizes the geometric attributes of the experimentally observed objects, thereby facilitating the creation of digital unit twins, each endowed with distinct identities assigned through a random seed generation. The closed&#8208;loop system provides feedback mechanism between data and model to ensure the 3D quality of the generated models. For hierarchical organization at the giga&#8208;voxel level, the digital unit twins are methodically expanded into cohesive 3D architectures based on assembly relationship at length scales of more than four orders of magnitude. Remarkably, this hierarchical model provides intricate insight into micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro geometrics while preserving the intrinsic microstructure.

         <title>Unveiling of Unpaired Surface Spins Regulated Magnetism in 2D &#945;&#8208;Te Nanosheets: an Implication on Magnetoelectric Driven Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium nanosheets unveil a novel form of magnetism regulated by their unpaired surface spins. This emergent property, coupled with ferroelectricity, generates a giant magnetoelectric response. When utilized as a catalyst, this effect significantly accelerates the hydrogen evolution reaction, drastically reducing the required overpotential and demonstrating impressive electrochemical stability for next&#8208;generation energy technologies.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D tellurium (Te) unlocks surface spins (of valence 5p4 electrons) of tunable ferromagnetic order and response to strain&#8208;engineered electronic properties of widespread applications. In spin&#8211;orbit coupling, the inversion symmetry is broken in a 1S0 &#8594; 3S1 spin&#8208;transition of the ground electronic state, a synergetic pathway to charge spin&#8208;order under applied driving forces. The surface magnetism, combined with the ferroelectricity, gives a giant magnetoelectric response (absent in 1S0 bulk Te state) that is explored to boost the H2 evolution reaction (HER) with 2D &#945;&#8208;Te as a synergetic catalyst. High&#8208;quality 2D &#945;&#8208;Te synthesized as nanosheets is ordered primarily along (001) facets at duly enhanced d001 atomic spacing in the 5s2&#8208;Te lone pair electrons (diamagnetic) are spaced (Coulomb repulsion) via the 5p2 unpaired spins. Poled 2D &#945;&#8208;Te in small fields, such as 30 mT, presents a HER overpotential that is decreased up to 100&#160;mV, while the Tafel slope is declined up to 138 from 211&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 for the bulk sample. The electrochemical stability of 2D &#945;&#8208;Te is found quite impressive with 93% current retention (71% if non&#8208;magnetized) under chronoamperometric conditions. The results present that the 2D &#945;&#8208;Te plays a game&#8208;changing role towards sustainable energy technologies, spintronics, and next&#8208;generation magnetoelectric devices.

         <title>MXene Membrane as Multifunctional Interface for Vapor Splitting via Photothermal&#8208;Catalytic Membrane Distillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional MXene&#8208;based membrane integrates photothermal evaporation and photocatalytic vapor splitting in a sweeping&#8208;gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) platform, simultaneously generating freshwater and hydrogen. The SrTiO3/MX@PVDF interface leverages broad&#8208;spectrum solar absorption, efficient heat/mass transfer, and gas&#8211;solid catalysis to achieve high flux, robust H2 production, and long&#8208;term stability, highlighting a sustainable water&#8211;energy solution.








Abstract
Advancements in solar&#8208;driven processes are fundamentally transforming the production of freshwater and energy into a more sustainable manner. Realizing such potential requires developing highly efficient solar responsive materials and advanced solar systems. Here, an MXene&#8208;based membrane is reported as a multifunctional interface capable of simultaneously producing freshwater and hydrogen through a strategically designed photothermal&#8208;catalytic sweeping gas membrane distillation (PTC&#8208;SGMD) system. By leveraging membrane interface engineering, the innovative design integrates solar evaporation, vapor transportation, and vapor splitting within a single membrane. Unlike conventional liquid&#8211;solid systems, this liquid&#8211;solid&#8211;gas configuration overcomes photocatalyst leaching, interfacial heat loss, and inefficient mass transfer. The multifunctional membrane exhibits enhanced solar absorption and optimal permeability, enabling the MXene&#8208;photocatalyst composite to achieve efficient photocatalytic vapor splitting. Remarkably, the optimized SrTiO3/MX@PVDF membrane achieves a simultaneous water flux of 2.37&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 and hydrogen production of 947.8&#160;&#181;mol m&#8722;2h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation. The PTC&#8208;SGMD system demonstrates total solar efficiency of 92.305% with outstanding stability over 72 h of continuous operation.

     alt="MXene Membrane as Multifunctional Interface for Vapor Splitting via Photothermal-Catalytic Membrane Distillation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multifunctional MXene-based membrane integrates photothermal evaporation and photocatalytic vapor splitting in a sweeping-gas membrane distillation (PTC-SGMD) platform, simultaneously generating freshwater and hydrogen. The SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MX@PVDF interface leverages broad-spectrum solar absorption, efficient heat/mass transfer, and gas&#8211;solid catalysis to achieve high flux, robust H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, and long-term stability, highlighting a sustainable water&#8211;energy solution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancements in solar-driven processes are fundamentally transforming the production of freshwater and energy into a more sustainable manner. Realizing such potential requires developing highly efficient solar responsive materials and advanced solar systems. Here, an MXene-based membrane is reported as a multifunctional interface capable of simultaneously producing freshwater and hydrogen through a strategically designed photothermal-catalytic sweeping gas membrane distillation (PTC-SGMD) system. By leveraging membrane interface engineering, the innovative design integrates solar evaporation, vapor transportation, and vapor splitting within a single membrane. Unlike conventional liquid&#8211;solid systems, this liquid&#8211;solid&#8211;gas configuration overcomes photocatalyst leaching, interfacial heat loss, and inefficient mass transfer. The multifunctional membrane exhibits enhanced solar absorption and optimal permeability, enabling the MXene-photocatalyst composite to achieve efficient photocatalytic vapor splitting. Remarkably, the optimized SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/MX@PVDF membrane achieves a simultaneous water flux of 2.37&#160;kg&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrogen production of 947.8&#160;&#181;mol m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under 1 sun irradiation. The PTC-SGMD system demonstrates total solar efficiency of 92.305% with outstanding stability over 72 h of continuous operation. This innovative approach offers a scalable solution to global water scarcity and energy challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silver Ions as Ambipolar Dopants in InAs Nanocrystal Solids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag&#8314; ions post&#8208;introduced into InAs nanocrystal films act as ambipolar dopants whose effect depends on host polarity and dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, Ag&#8314; occupies interstitial sites to yield n&#8208;type doping effect, whereas in Zn&#8208;doped p&#8208;type InAs nanocrystal films, it first forms p&#8208;type surface doping effect and later induces n&#8208;type doping effect, enabling polarity&#8208;tunable III&#8211;V nanocrystal devices.








Abstract
The precise control of semiconductor polarity in nanocrystals (NCs) is crucial for optimizing device performance in various optoelectronic applications. In this study, it is shown that Ag&#8314;, added post&#8208;synthetically to InAs NCs using an AgNO3 solution, can induce either n&#8208;type or p&#8208;type doping of the solid, depending on the intrinsic polarity of the host and the dopant concentration. In n&#8208;type InAs NCs, Ag&#8314; consistently acts as an interstitial n&#8208;type dopant, shifting the conduction band minimum closer to the Fermi level. Conversely, in p&#8208;type InAs NCs (innately doped with Zn during synthesis), Ag&#8314; initially exhibits a p&#8208;type doping effect at low concentrations by forming surface dipoles but transitions to an n&#8208;type doping effect at higher concentrations through interstitial incorporation. These results offer a unified understanding of the intricate and adjustable doping behavior of Ag&#8314; in colloidal NC systems and present new opportunities for post&#8208;synthetic polarity engineering in III&#8211;V nanomaterials.

         <title>Autonomous Spatiotemporal Regulation of Reversible Hydrogel Actuators by Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators with reversible response to thiols are developed using reversible binding of thiols to Michael acceptors. Autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible movement of these hydrogels is achieved using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks containing both positive and negative feedback.








Abstract
Achieving autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel movement remains challenging, as existing approaches typically rely on external regulation or irreversible actuation mechanisms. This work presents the autonomous spatiotemporal regulation of reversible hydrogel actuators using thiol&#8208;based chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The core innovation is a bilayer actuator whose active layer is functionalized with phenylcyanoacrylate Michael acceptors. In their initial state, these groups are hydrophobic, keeping the active layer moderately collapsed. Binding to thiols, such as cysteamine or thiocholine, converts the acceptors into more hydrophilic adducts. This change drives water uptake, causing the active layer to swell and the entire structure to bend. The screening revealed that a methoxy&#8208;substituted acceptor provides the optimal balance of binding strength and reversibility for robust actuation. Autonomous control of reversible actuation is achieved by an autocatalytic, thiol&#8208;producing CRN coupled with negative feedback in the form of slow oxidation of thiols or their irreversible addition to acrylamides. In the hydrogel, this CRN generates a wave of thiols, which causes forward and reverse actuation. This principle is demonstrated with linear, flower&#8208;shaped, and hand&#8208;like actuators. This integrated system, which unites reversible chemistry with spatiotemporal control, takes a significant step toward emulating the autonomy of motion found in living systems.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Fluorinated Gases by Porous Organic Cages &#8211; Effects of Fluorinated Side&#8208;Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of a series of porous organic cages with perfluorinated alkyl side&#8208;chains of different lengths is presented. The structure&#8208;property relationship of the various cages on gas sorption of highly potent greenhouse gases, such as perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is investigated. Very high selectivities have been obtained especially for PFC&#8208;218 and PFC&#8208;318.








Abstract
Perfluorocarbons (PFCs) as well as related gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) or nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) are examples of F&#8208;gases, a subclass of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). F&#8208;gases are anthropogenic greenhouse gases with the highest global warming potentials known and thus contribute significantly to global warming. To reduce their amount in the atmosphere, selectively adsorbing materials would be beneficial, but such materials are rare. A homologous series of porous organic cages with fluorinated side&#8208;chains is synthesized and depending on the targeted gas as well as operating temperature, different cages have high selectivities for certain F&#8208;gases against N2, CO2, and O2. Within this series, new benchmark selectivities against, e.g., perfluoro propane (PFC&#8208;218) and perfluoro cyclobutane (PFC&#8208;318) have been achieved based on attractive fluorine&#8208;fluorine interactions. Furthermore, these interactions are exploited for the first time in the adsorption of sulfur hexafluoride and nitrogen trifluoride.

         <title>In Situ Formation of LiF&#8208;Rich SEI in Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes Enables Long&#8208;Life Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) incorporating PVTC enables in situ formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) that stabilizes WO3/NiO electrochromic devices. Using a salt&#8208;pressed configuration, the first direct FIB&#8211;TEM observation of the SEI at the WO3/solid&#8208;electrolyte interface is achieved. This QSPE delivers large optical modulation (&gt;45%), rapid response, and exceptional durability over 40 000 cycles.








Abstract
Electrochromic devices (ECDs) offer significant energy&#8208;saving potential for applications such as smart windows and displays by modulating optical properties in response to electrical stimuli. However, their widespread adoption is limited by challenges associated with electrolyte stability and the formation of a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). In this study, a novel quasi&#8208;solid polymer electrolyte (QSPE) based on a UV&#8208;curable matrix of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) incorporated with poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene) [P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE), abbreviated as PVTC] is presented. The high dielectric constant of PVTC facilitates lithium&#8208;ion transport, while electrochemical cycling triggers partial dehydrofluorination, thereby promoting in situ formation of a LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer on WO3 surface. The optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent properties, including high optical transparency (88.7%), ionic conductivity (1.76 mS cm&#8722;1), and mechanical robustness. When applied in ECDs, PVTC enables outstanding performance, achieving 86.29% optical retention from the 5000th to the 40 000th cycle and 98.78% charge retention after 50 000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Furthermore, prototype demonstrations in smart windows and electrochromic sunglasses validate the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system, highlighting a promising strategy for advancing durable, high&#8208;performance ECDs through innovative electrolyte design.

The optimized electrolyte exhibits excellent properties, including high optical transparency (88.7%), ionic conductivity (1.76 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and mechanical robustness. When applied in ECDs, PVTC enables outstanding performance, achieving 86.29% optical retention from the 5000th to the 40 000th cycle and 98.78% charge retention after 50 000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Furthermore, prototype demonstrations in smart windows and electrochromic sunglasses validate the scalability and flexibility of the proposed system, highlighting a promising strategy for advancing durable, high-performance ECDs through innovative electrolyte design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Melt Densification Enables Fracture&#8208;Resistant Blend Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt densification of miscible polymers enables the formation of highly entangled blend hydrogels with exceptional fracture resistance. The resulting networks combine high stiffness and fatigue thresholds with optical transparency, oxygen permeability, and antifouling performance. This generalizable approach provides a straightforward strategy to design robust functional hydrogels for biomedical and electronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogels and elastomers are integral components in biomedical and electronics devices, but their toughness and crack resistance are often unsatisfactory for load&#8208;bearing applications. Synthetic polymer networks predominantly rely on solution fabrication, which compromises the ultimate mechanical properties. This work presents a universal melt crosslinking strategy, which densifies entanglements well beyond solvated conditions. When deformed, mutually entangled dissimilar chains stiffen the gels, while sparse crosslinks amplify fracture resistance. At water contents up to 83%, the resultant hydrogels demonstrate over 2 orders increase in mechanical properties, including moduli (1.3&#8211;35 MPa), toughness (0.7&#8211;24.5 kJ/m2), and fatigue thresholds (1.2&#8211;3.3 kJ/m2), tunable in a wide range beyond existing hydrogels. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high optical clarity (&gt;96%), oxygen permeability (Dk/t &gt; 40), and anti&#8208;fouling properties (&lt;0.6&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2). This generalizable strategy could guide the design of tough functional soft materials in fields such as healthcare and smart electronics.

         <title>Polymer&#8211;Perovskite Microcrystal Heterojunction for Self&#8208;Powered Optical Sensing and Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable fabrication strategy is demonstrated for self&#8208;powered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction (PPMC HJ) photodetectors with clean interfaces and excellent performance: ultralow dark current, high dark&#8208;to&#8208;light ratio, fast response, and long&#8208;term stability. Design optimization boosted yield to 38%. KPFM revealed the Br&#8722; vacancy effects. Integration into an LISF converter validated its potential for next&#8208;gen optoelectronic and optical communication applications.








Abstract
The quasiepitaxial polymer&#8208;perovskite interface is a critical enabler for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics, offering opulent features of efficient exciton dissociation and carrier transport. However, interfacial complexities, including energy barriers, poor interface, and defect states, pose significant challenges to scalability and performance. This study maps the nanoscale barrier landscape across the polymer&#8208;perovskite interface, revealing excellent photodetection performance and robust optical communication capacity. A tactical quasiepitaxial growth approach enables the fabrication of a high&#8208;yield inorganic&#8211;organic abrupt hybrid heterojunction (HHJ) photodetector by integrating CsPbBr3 monocrystal with a patterned poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene&#8208;2,5&#8208;diyl) (P3HT) film. This strategy boosts the fabrication yield from 5% to 38% and exhibits significant autonomous light&#8208;sensing performance, including an ultra&#8208;low dark current of below 10 fA at room temperature, a substantial dark&#8208;to&#8208;light conductivity ratio exceeding 106, a linear dynamic range (LDR) of &#8776;132.2&#160;dB, and an open&#8208;circuit photovoltage of &#8776;0.7&#160;V. The critical role of Br&#8722; vacancies in governing the photoelectrical behavior of the polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunction&#160;(PPMC HJ) device is revealed precisely at the nanoscale using various advanced KPFM techniques. Additionally, a light&#8208;to&#8208;frequency converter demonstrates its advanced sensing capabilities. These findings highlight the importance of precision&#8208;engineered polymer&#8208;perovskite microcrystal heterojunctions in overcoming current performance bottlenecks, paving the way for scalable, ultrafast photonic devices with superior performance and reliability.

         <title>Deterministic Switching of Antipolar Variants in Antiferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;beam engineering of freestanding PbZrO3 membranes enables selective and reversible switching between in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antiferroelectric domain variants. By tuning the built&#8208;in electric field through beam focusing, deterministic control of antipolar order is achieved. This programmable, non&#8208;contact approach offers a general strategy for reconfigurable domain engineering in perovskite antiferroelectrics and nanoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, characterized by their antiparallel dipole alignments, offer distinct ferroic functionalities desirable for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage and next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices. However, the intrinsic degeneracy among antipolar domain variants poses a critical obstacle to their deterministic, nonvolatile control and practical integration into functional architectures. Here, selective and reversible manipulation of AFE domain configurations in freestanding PbZrO3 membranes via electron beam irradiation are demonstrated. By tailoring the electron beam&#8211;induced built&#8208;in electric field, controlled writing and erasure of both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane antipolar domain variants are enabled. Complementary phase&#8208;field simulations uncover the underlying energetic landscape and domain evolution under varying irradiation conditions, offering mechanistic insight into the observed transformations. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy for domain&#8208;level engineering of antiferroelectrics, establishing a generic and programmable approach to deterministically control antipolar ordering in perovskite systems&#8212;suggesting a pathway toward controlled, reversible switching of AFE domains in nanoscale oxide architectures.

         <title>Artificial Microtubules from Microrobot Swarm Unraveling for Directed Cargo Transport under Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by molecular transport on microtubules, here it is shown that artificial microtubules can spontaneously form when propelling microrobot swarms encounter pointwise or edgewise confinements and work effectively for cargo transport in biological setting such as in blood, making it a particularly exciting delivery platform.








Abstract
Cargo transport on artificial microtubules (AMTs) has been extensively explored in various biomedical applications, including drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, the transport velocity and directional controllability are still poor compared to their natural counterparts, especially under confinement. Here, we show that confinement can induce the spontaneous formation of AMTs from structural transformations of microrobot swarms, and that these AMTs are particularly adept at directionally controlled cargo transport. It is shown that a magnetically driven microrobot cluster, when locally pinned, can be unraveled along the boundary into a strand that can function as a microtubule thanks to collective tangential flows. We demonstrate with both experiments and simulations that the local pinning required for AMT formation can come from a single pinned particle, or from corners and necks ubiquitous in microchannels and cavities. By modulating the driving magnetic field, the microtubule formation process can be precisely manipulated following periodic perturbations and re&#8208;establishments of local order, thereby simultaneously controlling the velocity and direction of cargo transport. The general applicability of this method has also been tested in biological environments including flowing blood, as well as in an in vitro delivery model under confinement.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Controlled MUC1 Ablation via Steric Locking of Turn&#8208;On Reactors Enhances Pyroptosis&#8208;Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered theranostic reactor is developed, which could bind to MUC1 on glycoengineered triple&#8208;negative breast cancer cells and enter a sterically locked state. It inactivates MUC1 under remotely&#8208;controlled light signals while enabling in&#8208;situ visualization of membrane MUC1, leading to a potent pyroptosis&#8208;associated immunostimulatory effect.








Abstract
Mucin 1 (MUC1) is aberrantly upregulated in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells and presents major roles in orchestrating TNBC pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance. Herein, a bioorthogonal MUC1&#8208;binding strategy is reported to install MUC1&#8208;lockable aggregation&#8208;induced emission theranostic reactor (AIETR) onto MUC1 for pyroptosis&#8208;immunotherapy while enabling in situ MUC1 visualization. TNBC&#8208;bearing hosts are first treated with 1,3,4&#8208;O&#8208;acetyl&#8208;N&#8208;azidoacetylmannosamine&#8208;containing bioresponsive nanoassemblies to generate azido groups on MUC1 via sialic acid metabolism pathway. Dibenzocyclooctyne and MUC1&#8208;binding aptamer arms in AIETR can separately bind with azide moieties and aptamer binding domains in MUC1 of glycoengineered TNBC cells and restrict intramolecular rotation to activate their AIE&#8208;dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and fluorescence imaging capacity. The proximity&#8208;dependent ROS damage abolishes membrane MUC1 to activate pyroptosis cascades. Moreover, treatment&#8208;enabled MUC1 inactivation also ameliorates MUC1&#8208;dependent immunosuppression in TNBC microenvironment to boost anti&#8208;TNBC immunity. This study offers an effective approach for precision TNBC theranostics in the clinic.

         <title>Chimeric Glycoprotein Nanoparticles Elicit Robust Neutralizing Antibodies Against Epstein&#8211;Barr Virus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epstein&#8211;Barr virus (EBV) lacks vaccines/therapeutics despite causing cancers. Chimeric nanoparticles co&#8208;displaying EBV's gB/gHgL fusion apparatus are designed. These induce stronger neutralizing antibodies than cocktails in animals, mimicking whole&#8208;virion antibody patterns. Single&#8208;BCR sequencing reveals a novel gB&#8208;targeting neutralizing antibody (Fab5) to a new site. This strategy offers potent EBV vaccine candidates and insights for multi&#8208;antigen pathogens.








Abstract
Epstein&#8210;Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous gammaherpesvirus linked to a broad spectrum of malignancies and autoimmune diseases with no approved therapeutic drugs or vaccines. EBV infection relies on the viral glycoproteins gB and gHgL, which, together, function as the fusion apparatus, mediating viral recognition and membrane fusion in both epithelial and B cells. Despite discovering potent neutralizing antibodies targeting gB and gHgL, the heterogeneous antigen structures and distribution of multiple glycoproteins in the virion hinder rational vaccine design targeting this apparatus complex. In this study, Chimeric nanoparticles (Chimeric&#8208;NPs) are designed that co&#8208;display EBV fusion apparatus and induce significantly more neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates than the cocktail counterparts. It is further demonstrated that the Chimeric&#8208;NPs elicited neutralizing antibodies predominantly targeting gB, closely mimicking the antibody induction pattern by the whole EBV virion. Additionally, single&#8208;BCR sequencing is used to analyze the B cell response to Chimeric&#8208;NP, and a novel gB neutralizing antibody Fab5 targeting a new vulnerable site EBV gB is identified. These findings provide novel candidates and vaccine design strategies for EBV and reveal the underlying mechanisms of antibody induction and immune response regulation by chimera vaccines, with potential implications for all multi&#8208;antigen&#8208;harbored pathogens.

         <title>High Thermal Conductivity Porous Organic Polymers with Low Permittivity via Desolvation&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films via PEG&#8208;induced desolvation. This strategy creates uniform micropores (reducing permittivity to 1.44, &#8208;73.1%) while simultaneously promoting PAN chain reorganization into aligned crystalline domains. This enhances thermal conductivity tenfold to 1.39 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1, overcoming the typical permittivity&#8208;thermal conductivity trade&#8208;off in organics. As a thermal interface material, P&#8208;PAN reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Miniaturization of microelectronic devices demand organic dielectric polymers with ultralow permittivity (k &lt; 2.0) and high thermal conductivity (&#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) to mitigate signal delay and thermal accumulation. However, organic polymers inherently face a trade&#8208;off: porosity reduces k but sacrifices &#955; due to disordered pores and interchain hopping barriers. Here, a desolvation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly strategy is proposed, fabricating all organic porous polyacrylonitrile (P&#8208;PAN) films. By incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a porogen and plasticizer, followed by water exchange and freeze drying, the P&#8208;PAN film features uniform microscale holes, which reduce dipole density and electronic polarization, resulting in k to 1.44 (73.1% reduction from PAN). Simultaneously, PEG&#8208;induce hydrogen bonds enable PAN chains mobility, promoting the reorganization of amorphous chains into crystalline domains during desolvation. This ordered framework facilitates efficient phonon transport via crystalline domains, elevating &#955; to 1.39&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, nearly tenfold improvement over PAN (0.13&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Notably, P&#8208;PAN synergizes k &lt; 2.0 and &#955; &gt; 1.0 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1 without fillers, surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic polymers. As a proof of concept, P&#8208;PAN as a thermal interface material (TIM) reduces chip temperature by 5.7&#160;&#176;C, decoupling the k&#8208;&#955; trade&#8208;offs in organic polymers and demonstrating its potential for flexible electronics.

         <title>Integrated TRNG and PUF Based on Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescent Polymer Dielectric Gated Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed that incorporates a photoactivable RTP film as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, giving two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) and photocurrent (Id), enabling integrated true random number generator (TRNG) and physical unclonable function (PUF) functionalities.








Abstract
Harnessing the entropy of multiple transitions between different electronic states in room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) not only overcomes the drawbacks of authentication via afterglow but also holds significant potential for cryptographic protocols that are immune to attacks from future quantum computers. However, such an objective has yet to be realized. Here, RTP films are incorporated as a dielectric layer in phototransistors, which give two distinct outputs, i.e., phosphorescence (Ip) from the dielectric layer and photocurrent (Id) across the source&#8208;drain electrode. The susceptible thermodynamics of electron transitions and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet energy transfer at the dielectric&#8208;semiconductor interface causing Ip to vary with each readout, thereby enabling true random number generator (TRNG) functionality. Whereas Id is mainly governed by film quality and interfacial defects, which vary among different batches due to inherent randomness introduced during fabrication, making it suitable as a physical unclonable function (PUF). Detailed studies reveal that the two outputs demonstrate excellent uniqueness and independence, with a Hamming weight of 0.50, an inter&#8208;Hamming distance of 50.27%, a Pearson correlation coefficient of &#8722;0.0054, and an encoding capacity of 225 within a 5 &#215; 5 transistor array. This work represents a breakthrough of integrated optoelectronic devices for highly secure authentication while also inspiring new applications for RTP materials.

         <title>Isotropic Energy&#8208;Absorbing Metamaterial with Tensegrity&#8208;Inspired Architecture and Auxetic Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of tensile properties enables adjustment of the spring's stiffness coefficient, achieving overall stiffness regulation while offering self&#8208;recovery and anti&#8208;fatigue capabilities. By leveraging negative Poisson's ratio properties, the seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral metamaterials significantly mitigate impact loads during shock testing. Additionally, the assembly strategy of unit cells is expanded to fabricate multidimensional metamaterials.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials exhibit significant potential for energy absorption applications through rational structural design. Negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) metamaterials have drawn particular attention due to their unique auxetic behavior, though their limited functionality restricts energy absorption capacity. This study develops a novel metamaterial combining NPR characteristics with tensegrity structure advantages to address traditional energy&#8208;absorbing materials' limitations in durability, self&#8208;recovery, and dynamic adjustability. By reconfiguring tensegrity modules into programmable units using spring combinations and implementing directional deformation constraints through rigid sliding rod and linear slider systems, the auxetic mechanism of NPR materials is integrated with tensegrity's programmable features. Experimental results demonstrate precise control of global auxetic response and overall stiffness through spring stiffness adjustment, with the elastic element combination providing self&#8208;recovery and fatigue resistance (only 0.40% energy absorption variation after 10000 compression cycles). For structural assembly, seven&#8208;cell and tetrahedral configurations achieve peak force reductions of &#8776;75.68&#160;&#177;&#160;1.22% and 91.18&#160;&#177;&#160;0.40% respectively, under impact, demonstrating assembly strategy scalability. This research breaks through traditional single&#8208;material metamaterial limitations by integrating tensegrity structures with NPR effects, establishing a new paradigm for developing intelligent protective materials with both tunable energy absorption characteristics and enhanced durability.

         <title>Chip&#8208;Scale Graphene/IGZO Cold Source FET Array Enabling Sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 Super&#8208;Steep Subthreshold Swing</title>

         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is demonstrated in graphene/IGZO cold source transistor arrays. Linear density of states with Dirac cone in graphene suppressed the Boltzmann thermal tail, while high&#8208;k HfO2 dielectric having small body factor enhanced gating efficiency, hereby further reducing SS. An average SS of &#8776;46.4 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved in the array, enabling ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;speed electronics.








Abstract
In this study, the first sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 super&#8208;steep subthreshold swing (SS) of graphene/InGaZnO (IGZO) cold&#8208;source field&#8208;effect transistor (CSFET) arrays is demonstrated. The linear density of states of the Dirac&#8208;cone&#8208;type graphene suppresses the Boltzmann thermal tail near the graphene/IGZO interface which in turn causes super&#8208;exponentially decaying electron density with increasing energy, leading to an extremely low off current and SS value. In particular, by introducing an HfO2 high&#8208;k dielectric with a low body factor, the surface potential is effectively modulated, further reducing SS by &#8776;46.4 mV dec&#8722;1. Furthermore, highly uniform sub&#8208;60 mV dec&#8722;1 SS with a yield of &#8776;89.1% is achieved in the IGZO CSFET 8 &#215; 8 array devices, with a record SS value of 23.66 mV dec&#8722;1 compared to previously reported oxide&#8208;semiconductor transistors. The proposed IGZO CSFET device is expected to drive significant advancements in high&#8208;speed and ultralow&#8208;power electronic circuits.

         <title>Chiral Nanoagonist Targeting EGFR for Nerve Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chiral nanoagonist is proposed to effectively activate EGFR for nerve injury repair. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods promote cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in a chirality&#8208;dependent manner through EGFR signaling networks. Further incorporated into a biodegradable bandage, enhanced nerve regeneration and function recovery are demonstrated in both peripheral and central nervous system injury models.








Abstract
Nerve injury repair is limited by the incapacity to regenerate neurons in the nervous system. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays an important role in the development of the nervous system, but its potential in nerve regeneration and repair has remained underappreciated. Herein, a chiral nanoagonist, D&#8208;Histidine ZnO nanorods (NRs), is reported to effectively activate EGFR and initiate multiple downstream cascade signaling pathways, promoting nerve cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration in three different types of neural cells. D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs not only achieve more than 85% differentiation rate (with neurite length larger than 50 &#181;m), but also induce the transdifferentiating of Schwann cells into a stem&#8208;like phenotype. A biodegradable band&#8208;aid&#8208;like bandage incorporating D&#8208;Histidine ZnO NRs is developed and applied in nerve injury repair in both sciatic nerve and spinal cord injury models. The neurorestoration and functional recovery are significantly improved after 4&#8208;week therapy. This study reveals that chirality&#8208;dependent regulation of nerve cell behavior by chiral nanoagonist targeting EGFR is a pioneering and promising strategy in nerve regeneration therapies.

         <title>Origin of B&#8208;Type Blinking at 2D/3D Heterojunction Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
B&#8209;type photoluminescence blinking is observed in WS2/Si heterojunctions, originating from the competition between two hot&#8209;carrier relaxation pathways either leading to A exciton or localized exciton formation. F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer sustains the blinking by modulating localized exciton density. This finding broadens the understanding of carrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems and help the degsin of stable optoelectronic device. 








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking is a common phenomenon that occurs across various low&#8208;dimensional materials, like 0D quantum dots or 1D nanowires. Two blinking types in 0D and 1D systems have been observed and extensively studied, revealing the mechanisms of non&#8208;equilibrium photocarrier kinetics, thereby enhancing emission stability and optimizing emitter performance. However, the origin of blinking in 2D materials is still less understood compared to those in quantum dots and single molecules and only the A&#8208;type blinking has been reported. Here, a B&#8208;type photoluminescence blinking is identified at the WS2/Si heterointerface through the statistics of fluorescence lifetime&#8208;intensity distribution. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and transient absorption spectra show that the blinking arises from the dynamic competition between two hot carrier relaxation pathways: one leading to A exciton emission and the other to localized exciton recombination. Moreover, F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer modulates the localized exciton density at the heterointerface and sustains the blinking phenomenon, which is distinct from other B&#8208;type blinking. This B&#8208;type blinking broadens the understanding of photocarrier dynamics in 2D/3D systems, which will benefit the development of optoelectronic devices based on 2D materials.

         <title>Michell's&#8208;Instability&#8208;Mediated Fast Reconfiguration of Hydrogel&#8208;Based Ring Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anisotropic hydrogel&#8208;based ring actuator exhibits fast reconfiguration from a saddle&#8208;shape to a figure of eight upon heating or light irradiation, resulting in varied stiffnesses of the gel and reduced critical twist of the ring for Michell's instability. Such ring actuators with fast rotational deformation are harnessed for executing specific tasks.








Abstract
Michell's instability, a classic type of mechanical instability, has received tremendous interest from different disciplines. It occurs when the pre&#8208;torsion in an elastic ring surpasses a critical value; the elastic ring spontaneously undergoes a transition from a flat or warped shape to a figure&#8208;of&#8208;eight configuration.

&lt;p&gt;An anisotropic hydrogel-based ring actuator exhibits fast reconfiguration from a saddle-shape to a figure of eight upon heating or light irradiation, resulting in varied stiffnesses of the gel and reduced critical twist of the ring for Michell's instability. Such ring actuators with fast rotational deformation are harnessed for executing specific tasks.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michell's instability, a classic type of mechanical instability, has received tremendous interest from different disciplines. It occurs when the pre-torsion in an elastic ring surpasses a critical value; the elastic ring spontaneously undergoes a transition from a flat or warped shape to a figure-of-eight configuration. However, such instability has rarely been exploited in designing soft actuators. Here, by employing a stimulus-triggered Michell's instability, hydrogel-based ring actuators capable of fast shape morphing are developed. Upon heating or light irradiation, the hydrogel ring transforms rapidly from the saddle-shape into the figure-of-eight configuration. Rigorous experiments and simulations reveal the underlying mechanism and attribute it to the stimuli-induced variations in bending and torsional stiffnesses of the gel string with anisotropic structure and response, which reduces the critical twist for Michell's instability of the ring actuator. Moreover, effects of light intensity, environmental temperature, ring size, and pre-torsion on reconfiguration are also investigated. The fast action of the ring actuators in aqueous conditions has been demonstrated through various tasks, such as screwing a bottle cap, kicking a ball, and triggering synergetic deformations. The design principle of soft actuators by harnessing Michell's instability should merit the development of other soft machines with fast action and large-amplitude reconfiguration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong field&#8208;free superconducting diode effect (SDE) in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are demonstrated and achieved by combining engineered geometric asymmetry with stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. The devices reach 54% field&#8208;free diode efficiency&#8212;the highest reported for simple, fully CMOS&#8208;compatible ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers made by standard thin&#8208;film processes.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which manifests as directional, dissipationless supercurrents, is pivotal for realizing energy&#8208;efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. However, achieving high&#8208;efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields remains a fundamental challenge. In this study, a strongly enhanced, field&#8208;free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures are proposed, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field&#8208;free values in ferromagnet/superconductor multilayers. Temperature&#8208; and field&#8208;dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity results from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz&#8208;force imbalance. These findings establish a CMOS&#8208;compatible platform for high&#8208;performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

         <title>Trace&#8208;Level Green Bio&#8208;Derived Amino Acid Molecular Leveling Agent Enables Dendrite&#8208;Free and Long&#8208;Lifespan Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;derived BICINE is introduced as a green and efficient leveling agent to regulate Zn2+ solvation structure and guide uniform Zn nucleation. It also promotes the formation of a stable organic/inorganic hybrid SEI, effectively suppressing dendrites and side reactions, achieving over 5400 h of stable cycling at 5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The poor reversibility of Zn metal anodes, caused by dendrite growth and water&#8208;induced side reactions, hinders the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). To address these issues, regulating Zn2+ solvation structure, controlling nucleation behavior, and constructing a robust solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial. Herein, a trace&#8208;level (10&#160;mg mL&#8722;1) bio&#8208;derived surface&#8208;leveling agent, N,N&#8208;dihydroxyethyl glycine (BICINE), is introduced to tailor the interfacial environment. With multiple coordinating groups, BICINE adsorbs onto the Zn surface, homogenizes nucleation, reconstructs solvation sheath, and induces a hybrid SEI. Meanwhile, it promotes the formation of a uniform cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), stabilizing cathode morphology and preventing irreversible degradation. These synergistic effects suppress dendrite growth and parasitic reactions, enabling highly reversible Zn plating/stripping. Consequently, symmetric Zn||Zn cells demonstrate remarkable stability, with the capability to operate for over 5,300&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 and maintain stable performance at a high depth of discharge (88.2%). Asymmetric Cu||Zn cells exhibit exceptional Coulombic efficiency of 99.9% over 1,650 cycles. Even with a low N/P ratio of 3, Zn||NH4V4O10 full cells retain 89.7% of their capacity after 250 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. The low&#8208;cost BICINE strategy holds great promise for advancing the commercialization of AZIBs.

         <title>Electrical Catalysis of Forbidden Transitions in Single&#8208;Molecule Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical reaction that is typically symmetry&#8208;forbidden (norbornadiene (NBD) to quadricyclane (QC)) is catalyzed in a single&#8208;molecule junction using a combination of nanoconfinement and electrical catalysis. It occurs when the molecular junction is sterically driven into a configuration that is far from the ground state prior to applying the activating voltage as revealed by simultaneous single&#8208;molecule break&#8208;junction and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Molecular orbital symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining chemical reaction mechanisms. The process of changing chemical reactants into products must transition along a pathway that conserves molecular orbital symmetry to ensure continuity. This principle is so fundamental that reactions that do not conserve symmetry are typically considered &#8220;forbidden&#8221; due to the high resultant energy barriers. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to electrically catalyze these forbidden transitions when a single molecule is bound between two electrodes in a nanoscale junction. A cycloaddition reaction is induced in a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, converting it to quadricyclane (QC) by utilizing nanoconfinement to place the molecule into a configuration that is far from equilibrium and applying a small voltage to the molecular junction. Traditionally, this reaction can only be induced photochemically due to orbital symmetry selection rules. By directly tracking the reaction dynamics in situ using single&#8208;molecule Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that for this reaction to be electrically catalyzed the molecule must be sterically maneuvered into a configuration near the transition state at the peak of the energy barrier prior to applying the voltage needed to successfully induce the forbidden transition is applied.

         <title>Sieving Hydrogen Isotopes via Machine Learning Assisted Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of High&#8208;Quality Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h&#8208;BN) on Iron Foils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine h&#8208;BN membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge.

Abstract
Atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ceramics, such as monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), present potential for disruptive advances in separations. However, sub&#8208;atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H+/D+) require near pristine 2D material membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high&#8208;quality h&#8208;BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. Here, we&#160;report a scalable Fe&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for bottom&#8208;up synthesis of large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN films, overcoming key limitations of conventional ammonia&#8208;based routes. By leveraging mechanistic insights and higher CVD temperatures, we&#160;suppress multilayer formation and achieve uniform monolayer h&#8208;BN coverage on commercially available Fe foils. Machine learning enables systematic exploration of the complex, multi&#8208;dimensional CVD parameter space (growth time, temperature, precursor temperature, multilayer faction, coverage), providing data&#8208;driven approaches to visualize and identify process regimes facilitating predominantly monolayer h&#8208;BN growth with minimal secondary nuclei/ad&#8208;layers. The optimized Fe&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes show high&#8208;quality as observed by proton/deuteron (H+/D+) selectivity &#8776;8.45, approaching the highest quality benchmark of mechanically exfoliated h&#8208;BN (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;10) as well as significantly outperforming Cu&#8208;catalyzed CVD h&#8208;BN membranes (H+/D+ selectivity &#8776;3.62, control selectivity &#8776;1.7). Our work provides a scalable cost&#8208;effective route for high&#8208;quality monolayer h&#8208;BN synthesis for sub&#8208;atomic scale separations (H+/D+) and demonstrates the broader potential of machine learning&#8208;guided optimization of CVD for advancing synthesis of 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;Atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) ceramics, such as monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), present potential for disruptive advances in separations. However, sub-atomic scale separation of hydrogen isotopes (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) require near pristine 2D material membranes, and scalable synthesis of such high-quality h-BN comparable to mechanically exfoliated crystals remains a significant challenge. Here, we&#160;report a scalable Fe-catalyzed chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for bottom-up synthesis of large-area, high-quality monolayer h-BN films, overcoming key limitations of conventional ammonia-based routes. By leveraging mechanistic insights and higher CVD temperatures, we&#160;suppress multilayer formation and achieve uniform monolayer h-BN coverage on commercially available Fe foils. Machine learning enables systematic exploration of the complex, multi-dimensional CVD parameter space (growth time, temperature, precursor temperature, multilayer faction, coverage), providing data-driven approaches to visualize and identify process regimes facilitating predominantly monolayer h-BN growth with minimal secondary nuclei/ad-layers. The optimized Fe-catalyzed CVD &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN membranes show high-quality as observed by proton/deuteron (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) selectivity &#8776;8.45, approaching the highest quality benchmark of mechanically exfoliated h-BN (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity &#8776;10) as well as significantly outperforming Cu-catalyzed CVD &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;-BN membranes (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity &#8776;3.62, control selectivity &#8776;1.7). Our work provides a scalable cost-effective route for high-quality monolayer h-BN synthesis for sub-atomic scale separations (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/D&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and demonstrates the broader potential of machine learning-guided optimization of CVD for advancing synthesis of 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Sono&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform Integrating STING Activation and CXCR4 Blockade for Synergistic Immunotherapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;function therapeutic platform that integrates ultrasound&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy, STING pathway activation, and CXCR4 inhibition for synergistic immunotherapy of glioblastoma is presented. This approach not only facilitates robust innate and adaptive immune activation but also significantly inhibits tumor growth and recurrence in glioblastoma&#8208;bearing mice, offering a promising strategy to overcome the immunosuppressive barriers.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor with a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment, remains a therapeutic challenge due to its resistance to conventional treatments. In this study, a novel multi&#8208;function therapeutic platform that integrates ultrasound&#8208;triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), STING pathway activation, and CXCR4 inhibition for synergistic immunotherapy of GBM is presented. Through systematic comparison of a series of organic molecules with subtle substituted atom alterations, a new selenium&#8208;containing compound is identified with outstanding sonodynamic properties. The high&#8208;performance sonosensitizer is co&#8208;assembled with a STING agonist prodrug, which is further cloaked with glioma cell membrane and CXCR4&#8208;targeting peptides for dual homing and immune modulation. Under ultrasound irradiation, the nanoplatform triggers robust reactive oxygen species production, in combination with the self&#8208;accelerating STING agonist release, significantly stimulating both innate and adaptive immune responses while disrupting the CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis to suppress immunosuppressive cell infiltration. This tripartite strategy, which integrates SDT&#8208;mediated tumor ablation, STING&#8208;induced systemic immunity, and CXCR4 blockade, synergistically suppresses primary tumor growth, prevents postoperative recurrence, and extends survival in GBM&#8208;bearing mice. This approach presents a promising sono&#8208;triggered multimodal paradigm for overcoming GBM's immunosuppressive barriers and enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Infrared and Thermo Co&#8208;Driven Catalysis for CO2 Conversion to Valuable Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome thermal bottlenecks in direct dimethyl carbonate synthesis, infrared photon energy is coupled with gentle heating on vacancy&#8208;rich CeO2. Vacancy states absorb IR and generate holes with moderate potentials, guiding selective CO2&#8211;methanol conversion, and heat expedites carrier relaxation, resulting in the DMC production rate of &#8764;30 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity, demonstrating an IR&#8211;thermo synergy for CO2 utilisation.








Abstract
Conversion of CO2 into high value chemicals presents a promising pathway for CO2 mitigation and utilisation. The direct synthesis of dimethyl carbonate from CO2 and methanol is one of such carbon&#8208;neutral pathways. However, thermal catalytic processes for direct dimethyl carbonate synthesis have reached a performance bottleneck at elevated temperatures. This work explores the synergy of photon and thermal energy to enhance the dimethyl carbonate production rate to 30&#160;mmol/g/h, together with 100% selectivity, thanks to a defect&#8208;modified and noble&#8208;metal free cerium oxide catalyst. Fundamentally, it is found that the defects in cerium oxide can provide energy levels that enable IR light absorption and generate holes with a moderate oxidation potential, so avoiding the unfavorable overoxidation pathway and enhancing the production rate of dimethyl carbonate. The thermal energy has been proved to remarkably facilitate the relaxation of IR&#8208;induced charge carriers and to enhance the dimethyl carbonate formation process. This work introduces a strategy of IR photons and thermo co&#8208;driven catalysis and achieves a breakthrough in dimethyl carbonate formation.

         <title>Terahertz Multi&#8208;State Reconfigurable Holographic Metasurface Based on Full&#8208;Stokes Magnetic Eigen&#8208;Modulation of Photonic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eigen propagation states in the photonic Weyl semimetal cover the normalized full&#8208;Stokes parameter, which can be modulated by the magnetic vector at the magnetized plasma frequency, following a projection relationship. Coupled with the vectorial holography, a multi&#8208;state reconfigurable holographic metasurface is achieved, providing a new paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity.








Abstract
The metasurface is limited by the fixed microstructure to integrate more reconfigurable functional states, making it indispensable to introduce active materials. Nowadays, attributing to the nontrivial topological properties, the photonic Weyl semimetal shows its potential in active polarization modulation. Here, it is demonstrated that the photonic Weyl semimetal can filter the light with arbitrary required normalized Stokes parameters selected by the magnetic field, namely full&#8208;Stokes magnetic eigen&#8208;modulation scheme, and an analytical relationship between the magnetized direction and eigen polarization state is further derived to guide the modulation scheme. The fractional bandwidth of the modulation scheme is up to 52%. Combined with vectorial holography, an 8&#8208;state reconfigurable metasurface is designed, whose imaging states can be modulated by magnetized direction and experimentally demonstrated in the frequency range from 0.6 to 0.71THz. Furthermore, a single metasurface can function as four switches of the four pairs of orthogonal polarization channels, and the largest contrast ratios of each state are over 18&#160;dB. This multi&#8208;state metasurface scheme provides a novel paradigm to increase the number of functional states, theoretically to infinity, showing promising potential in 6G THz communication and quantum technology.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Engineering for Synergistic Nucleation and Interfacial Regulation Enabling Durable Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a highly sodiophilic and robust Na metal host achieved by spatially confined atomically dispersed Bi sites featuring a unique N3&#8208;Bi&#8208;S1 moiety in interconnected carbon tubes (Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT) has been developed, demonstrating exceptional average Coulombic efficiency, large capacity, and long&#8208;term durability. The mechanisms behind performance enhancement are explicitly revealed by substantial experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are highly promising candidates for low&#8208;cost, sustainable, and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density storage systems. However, their practical deployment is challenged by uncontrolled dendrite growth and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. To address these issues, a highly reversible and robust Na metal host enabled by atomic Bi sites is devised, coordinated in a unique N3&#8208;Bi&#8208;S1 moiety anchored on interconnected carbon tubes (Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT). Crucially, this designed remarkably sodiophilic Bi single&#8208;atom promotes uniform Na nucleation with minimal Na+ consumption, enabling durable and highly reversible Na plating/stripping, while effectively suppressing electrolyte over&#8208;decomposition and fostering the formation of robust inorganic&#8208;rich SEI films, as supported by comprehensive theoretical calculations and experimental analyses. Consequently, Bi&#8208;N3S1@CT achieves an extraordinary average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% over 900 cycles at 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 6 mAh cm&#8722;2, along with long&#8208;term durability of 1000&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 in symmetric cells. Notably, an anode&#8208;free pouch cell paired with a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode exhibits decent cyclability over 240 cycles at 1C while maintaining good rate capability. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to simultaneously enhance energy density and stability in AFSMBs via atomic&#8208;level sodiophilicity regulation and SEI engineering.

Notably, an anode-free pouch cell paired with a high-loading Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cathode exhibits decent cyclability over 240 cycles at 1C while maintaining good rate capability. This work demonstrates a promising strategy to simultaneously enhance energy density and stability in AFSMBs via atomic-level sodiophilicity regulation and SEI engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Highly Robust and Intrinsic Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphenylene Benzodiazole/Liquid Crystal Polyarylate Composites for Flexible Triboelectric Nanogenerators in Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through interface molecular engineering design, intrinsically flame&#8208;retardant and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) based on polyphenylene benzodiazole fabric reinforced liquid crystal polyarylate (PBO/LCP) composites is achieved. The TENG is expected to provide a sustainable pathway for reliable energy sources and sensing for robots in extreme environments.








Abstract
Achieving a power supply for robots operating at high temperatures or in combustion environments is crucial for human life. As an emerging energy collection technique, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) possess great sustainability, however, their electrical output performances rapidly deteriorate due to the failure of polymer based triboelectric layers in harsh environments. Herein, an outstanding high&#8208;temperature resistant and electrically stable TENG is fabricated using composites of polyphenylene benzodiazole (PBO) fiber enhanced liquid crystal polyarylate (LCP). The intrinsic inert PBO fibers are modified by aminated naphthalimide sizing to effectively improve the interfacial interactions of PBO/LCP composites in terms of high tensile strength (409.3 MPa) and storage modulus at 250 &#176;C (0.18 GPa). More importantly, besides good flexibility, high heat resistance index of 303.9&#176;C, and impressive limiting oxygen index of 36.4%, the resultant TENGs showed enhanced electrical output performance at elevated temperature. The output voltage reached 42 V at 200&#176;C, which could drive a louder buzzer compared to the reduced voltages (by 26.5%) at room temperature. Even after burning on the flame for 10 s, the output voltage is almost 100% retained. The findings demonstrate the great potential of interface molecular engineering and structure&#8208;function integrated composites for the wearable electronics of robots in extreme environments.

         <title>Adaptive Co&#8208;Crystals with Switchable Host&#8208;Guest Stoichiometry for Dynamic Regulation of Photoluminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrocycle&#8208;based adaptive co&#8208;crystals with switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry is proposed, enabling vapor&#8208;induced phase transitions, precise D/A ratio modulation, and dynamic TSCT/photoluminescence regulation. Unlike traditional systems, they access intermediate states for fine&#8208;tuned chromic behaviors in the solid state, advancing supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor materials.








Abstract
The development of photoluminescence materials with tunable properties through structural and functional modifications remains a fascinating yet challenging task. In this work, the concept of adaptive co&#8208;crystals featuring switchable host&#8208;guest stoichiometry within the realm of pillararene&#8208;based supramolecular chemistry is proposed. This strategy allows for the rational design of a diverse range of through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer co&#8208;crystals, enabling dynamic modulation of photoluminescence in the solid state. Experimental and theoretical findings unveil two distinct phases within each set of co&#8208;crystal architectures, characterized by different donor/acceptor stoichiometric ratios as well as molecular packing modes. Notably, these co&#8208;crystalline phases undergo vapor&#8208;induced stoichiometry switching and structural interconversion, resulting in unique charge&#8208;transfer transition states and enabling reversible control over photoluminescent behavior. Particularly, this dynamic modulation of the cavity apertures, driven by stoichiometric variation, facilitates highly selective capture and release of 1&#8208;bromoalkane under mild conditions. The present study highlights the potential application of vapor&#8208;mediated co&#8208;crystals with switchable stoichiometry as a supramolecular strategy for modulating the intrinsic characteristics of intermolecular donor&#8211;acceptor materials.

         <title>Disorder Scattering Induced Large Room Temperature Nonlinear Anomalous Hall Effect in a Semiconductor CdGeAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk CdGeAs2, a well&#8208;known nonlinear optical semiconductor, exhibits an exceptionally large room&#8208;temperature nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), achieving a record&#8208;high nonlinear Hall responsivity of 2.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m/V. This pronounced NLHE enables broadband frequency mixing up to the megahertz regime, establishing CdGeAs2 as a promising platform for next&#8208;generation nonlinear electronic and optoelectronic technologies.








Abstract
The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) with time&#8208;reversal symmetry has emerged as a transformative phenomenon within the Hall effect family, attracting significant interest due to its profound implications for both fundamental physics and technological applications. While prior studies have predominantly focused on NLHE in 2D materials, advancements in practical applications have been constrained by low operating temperatures and limited responsivity, typically below 10&#8722;4 m/V. Achieving significant responsivity at room temperature (RT) in 3D systems has proven challenging, particularly for scattering&#8208;induced NLHE. Here, the discovery of disorder scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in chalcopyrite&#8208;type CdGeAs2 bulk single crystals is reported, demonstrating a remarkable responsivity of up to 10&#8722;3 m/V at RT. The studies reveal that NLHE not only facilitates ac&#8208;driven second harmonic and rectification Hall responses but also induces an exceptionally large anomalous Hall angle. Through band structure measurements by ARPES, DFT calculations, as well as symmetry and nonlinear Hall conductivity scaling analyses, disorder scattering is identified as the dominant mechanism for the NLHE in CdGeAs2. Leveraging the observed strong responsivity of NLHE at RT, its broadband electronic frequency mixing capability in the MHz range is further demonstrated. This work sets the foundation for integrating scattering&#8208;induced NLHE in 3D materials into very high&#8208;frequency mixing technologies.

         <title>Control of Covalent Bond Enables Efficient Magnetic Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant and reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is achieved by tuning covalency through sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell chemical engineering, establishing a novel design principle for effective hysteresis control in magnetocaloric materials.








Abstract
Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy&#8208;efficient and climate&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional vapor&#8208;compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials are minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit&#8208;cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3&#8722;Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. This approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range of 40&#8211;160 K. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

         <title>Light&#8208;Up Nanostructures with Allosterically Controlled Fluorogenic DNA Aptamers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By customizing allosteric regulation into fluorescent DNA aptamers, switchable fluorescent nanodevices become achievable. Such a sequence&#8208; and structure&#8208;dependent engineering leads to the realization of clear&#8208;cut fluorescent ON&#8211;OFF switches alongside more advanced operations like Boolean gates and combinatorial circuits. The incorporation of allosteric aptamers with tunable fluorescent properties in DNA nanostructures points a versatile platform of DNA data storage and computing.








Abstract
In this study, a systematic approach is presented for the rational design of synthetic allosteric DNA aptamers. This methodology enables precise control over the allosteric ON&#8211;OFF transition in fluorescent DNA aptamers, allowing for the engineering of aptamers with highly tunable fluorescent properties. When combined with toehold&#8208;mediated strand displacement, a series of allosteric aptamers is developed in which the target sequence functions as a specific allosteric modulator. Furthermore, these aptamers are applied in synthetic DNA computing and in the construction of responsive nanostructures that light up upon activation.

         <title>Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Achieved by Microcapsule Rupture&#8208;Triggered In&#8208;Situ Polymerization for High&#8208;Contrast Damage Visualization and Advanced Anti&#8208;counterfeiting</title>

This study develops a microcapsule rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy for mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. This approach paves the way for the development of self&#8208;healing smart coatings capable of high&#8208;contrast damage visualization, as well as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.








Abstract
Polymer materials with mechano&#8208;responsive ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly desired but challenging to achieve. Herein, a microcapsule (MC) rupture&#8208;triggered in&#8208;situ polymerization strategy is proposed to achieve such RTP with full&#8208;color tunable emissions. It involves co&#8208;encapsulating organic phosphors and moisture&#8208;reactive hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) in MCs, which are dispersed into a polymer matrix. Mechanical damage ruptures MCs, releasing HDI that undergoes moisture&#8208;initiated polymerization to form a rigid cross&#8208;linked network at the damaged site. This network effectively suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay pathways of triplet excitons, thereby activating &#8220;turn&#8208;on&#8221; ultralong RTP signals specifically and exclusively at the damaged sites. The system achieves&#160;ultralong RTP lifetimes exceeding 1.5&#160;s and a phosphorescence quantum yield of 11.2%. Notably, these RTP systems demonstrate&#160;exceptional stability under harsh conditions, including immersing in neutral, acidic, alkaline aqueous environments and various organic solvents, as well as exposure to high temperatures. Full&#8208;color tunable afterglow emissions, ranging from blue to red, are readily achieved by employing different organic phosphors. This approach facilitates the development of self&#8208;repairing smart coatings with high&#8208;contrast damage visualization and advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting systems featuring mechanically activated dynamic RTP responses.&#160;Furthermore, the compatibility of MCs with diverse polymer matrices expands the practical applicability of such stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong RTP materials.

         <title>Electrostatically Enhanced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers Anchoring for Scalable and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a novel electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS). This work employs sulfonamide&#8208;based post&#8208;treatments to modulate the protonation state of phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, resulting in stronger electrostatic interactions with TCO substrates and simultaneously effectively passivating buried interfacial defects, ultimately improving device performance. This scalable and generalizable strategy for advancing PSCs toward industrial standards.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have substantially advanced the efficiency of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet weak interfacial adhesion to transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates and perovskite compromises both scalability and thermal stability. Here, an electrostatically enhanced anchoring strategy (EEAS) is presented using sulfadiazine (SDZ) molecules to deprotonate phosphonic acid groups in SAMs, generating phosphate anions that strengthen electrostatic interactions with the positively charged TCO substrates. The protonated SDZ species concurrently establish strong coordination interactions with the buried perovskite interface. This approach enables the formation of uniform and robust buried interfaces while improving perovskite crystallinity and facilitating charge extraction. The resulting PSCs achieve a certified efficiency of 26.23% (steady&#8208;state 25.42%) over 1 cm2 areas. This EEAS is scalable, enabling 20.7&#8208;cm2 modules with a PCE of 24.72%. The devices demonstrate exceptional operational stability, retaining over 94% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at 65 &#176;C (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2).

         <title>Grain Welding Strategy Suppressing Chemomechanical Failure in Polycrystalline Cathode for High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of particle in polycrystalline O3&#8208;NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode material via introducing Li2CO3 and Na2CO3 eutectics to form liquid phase sintering. The modified cathode suppresses the generation of microcracks and high&#8208;voltage phase transition, impeding chemomechanical failure and achieving high&#8208;voltage fast&#8208;charging sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Chemomechanical failure is critical bottleneck for Na&#8208;based layered oxides (especially polycrystalline material) to achieve the stable operating at high&#8208;voltage with fast&#8208;charging ability. Although attempts like coating and doping are presented to alleviate this issue, the inherent intergranular crevices are inevitable during the synthetic process, which facilitates the chain reaction of chemomechanical failure. Herein, a concept of grain welding strategy is presented to achieve densification of powder particle by introducing liquid phase sintering process, strengthening intergranular adhesion force. The designed polycrystalline NaLi0.05[Ni1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3]0.95O2 shows dense structure attributed to the formation of eutectics which lowers the melting point with fast mass transfer. The Li doping also well manipulates the interlayer properties in unit cell, suppressing the high&#8208;voltage phase transition. Multiple characterizations like cross&#8208;sectional images and synchrotron&#8208;based full&#8208;field transmission X&#8208;ray microscopy confirm that the modified material suppresses the generation of microcracks during electrochemical cycles, impeding the chemomechanical breakdown. Consequently, it shows advanced capacity of 152.8 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent fast charging capability (121.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;C, 12&#160;min), as well as long&#8208;life of 1000 cycles.

The method enables in &#8208; situ curing within seconds, drastically reducing energy consumption.

Abstract
Thermoset composites often face a challenging trade&#8208;off between recyclability and high performance. In this study, an innovative closed&#8208;loop manufacturing approach that integrates frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) with 3D printing to produce fully recyclable carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (c&#8208;CFRPs) is presented. A self&#8208;propagating FROMP&#8208;enabled direct ink writing (DIW) printing technology is developed, enabling in situ curing within seconds. This breakthrough eliminates the need for post&#8208;processing and reduces energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional autoclave methods. By copolymerizing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) with a commercial spiroacetal monomer&#160;(&#8804;3&#160;wt.%), acid&#8208;degradable resins that retain the tensile strength of conventional thermosets are introduced&#160;while allowing for matrix depolymerization under mild conditions. The DCPD&#8208;based c&#8208;CFRPs demonstrate remarkable tensile strengths of up to 817&#160;MPa and glass transition temperatures exceeding 160&#160;&#176;C. In a significant advancement, the recovered carbon fibers retain their pristine morphology and over 95% of their original mechanical properties, enabling repeated recycling without performance loss. Additionally, recovered oligomers can be repolymerized into new resins, further enhancing sustainability. This work presents a groundbreaking solution for high&#8208;performance composite manufacturing, addressing critical energy and waste challenges in the thermoset industry.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Design and Discovery of High&#8208;Performance Cyanine&#8208;Based Photosensitizers for Integrated Theranostic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted framework integrating quantum&#8208;chemical and RDKit descriptors enables accurate prediction and two&#8208;stage screening of cyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers. This strategy bridges computation and experiment, efficiently identifying and synthesizing high&#8208;performance theranostic agents with superior singlet oxygen generation and fluorescence properties, providing a rational and generalizable path toward next&#8208;generation PDT photosensitizer design.








Abstract
Cyanine&#8208;based photosensitizers are attractive for photodynamic therapy (PDT) owing to their excellent near&#8208;infrared absorption and fluorescence. However, the low singlet oxygen quantum yield (&#934;&#916;) and structural optimization challenges hinder their further development. In this study, a machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted molecular design framework based on the currently available dataset of cyanine molecules is provided. By integrating RDKit structural descriptors with quantum chemical descriptors, hybrid feature&#8208;based predictive models that accurately predict the &#934;&#916; and fluorescence quantum yield (&#934;F) of cyanine derivatives (R2 &gt;0.9) have been constructed for the first time. Based on this, a two&#8208;stage virtual screening strategy is developed to efficiently identify promising cyanine derivatives from a library of 2835 candidate structures. Three representative molecules are synthesized as proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept validation, confirming the predictive reliability and practical utility of the ML&#8208;guided workflow. The lead compound 1775 exhibits the highest performance (&#934;&#916; = 0.62) and performs well in cellular assays, supporting the robustness and applicability of the ML&#8208;assisted screening strategy in guiding experimental validation. This work establishes a data&#8208;driven paradigm bridging molecular modeling and experimental verification, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for the rational design and rapid evaluation of high&#8208;performance cyanine&#8208;based theranostic agents.

         <title>Akkermansia Muciniphila&#8208;Inspired Oral siRNA Delivery by Active Matrix&#8208;Penetration and Intracellular Endoplasmic Reticulum Accumulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural oral nucleic acid delivery system inspired by Akkermansia muciniphila is developed, which efficiently penetrates the intestinal mucus by degrading mucins and targets the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via Golgi apparatus&#8211;ER transport. This enables effective PD&#8208;L1 silencing and immune checkpoint blockade therapy for colorectal cancer.









Abstract
Oral delivery of small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)&#160;is highly challenging due to the multiple barriers present in the gastrointestinal tract and within cells. Herein, inspired by intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila, the use of Akkermansia muciniphila membrane vesicles (AMVs) is introduced as an effective tool for oral delivery of siRNA. It is revealed that, distinct from common passive mucus&#8208;penetrating nanoparticles, AMVs enable active mucus penetration by degrading intestinal mucins, thereby enhancing their ability to traverse the intestinal barrier by approximately 4.6 times. Additionally, AMVs can markedly heighten siRNA penetration into tumor tissues. Once inside tumor cells, AMVs bypass the traditional endosomal&#8208;lysosomal degradation pathway typical of lipid&#8208;based delivery systems. Instead, they utilize a rapid transport expressway from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), facilitating the accumulation of siRNA within the ER and thereby markedly enhancing gene silencing efficiency. In a mouse model of colorectal cancer, this formulation effectively inhibits tumor growth by 91.6%, and it exhibits a favorable biosafety profile. Overall, this research unveils a unique and promising bioinspired platform for oral siRNA delivery, advancing the development of safe and efficient oral nucleic acid therapeutics.

         <title>Bioinspired Janus Spider&#8208;Web Nanofibrous Membranes Integrating Triboelectric Energy Harvesting, Adaptive Thermo&#8208;Moisture Regulation, and Bactericidal Activity for Multifunctional Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spider&#8208;web&#8208;inspired Janus ferroelectric nanofibrous membrane integrates asymmetric wettability, high porosity, and robust flexibility. The membrane achieves self&#8208;powered thermo&#8208;moisture regulation, enhanced water transport, and antibacterial protection, demonstrating stable triboelectric output and multifunctional adaptability for wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring, and smart protective textiles.








Abstract
The development of multifunctional membranes integrating asymmetric wettability, breathable waterproofing, antibacterial activity, and energy&#8208;harvesting capabilities is critical for smart textiles and medical protective equipment, yet balancing robustness, environmental adaptability, and energy conversion efficiency remains challenging. Here, we engineer a bioinspired Janus nanofibrous membrane with a spider&#8208;web&#8208;like hierarchical architecture via synchronous electrospinning&#8208;electrospraying of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) and polyamide 6 (PA6). This design achieves dual&#8208;scale wettability (hydrophobic/hydrophilic asymmetry), 83.6% porosity, and mechanical durability (99% structural integrity after 2000 bends). It enables intelligent environmental regulation (7.4 &#8451; thermal gradient under 1 kW/m&#178; solar irradiation), while the electric&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced design accelerates water transport by 20% vs. passive diffusion. Its triboelectric performance surpasses existing breathable membranes (177.5 V open&#8208;circuit voltage, 0.63 W/m2 power density, stable output over 10,000 cycles), enabling encrypted Morse&#8208;code communication for programmable human&#8208;machine interaction. The hierarchical structure exhibits exceptional antibacterial efficacy: 99.92% against Escherichia coli (E. coli), 100% against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and 95% against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Via a scalable, low&#8208;cost process compatible with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll manufacturing, this approach holds promise for industrial integration in next&#8208;generation wearable healthcare and protection systems.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Rivalling Large&#8208;Area Flexible Broadband Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sensitive large&#8208;area flexible organic photodetector, based on a cyano&#8208;substituted electron acceptor, has been obtained. It is fully comparable to the commercially available silicon photodiodes in multiple aspects, including detection range, responsivity, and detectivity. The demonstration of various applications in different scenarios and the development of large&#8208;area flexible devices highlight the unique advantages and commercialization prospects of the organic photodetectors. 








Abstract
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have demonstrated significant advantages as a promising next&#8208;generation photodetection technology, especially for application in flexible and curved image sensing. However, there is still a big gap in device performance between OPDs and commercial silicon photodiodes, which hinders their practical application. Herein, using a novel near&#8208;infrared electron acceptor featuring acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor molecular skeleton and electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;substituted terminal groups, the study reports an OPD that can fully compete with the commercial silicon photodiodes. Benefiting from the strong electron push&#8208;pull effect and large molecular dipole moment, the OPD exhibits a broad detection range from 300 to 1100&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency of 70% at 940&#160;nm. Moreover, owing to the reduced energetic disorder and trap density, the OPD exhibits a picoampere&#8208;level dark current density (1.30 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2) at &#8211;0.1&#160;V bias. Such high responsivity and low dark current density endow the OPD with a detectivity surpassing 1013 Jones across the whole spectral range. More importantly, this superior photodetection performance can be maintained in large&#8208;area flexible device (80 mm2).

     alt="Silicon-Rivalling Large-Area Flexible Broadband Organic Photodetectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sensitive large-area flexible organic photodetector, based on a cyano-substituted electron acceptor, has been obtained. It is fully comparable to the commercially available silicon photodiodes in multiple aspects, including detection range, responsivity, and detectivity. The demonstration of various applications in different scenarios and the development of large-area flexible devices highlight the unique advantages and commercialization prospects of the organic photodetectors. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have demonstrated significant advantages as a promising next-generation photodetection technology, especially for application in flexible and curved image sensing. However, there is still a big gap in device performance between OPDs and commercial silicon photodiodes, which hinders their practical application. Herein, using a novel near-infrared electron acceptor featuring acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor molecular skeleton and electron-withdrawing cyano-substituted terminal groups, the study reports an OPD that can fully compete with the commercial silicon photodiodes. Benefiting from the strong electron push-pull effect and large molecular dipole moment, the OPD exhibits a broad detection range from 300 to 1100&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency of 70% at 940&#160;nm. Moreover, owing to the reduced energetic disorder and trap density, the OPD exhibits a picoampere-level dark current density (1.30 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;10&lt;/sup&gt; A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at &#8211;0.1&#160;V bias. Such high responsivity and low dark current density endow the OPD with a detectivity surpassing 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones across the whole spectral range. More importantly, this superior photodetection performance can be maintained in large-area flexible device (80 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These results demonstrate the huge potential of OPDs in addressing the limitations of silicon photodiodes for application in flexible and wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Concentration Antibody Formulation via Solvent&#8208;Based Dehydration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous solid antibodies are encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles through a solvent&#8208;based dehydration process. The solvent extracts water from antibody solution droplets, causing the antibody to concentrate, and precipitation of the antibody into amorphous solid is induced. The particles are resuspended into aqueous solution in which they are injectable for subcutaneous delivery at high concentrations.








Abstract
Although subcutaneous (SC) delivery is the preferred administration route for immunotherapies and other biologics for improved patient compliance and lower healthcare costs, it necessitates high&#8208;concentration antibody formulations. However, high&#8208;concentration antibody solutions face significant instabilities and prohibitively high viscosities. Other approaches for high&#8208;concentration formulations have been developed, including non&#8208;aqueous solutions, which can be irritating or painful, and antibody&#8208;laden hydrogel microparticles, which require centrifugation and are limited to concentrations &lt;300 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. This work presents a new formulation process wherein the antibody is concentrated and encapsulated into hydrogel microparticles via solvent&#8208;based dehydration. The final dosage form is an aqueous particle suspension with a formulation concentration of 360 mg&#160;mL&#8722;1. In this process, microparticles are synthesized continuously, and antibody precipitation is realized simultaneously to dehydration, which allows for higher antibody concentrations. Antibody phase behavior and precipitation&#8211;dehydration kinetics are analyzed. The antibody is structurally and functionally stable in the microparticle post&#8208;processing and after 4 months. Injectability of the suspension meets clinical standards with glide force &lt;20 N. For the first time, an aqueous antibody formulation at high concentrations comparable to non&#8208;aqueous formulations is presented, ideal for subcutaneous administration. The process is envisioned to be generalizable as a platform for SC delivery in multiple clinical&#160;applications.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Stable NIR Nanolasing: Monolithic Integration of PbS CQDs on a Silicon Photonic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared nanolaser is experimentally demonstrated using a high&#8208;Q cavity and Zn&#8208;doped PbS cQDs. The cavity design, cQD performance, and device behavior under fs/ps pumping are systematically studied, achieving the lowest threshold and narrowest linewidth for NIR nanolasers under fs excitation. CW pumping reveals cavity&#8208;enhanced emission across E, S, C, and L telecommunication bands, exhibiting excellent thermal and long&#8208;term stability.








Abstract
Nanolasers based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), while transformative in the visible spectrum, face critical roadblocks in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regime due to material instability under ambient conditions and ultrafast Auger recombination in large NIR CQDs. Here, these limitations are addressed through zinc&#8208;doped PbS CQDs that suppress nonradiative decay, integrated with compact high&#8208;Q silicon nanobeam cavities to leverage the Purcell effect for efficiently guiding spontaneous emission into laser modes, thereby significantly reducing the threshold power. This work demonstrates a monolithic CQD&#8208;integrated silicon photonic platform that achieves NIR lasing under pulsed optical pumping, featuring a record narrow linewidth of 0.29 nm (0.15 meV) at 1579.20 nm and an ultralow threshold of 127 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Notably, under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) pumping, the device exhibits cavity&#8208;filtered spontaneous emission with a sub&#8208;nanometer linewidth across the 1350&#8211;1600 nm spectrum. This emission showcases &lt;6% peak power decay over 15 h at 300 K, robust performance up to 360 K, and negligible degradation after 250 days of ambient storage. By monolithically integrating solution&#8208;processed CQDs with CMOS&#8208;compatible silicon photonics, this platform establishes a reliable, scalable, and low&#8208;cost route toward multiwavelength on&#8208;chip nanolaser arrays in the NIR regime, unlocking transformative potential for compact photonic technologies in imaging, sensing, and communications.

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Limiting Presodiation Inducing Homogeneous Inorganic&#8211;Organic Polymer&#8208;Skeleton Interphases for Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermodynamically self&#8208;limiting chemical presodiation is proposed by synergistically integrating sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), which is applicable to diverse cathodes, offering a practical route to advance sodium&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
Cathode&#8208;side chemical presodiation is a promising route to compensate for initial sodium loss in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, conventional presodiated cathodes are prone to oversodiation, structural degradation, and consequent cycling instability under excessive thermodynamic impetus, necessitating stringent control over presodiation duration and thereby limiting their universality and practicality. Here, a universal and thermodynamically self&#8208;limiting chemical presodiation is proposed by synergistically integrating sodium diphenyl ketone (Na&#8208;DK) with fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). Specifically, Na&#8208;DK enables controllable and self&#8208;limiting sodium insertion beyond the stability potential threshold of presodiated cathodes due to diminishing thermodynamic driving force, effectively preventing oversodiation while eliminating the requirement for strict presodiation time control. Simultaneously, Na&#8208;DK initiates a radical&#8208;mediated decomposition of FEC to form homogeneous inorganic&#8211;organic polymer&#8208;skeleton cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphases (CEIs) with enhanced mechanical robustness, surpassing conventional PVDF&#8208;derived heterogeneous inorganic&#8208;rich CEIs. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiments confirm that when applied to the widely used Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode, this strategy delivers exceptional cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 2000 cycles (4000 h) at 1 C and 92.3% after 5000 cycles at 10 C, among the best performances. Full cells exhibit over twofold capacity enhancement and markedly extended cycle life compared to commercial counterparts. More importantly, this strategy is successfully extended to other cathode chemistries (e.g., Na4Fe3(PO4)2P2O7), demonstrating its broad applicability.

         <title>Selective Growth of Ferroelectric Ultrathin Nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precursor&#8208;guided CVD method is developed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form structure. &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 are synthesized using different precursors. Ex situ STEM reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, highlighting the potential of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 for next&#8208;generation polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.








Abstract
Indium selenide (In2Se3) has received increasing interest due to its diverse polytypes and associated polytype&#8208;dependent ferroelectric properties, making it one of the promising platforms guiding the development of ultrathin ferroelectric nanodevices. To date, &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#946;'&#8208;phase In2Se3 have been well studied, but nonlayered &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 remains underexplored because of sophisticated formation paths and minor energy differences with other phases. Therefore, understanding the growth mechanisms and electronic structures of &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 is crucial to present the full roadmap of the InxSey family. Herein, a precursor&#8208;guided chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is proposed to selectively grow ultrathin &#947;&#8208;In2Se3 crystals with a nonlayered, vacancy&#8208;ordered screw form (VOSF) structure. The sublimation temperature of precursors plays a critical role in selectively synthesizing &#945;&#8208;, &#946;&#8208;, and &#947;&#8208;phase In2Se3 using different precursors (In2Se3, In2O3, InCl3). Ex situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveals a &#947;&#8208;In2Se3&#8208;to&#8208;InSe phase transition at 600&#160;&#176;C, consecutively triggered by interlayer bonds broken, vacancy reorganization and removal of Se atoms. Away from existing literature, only out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, driven by vertical off&#8208;center displacements of Se atoms, is detected. Therefore, a full spectrum of In2Se3&#8217;s polytypes, particularly nonlayered ferroelectric &#947;&#8208;In2Se3, is selectively obtained, presenting great potential for next&#8208;generation In2Se3&#8208;based polytypes&#8208;dependent nanoelectromechanical and memory devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indium selenide (In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has received increasing interest due to its diverse polytypes and associated polytype-dependent ferroelectric properties, making it one of the promising platforms guiding the development of ultrathin ferroelectric nanodevices. To date, &#945;-, &#946;-, and &#946;'-phase In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; have been well studied, but nonlayered &#947;-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; remains underexplored because of sophisticated formation paths and minor energy differences with other phases. Therefore, understanding the growth mechanisms and electronic structures of &#947;-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is crucial to present the full roadmap of the In&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; family.

         <title>Flow&#8208;Regime&#8208;Controlled Fabrication of CNT&#8208;Bridged Vertically Aligned rGO/MXene Fibers for High&#8208;Performance Fiber Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs) are fabricated by flow&#8208;driven wet spinning strategy with precisely regulated flow regimes. The vertical aligned 2D nanosheets are interconnected by CNT, forming continuous conductive networks for fluent ion accumulation and fast electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the energy storage performance.








Abstract
The directional construction of electrode frameworks aligned with the transport pathways of ions/electron is critical for electrochemical processes. However, conventional fabrication strategies suffer from bottlenecks such as complex processes, and difficulty in scaling up production. In this work, a flow&#8208;driven wet&#8208;spinning strategy is developed to fabricate carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;bridged vertically aligned reduced graphene oxide (rGO)/MXene fibers (CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMFs). Enabled by precisely regulating of flow regimes, the vertical aligned rGO/MXene nanosheets and CNT&#8208;bridged structure collaboratively establish open porous channels for rapid ion transport, continuous conductive networks for efficient electron transfer, and abundant accessible active sites for enhanced charge storage. Consequently, the CNT&#8208;VA&#8208;GMF electrode exhibits improved ion transport, exceptional specific capacitance (740 F g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability (98% retention after 30&#160;000 cycles) in H2SO4 electrolyte. The assembled flexible asymmetric supercapacitor achieves a remarkable energy density of 224&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (at 1200&#160;W kg&#8722;1) while maintaining robust mechanical flexibility.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Co&#8208;Delivery of T&#8208;Cell Antigen and Camptothecin Guided by Cascade&#8208;Responsive Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly to Reshape Tumor Antigenicity for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade&#8208;responsive peptide self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed for co&#8208;delivering camptothecin and T&#8208;cell antigen to tumors. The approach successfully reshapes tumor antigenicity by efficiently endowing tumor cells with exogenous peptide antigens through the intracellular class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC&#8208;I)&#8208;associated antigen presentation pathway. When combined with the adoptive transfer of CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint blockade, our strategy effectively inhibits tumor growth.








Abstract
Antigen presentation deficiency restricted by class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC&#8208;I) causes low antigenicity and antigen escape in tumors, thereby limiting T&#8208;cell immunotherapy outcomes. Here, a combined tumor immunotherapy is developed, in which tumors can present exogenous non&#8208;tumor antigens, and adoptively transferred CD8+ T cells specific for these antigens are re&#8208;targeted to attack tumors. The approach leverages a cascade&#8208;responsive peptide self&#8208;assembly to co&#8208;deliver suitable antigens and the chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin (CPT) to tumors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, to re&#8208;target ovalbumin (OVA)&#8208;specific OT&#8208;I CD8+ T cells against tumors, PSA (Nap&#8208;GFFpYE&#8208;ss&#8208;Ag) and CPSA (CPT&#8208;GFFpYE&#8208;ss&#8208;Ag) are constructed, containing an OVA&#8208;derived epitope OVA257&#8208;264 and/or CPT. The design enables the release of a unique N&#8208;terminal extended OVA257&#8208;264 and CPT into the cytosol. As a result, the extended antigen is efficiently presented on the tumor surface by MHC&#8208;I, and CPT further enhances this presentation. When combined with adoptively transferred OT&#8208;I CD8+ T cells, the approach effectively facilitates CD8+ T cell infiltration and tumor inhibition. Additionally, CPSA treatment sensitizes immune responses to programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) blockade, allowing the approach to synergize with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody for improved tumor eradication.

         <title>Three&#8208;Phase Interfacial Force Regulated Solid&#8208;Like Liquid&#8208;Slider for Highly Efficient and Robust Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator is proposed, which enables stable operation of patterned liquid as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical by regulating three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, demonstrating remarkable long&#8208;term durability and a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%.








Abstract
Conventional sliding mode triboelectric nanogenerators convert low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy into electricity through relative motion between solid&#8208;solid tribo&#8208;layers. However, the inherent trade&#8208;off between maintaining close contact and mitigating interfacial friction hinders the device's energy conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a solid&#8208;like liquid&#8208;slider triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) is proposed, where milliliter&#8208;scale liquid motion is precisely governed by a liquid&#8208;driver consisting of a hydrophilic interface enclosed by a hydrophobic boundary. By theoretical analysis and experimental regulation of solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas three&#8208;phase interfacial forces, stable operation of the liquid&#8208;slider with a designed pattern is realized as the tilt angle varies from horizontal to vertical. Benefiting from the shape&#8208;adaptivity and ultra&#8208;smooth properties of the liquid, a palm&#8208;sized LS&#8208;TENG outputs 2856 &#181;J of energy per cycle with an average torque of just 0.73 mN&#183;m at 30&#160;rpm, achieving a record&#8208;high energy conversion efficiency of 63.47%. The optimized friction during solid&#8208;liquid dynamic interactions ensures the excellent stability of LS&#8208;TENG over six months of continuous operation. Moreover, the encapsulated LS&#8208;TENG autonomously initiates under a 1.3 m&#160;s&#8722;1 breeze, powering 960 series&#8208;connected green LEDs and enabling wireless wind speed monitoring. The regulation of three&#8208;phase interfacial forces in solid&#8208;liquid TENG provides a feasible path for efficient and reliable mechanical energy harvesting.

         <title>Multiply Nano&#8208;Twinned Copper as a &#8220;Dual&#8208;Site Cooperative&#8221; Catalyst for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study prepares Multiply Nano&#8208;Twinned Copper (MNTs&#8208;Cu) via a &#8220;dual nonequilibrium&#8221; strategy. As a &#8220;dual&#8208;site cooperative&#8221; catalyst, it enhances NIRR performance, achieving a high NH3 yield of 112.03&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.7&#160;V vs RHE, and notably, it can continuously maintain a high FENH3 of &gt;99% within the high potential range, offering insights for H*&#8208;involved reactions.








Abstract
To advance the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NIRR) to ammonia, it is essential to rationally regulate the kinetics of active hydrogen (H*). Nevertheless, an in&#8208;depth understanding of H* generation, transfer, and utilization remains elusive, which impedes exploring strategies for optimizing H* dynamics. In this study, a copper nanocrystalline is developed with a multiply nano&#8208;twinned structure (MNTs&#8208;Cu) using a &#8220;dual nonequilibrium&#8221; strategy to optimize H* dynamics and enhance NIRR performance. Experimental and theoretical studies show that MNTs&#8208;Cu functions as a &#8220;dual&#8208;site cooperative&#8221; catalyst, addressing the H* supply&#8208;consumption balance to boost ammonia electrosynthesis. Specifically, the Cu sites are responsible for the activation of nitrate, while the nano&#8208;twinned structure serves as an &#8220;active hydrogen hub&#8221; to facilitate the generation, transfer, and utilization of H*. The MNTs&#8208;Cu catalyst achieves a high NH3 yield of 112.03&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.7&#160;V vs RHE, and notably, it can continuously maintain a high FENH3 of &gt;99% within the high potential range from &#8722;0.7 to &#8722;0.9&#160;V vs RHE. This work provides a novel pathway for optimizing H* behavior through structural engineering, offering insights for advancing NIRR and other hydrogenation reactions.

         <title>Programmable Photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Triggered by a Temperature&#8208;Adaptation Spin Polarization Electron Pump</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a temperature&#8208;adaptation spin polarization electron pump that enables directional electron transfer and suppresses charge recombination. The injected spin polarization electrons stabilize CO* intermediates and promote their hydrogenation toward CH4, achieving reversible product selectivity and enhanced CO2 photoreduction efficiency.








Abstract
Selective control of CO2 photoreduction toward CO or CH4 is essential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion. Reversible switching between these two products remains challenging because conventional photocatalysts cannot adjust charge behavior with temperature, and polar intermediates are insufficiently stabilized. A temperature&#8208;adaptation photocatalytic platform that acts as a spin polarization electron pump, delivering programmable interfacial electron injection and dynamically steering CO2 reduction pathways in real time is reported. At low temperature, adaptive modulation increases interfacial electron accumulation at the reaction interface, extending the lifetime and reactivity of deep&#8208;pathway intermediates without altering catalyst composition. Consequently, product selectivity reversibly shifts from CO at high temperature to CH4 at low temperature, enabling controlled access to either shallow or deep reduction products under reliably well&#8208;defined thermal conditions. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance demonstrate enhanced spin polarization and reduced charge recombination upon cooling, consistent with stronger interfacial electron retention. In situ infrared spectroscopy and ab initio molecular dynamics reveal that spin polarization&#8208;selective transfer bends CO2 and induces C&#9472;O bond asymmetry, which facilitates CHO* formation and lowers the barrier for CO* hydrogenation to CH4. Collectively, these findings establish a generalizable strategy that integrates spin polarization with temperature responsiveness to realize dynamically programmable product selectivity in solar&#8208;driven CO2 conversion.

         <title>Mass Diffusion&#8208;Dominated Phase Separation Enabling On&#8208;Demand and Repeatable Lifetime Programming of Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Polymer Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) polymer hydrogels with programmable lifetimes are designed via mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation. Their lifetimes are tunable from 9.1 to 130.8 ms by varying heating time (0&#8211;60 min), and repeatable RTP is achieved under heating/cooling cycles. These hydrogels serve as rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting platforms for time&#8208;dependent information display.








Abstract
Current luminescent polymer hydrogels rely primarily on tunable emission intensities/colors. Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels with on&#8208;demand programmable lifetimes, albeit long envisaged, have never been achieved, but such RTP hydrogels will provide another lifetime dimension to enrich the family of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials for broadening their emerging applications. Herein, the mass diffusion&#8208;dominated phase separation strategy is proposed to develop the first RTP polymer hydrogels, whose lifetime can be continuously programmed from 9.1 to 130.8&#160;ms. Upon heating at 90 &#176;C, cooperative coordination and hydrophobic interactions in hydrogels induce a dense/sparse polymer phase separation, leading to controllable rubbery&#8208;to&#8208;glassy transition with 154&#8208;fold enhancement in Young's modulus, thereby efficiently restricting molecular vibrations and stabilizing triplet excitons. Note that the hydrogels&#8217; RTP performance is essentially not controlled by heat transport but is dominated by phase&#8208;separation kinetics, therefore their lifetimes can be widely programmed by merely manipulating the heating duration. Further natural cooling at 25&#160;&#176;C makes polymer phase re&#8208;fusion to recover the rubbery state, enabling the repeatable RTP lifetime programming. Based on these findings, rewritable spatiotemporal&#8208;resolved information decryption platform with time&#8208;dependent security is demonstrated. This study opens new avenues of RTP hydrogels by demonstrating the unprecedented lifetime&#8208;programming capacity and enriches the intelligence of luminescent materials.

         <title>Unique Dual&#8208;Affinity Strategy for Specific Lipopolysaccharide Clearance in Sepsis Therapy: Peptide&#8208;Conjugated Molecularly Imprinted Polymers via Emulsion Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the challenge of achieving specific LPS clearance in sepsis, a dual&#8208;affinity adsorbent (PS@PA&#8208;PHK+) is developed that converges the high binding affinity of peptides with the shape&#8208;selective recognition capability of molecularly imprinted polymers. PS@PA&#8208;PHK+ demonstrates high specificity, broad&#8208;spectrum selectivity toward diverse LPS types, and strong adsorption capacity, representing the key features of a new generation of hemoperfusion materials.








Abstract
Sepsis is an infection&#8208;induced organ dysfunction with high global morbidity and mortality. Specific clearance of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), key pathological drivers in sepsis, from the bloodstream is critical for effective therapy. However, selective capture of LPS is challenging due to their structural heterogeneity, extremely low concentrations (ng&#183;mL&#8722;1), and complexity of blood components. Here, a novel dual&#8208;affinity strategy is presented for designing high&#8208;specificity LPS adsorbents. Leveraging phage display, a high&#8208;affinity peptide ligand (P&#8208;HK) targeting the LPS family is identified by screening against their conserved Kdo2&#8208;Lipid A structure. Concurrently, delicate molecularly imprinted polymers (PS@PA+) with geometrically matched cavities are synthesized via emulsion interfacial polymerization, exploiting the oriented assembly of amphiphilic LPS templates at oil&#8208;water interfaces. Conjugation of the imprinted polymers with the peptide ligand produced PS@PA&#8208;PHK+, which exhibits highly specific LPS binding and demonstrates exceptional performance, including remarkable E. coli LPS clearance efficiency (99.2% in buffer; 95.4% in blood), high adsorption capacity (543 EU&#183;mg&#8722;1), broad&#8208;spectrum clearance of diverse bacterial LPSs, robust anti&#8208;fouling properties, and satisfactory biocompatibility. Furthermore, PS@PA&#8208;PHK+&#8208;based hemoperfusion in a septic rabbit model confirmed significant therapeutic efficacy, remarkably reducing circulating LPS levels and mitigating organ damage. This material design overcomes the challenge of specific LPS clearance, offering substantial promise for transformative sepsis therapy.

         <title>Integrated Hollow Microfibers of Covalent Organic Framework on Cu Foil as a Gradient Zn Metal Anode Host for Bottom&#8208;Up Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic framework on Cu foil (HMCOF&#8208;Cu) is designed as a gradient host for Zn metal anode. Owing to the carbonyl groups in the surface HMCOF layer and hierarchical pores, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host presents rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+, fast Zn2+ ions diffusion and reduced volume change for bottom&#8208;up Zn deposition without dendrite.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous Zn metal batteries are promising choices for future grid&#8208;scale energy storage because of cost&#8208;effectiveness, high&#8208;rate performance and safety. Nonetheless, the sluggish desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ ions usually leads to uncontrolled Zn dendrite growth and detrimental side reactions on Zn metal anodes (ZMAs). Herein, we report the formation of integrated hollow microfibers of covalent organic frameworks on Cu foil (denoted as HMCOF&#8208;Cu) as a ZMA host with gradient design. Of note, interactions between carbonyl groups of HMCOF and H2O in [Zn(H2O)6]2+ promote rapid desolvation of hydrated Zn2+. Besides, 3D&#160;HMCOF network can accelerate Zn2+ diffusion and accommodate the volumetric deformation during the deposition/stripping cycles. Moreover, the gradient design can induce bottom&#8208;up deposition for dendrite&#8208;free ZMA. As a result, the HMCOF&#8208;Cu host enables stable Zn plating/stripping processes over 2500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cell based on HMCOF&#8208;Cu@Zn anode presents a long&#8208;term stability over 7000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1.

         <title>Dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site Strategy Underpins Stable Unimodal Deep&#8208;Blue Emitting Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;B&#8208;Site strategy is innovatively proposed to underpin stable unimodal deep&#8208;blue perovskite emission. The new approach suppresses phase segregation and eliminates green emission in blue perovskite emitters by controlling energy transfer dynamics. This study provides the first mechanistic explanation of this process and offers a universal design rule to prevent spectral instability in single&#8208;halide blue perovskite emitters.








Abstract
The operational stability of mixed&#8208;halide blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is fundamentally constrained by intrinsic halide ion migration. Employing single&#8208;halide perovskite systems represents a viable route to circumvent this issue, yet solution&#8208;processed pure&#8208;bromide perovskites typically exhibit undesirable green emission, impeding attainment of high&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue electroluminescence. Herein, this challenge is addressed through the strategic incorporation of Mg2+ into the B&#8208;site of the pure bromine&#8208;based perovskite lattice. This substitution induces a substantial spectral blueshift and promotes phase homogenization by facilitating efficient energy transfer from small&#8208;n to large&#8208;n phases. Notably, the first systematic investigation and mechanistic elucidation of the origin of bimodal emission in blue PeLEDs is presented. Consequently, the champion PeLED delivers stable deep&#8208;blue emission at 464&#160;nm with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 4.76%. This study presents a definitive paradigm for achieving spectrally stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission from single&#8208;halide perovskites. The elucidated mechanism underlying emission bimodality provides critical guidance for future development of blue PeLEDs.

         <title>Dual Vacancy&#8208;Driven &#8220;Lattice Softening&#8221; NiFeAlx LDHs for High&#8208;Rate and Durable Chloride Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a mild room&#8208;temperature etching strategy, rational construction of dual&#8208;vacancy domains and multidimensional ion pathways is realized in NiFeAlx layered double hydroxide cathodes. The vacancy&#8208;rich, lattice&#8208;softened framework enables elastic strain accommodation and rapid Cl&#8722; diffusion, delivering unprecedented cycling stability and high&#8208;rate performance beyond previously reported chloride&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Defect engineering becomes an essential strategy for enhancing electrochemical performance, yet its application in anion&#8208;based systems such as chloride&#8208;ion batteries (CIBs) remains largely unexplored. Herein, a rational defect&#8208;engineering strategy is developed to overcome these bottlenecks by constructing dual&#8208;vacancy NiFeAlx layered double hydroxides (LDHs) featuring coexisting cationic and oxygen vacancies, achieved via a room&#8208;temperature alkaline etching process that selectively leaches Al3+ while retaining layered integrity. The optimized NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH exhibits unprecedented &#8220;lattice softening&#8221; behavior, enabling elastic deformation and dynamic structural reconstruction to accommodate volumetric fluctuations during Cl&#8208;intercalation/de&#8208;intercalation. Benefiting from this defect&#8208;induced structural flexibility, the electrode delivers a high reversible capacity of 101.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, along with the Coulombic efficiency of 99.91%. Multiscale mechanistic analyses demonstrate that the coupled vacancies regulate local electronic distribution and coordination environments while simultaneously imparting pronounced lattice softening and structural elasticity to the NiFeAl0.04&#8208;24h&#8208;Cl LDH, thereby facilitating enhanced Cl&#8722; ion accommodation. Furthermore, the vacancies construct interconnected 3D ion highways, which dramatically accelerate Cl&#8722; diffusion, enhance interfacial adsorption kinetics, and minimize charge&#8208;transfer resistance. Such lattice&#8208;adaptive regulation resolves the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;off between anion&#8208;storage capacity and structural stability in LDH&#8208;based systems, offering a promising strategy for designing efficient anion&#8208;hosting electrodes for advanced CIB systems.

         <title>Unraveling In&#8208;Plane Crystallographic Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Memory Performance In Van Der Waals &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 Ferroelectric Semiconductor Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the in&#8208;plane crystallographic anisotropy of the two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals ferroelectric semiconductor &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 is a critical determinant of ferroelectric switching dynamics and memory performance. Our results reveal orientation&#8208;dependent transport pathways, Schottky barrier modulation, and electrostatic potential energy that dictate polarization reversal and synaptic functionality.








Abstract
The ferroelectric semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (FeS&#8208;FETs) based on &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 emerge as promising non&#8208;volatile memory devices. However, the intrinsic in&#8208;plane (IP) crystallographic anisotropy of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 introduces orientation dependence, leading to pronounced variations in memory performance depending on the IP alignment of the source/drain (S/D) contacts. This study presents the first demonstration of IP anisotropy&#8208;dependent ferroelectricity in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 FeS&#8208;FETs with S/D contacts aligned along the armchair (AC) and zigzag (ZZ) directions. The AC&#8208;aligned S/D configuration achieves a ferroelectric resistance switching (FRS) ratio of 6.42, an on/off current ratio of 4.53 &#215; 104, and a normalized memory window (MW) of 59 %, whereas the ZZ&#8208;aligned counterpart exhibits an FRS ratio of 1.05, an on/off ratio of 5.25, and negligible MW. The electron transports proceed through twisted pathways along the AC direction, but proceed along a straight trajectory in the ZZ direction to avoid high&#8208;energy barrier regions due to the threefold rotational symmetric lattice. Thus, the excessive electron transmission and a reduced Schottky barrier height effectively screen the influence of ferroelectric bound charges in the ZZ&#8208;aligned S/D contacts. These findings establish clear correlations between IP anisotropy and the ferroelectric functionality of &#945;&#8208;In2Se3, offering critical guidelines for the design of FeS&#8208;FETs.

These findings establish clear correlations between IP anisotropy and the ferroelectric functionality of &#945;-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, offering critical guidelines for the design of FeS-FETs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Chain&#8208;Length&#8208;Selective Intermolecular Charge&#8208;Transfer Regulation via Competitive and Cooperative Pathways in Solid&#8208;State Macrocyclic Host&#8211;Guest Systems</title>

A dual&#8208;mode macrocyclic host&#8211;guest approach enables chain&#8208;length&#8208;selective modulation of solid&#8208;state charge&#8208;transfer interactions via competitive and cooperative pathways, achieving aldehyde&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered structural reorganization, switchable vapochromic sensing, and dynamically tunable photothermal conversion efficiency in responsive organic cocrystals.








Abstract
Dynamic regulation of intermolecular charge&#8208;transfer (CT) interactions in the solid state remains a key challenge in developing responsive functional materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode supramolecular strategy&#8212;is reported based on competitive and cooperative host&#8211;guest interactions&#8212;for constructing dynamic macrocycle&#8208;based CT complexes with tunable optical and photothermal properties in response to aliphatic aldehyde vapors. Two pillararene&#8208;derived macrocyclic hosts, EtLP6 and EtFLP6, form disordered CT assemblies with F4TCNQ via solvent&#8208;free grinding. These CT complexes exhibit chain&#8208;length&#8208;dependent vapochromic behavior governed by distinct mechanisms: guest&#8208;triggered disassembly or reassembly of D&#8211;A structures in EtLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (competitive regulation), and aldehyde&#8208;assisted ternary CT assembly in EtFLP6&#8208;F4TCNQ&#945; (cooperative regulation). Single&#8208;crystal structures incorporating X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal vapor&#8208;induced structural transformations that correlate directly with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption changes. Notably, such CT&#8208;state modulation enables the first vapor&#8208;regulated organic photothermal cocrystal system, with conversion efficiency tunable from non&#8208;detectable levels to over 11% under 808&#160;nm irradiation. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing solid&#8208;state supramolecular materials with multi&#8208;responsive optical and thermal functions via macrocyclic host&#8211;guest chemistry.

         <title>Topological Structure&#8208;Induced Piezoelectricity from the &#945;&#8208;Phase Poly(Vinylidene Fluoride)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The findings reveal a meron&#8208;like topological polar structure in the ring&#8208;banded spherulites of &#945;&#8208;phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The symmetry breaking induced by strain&#8208;gradient twisted lamellae generates a net polarization, which accounts for the observed unprecedented piezoelectricity. The topology&#8208;induced polarization mechanism uncovered in this work offers a generalizable strategy for engineering diverse polar polymers with unprecedented polarization&#8208;dependent functionalities.








Abstract
Topologically polar structures offer a rich landscape for uncovering emergent phenomena inaccessible in traditional ferroelectric materials. In contrast to the numerous examples found in ferroelectric oxides, topological structures identified in ferroelectric polymers are extremely rare. Here, the creation of a meron&#8208;like topological polar structure is demonstrated in the non&#8208;polar &#945;&#8208;phase poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF). The formation of the twisted lamellae within ring&#8208;banded polymer spherulites and the resulting topological structure are revealed using combined experimental and computational methods. Non&#8208;zero polarization is demonstrated using Kelvin probe force microscopy, second harmonic generation measurement, and dielectric spectroscopy, and verify the facilitation of polarization orientation by strain in the topological &#945;&#8208;phase PVDF. Accordingly, piezoelectricity in the topological &#945;&#8208;phase PVDF is demonstrated through both direct and converse measurements and reveals a strong correlation between polarization, the piezoelectric coefficient, and the topological structure. This result offers a new perspective on creating polar topological structures and inducing formerly symmetry&#8208;forbidden properties like piezoelectricity in the non&#8208;polar phase of ferroelectric polymers.

         <title>Stopping Phase Separation Enables Durable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;locking polyquaternium network strategy is proposed to suppress local electric fields that drive light&#8208;induced phase segregation. This approach enables wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite photovoltaics to achieve high efficiencies under both indoor and outdoor illumination, accompanied by extended operational stability. The findings establish a general design principle for durable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites and open new opportunities for indoor energy harvesting and integration with the Internet of Things.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation presents a fundamental barrier to the longevity of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. Herein, a multifunctional ionic polymer, polyquaternium&#8208;37, is reported as an effective grain boundary passivator to inhibit the degradation pathway. This dual&#8208;interaction mechanism concertedly arrests halide migration at grain boundaries, thereby suppressing local electric&#8208;field and ultimately curbing light&#8208;induced phase separation. Consequently, the modified WBG perovskites demonstrate robust photostability under light stress. The champion inverted perovskite photovoltaic device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.86% under AM 1.5G illumination and an outstanding indoor PCE of 43.19% under 1000 lux. Remarkably, the modified device exhibits a projected T90 lifetime exceeding 10 000 h under continuous indoor light cycling. This work pioneers a facile solution to halide segregation via grain boundary engineering, paving the way for operationally stable WBG perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Close&#8208;Loop Cathode Chemistry Enables Self&#8208;Rejuvenating Aqueous Zn&#8211;Te Batteries Compromised by Non&#8208;Equilibrium Redox Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triethylsulfonium iodide (TESI) inhibits Te shuttling in aqueous Zn&#8208;Te batteries through three synergistic functions. TES+ forms a protective interphase on Zn, blocking shuttling and enabling uniform plating. I&#8722; catalyzes Te redox with reduced hysteresis, while generated I3&#8722; establishes closed&#8208;loop I3&#8722;/&#8722; redox to regenerate the cathode. This enables 94.3% capacity retention after 1500 cycles with a 12&#8208;hour rest.








Abstract
Tellurium (Te) emerges as an alluring cathode material for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, boasting an unrivaled six&#8208;electron&#8208;transfer capacity (1260 mAh g&#8722;1 and 7829 mAh cm&#8722;3). However, the battery performance and cycling stability are severely degraded by inherent TeOx&#183;H2O(aq) shuttle arising from proton&#8208;tunneling&#8208;induced non&#8208;equilibrium electrochemical hydrolysis, where proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) dominates. In this work, a rejuvenation of dead Zn&#8211;Te batteries is demonstrated based on a close&#8208;loop chemistry via employing organic triethylsulfonium iodide (C6H15SI, TESI). The triiodide anions (I3&#8722;) are found to reduce dissolved TeOx&#183;H2O(aq.) with thermodynamic favorability to revitalize Te cathode, meanwhile, generated I2 is recycled back into the electrolyte by reacting with iodide anions. Simply left resting for 12&#160;h, a completely degraded Zn&#8211;Te cell (1500 cycles) recovered 94.3% of its initial capacity (465 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, TES+ is found to promote an anode solid electrolyte interphase via detaching ethyl. The functional layer efficaciously prevented anode passivation caused by tellurium&#8208;shuttling and facilitated efficient zinc&#8208;ion transfer to achieve dendrite&#8208;free zinc anode. This loop chemistry not only extends the lifespan of batteries but also enables the reuse of materials, potentially reducing the overall cost of battery production and resource consumption.

Furthermore, TES&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is found to promote an anode solid electrolyte interphase via detaching ethyl. The functional layer efficaciously prevented anode passivation caused by tellurium-shuttling and facilitated efficient zinc-ion transfer to achieve dendrite-free zinc anode. This loop chemistry not only extends the lifespan of batteries but also enables the reuse of materials, potentially reducing the overall cost of battery production and resource consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Observation of Atom Motion and Manipulation of Structural Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely controling focused electron beam irradiation on KTaO3 single crystal, not only atomic scale phase transformation from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 can be triggered along a specific crystalline direction, but also Ta atom migration process is directly observed. Moreover, the tetragonal tungsten bronze K6Ta10.8O30 formed here remains stable at ambient condition.








Abstract
Precisely controlling structural transformations is essential for realizing novel functionalities in crystal materials, as these transformations often result in significant changes in physical and chemical properties. However, such structural control at the atomic scale remains a formidable challenge. Here the direct observation and realization of atomic scale structural transformation is demonstrated from KTaO3 to K6Ta10.8O30 via high&#8208;energy electron beam manufacturing in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which can finally manipulate the Ta atom movements. The K and O vacancies in KTaO3 can be introduced via the knock&#8208;on energy transferred from the controled high&#8208;dose electron beams. These vacancies can further accommodate Ta atom emerging at the interstitial sites of the TaO2 plane in KTaO3. Thus, all atom species in KTaO3 can be stimulated via electron beam and the cooperative movements of them trigger the final formation of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase. The detailed mechanisms are revealed by low&#8208;dose, in situ, atomic scale imaging under STEM. The controllability of this electron beam manufacture process and the stability of the new K6Ta10.8O30 phase is further validated. DFT calculations rationalize the triggering steps of the manufacture process and show the transformation is energetically beneficial at the condition of K and O vacancies introduced by knock&#8208;on effect. This work not only investigates the microscopic mechanism of electron beam&#8208;induced structural transformation, but also establishes a versatile pathway for synthesizing new functional materials with tailored properties.

         <title>NH3&#8208;Guided Low&#8208;Temperature Nanostructural Refinement Boosts Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven H2O2 Synthesis in Ionic Carbon Nitrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructural refinement strategy is reported for KPHI photocatalysts using NH4Cl in a molten salt environment to induce coherent domain fragmentation and controlled cyano defect formation. This dual modification promotes n&#8594;&#960;* transitions, enhances charge separation, and accelerates ORR kinetics, yielding exceptional AQY values of 49% (410 nm) and 5% (525 nm) without cocatalysts.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven oxygen reduction on ionic carbon nitride frameworks presents a compelling strategy for sustainable hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. Herein, a nanostructural engineering strategy is presented to tailor the morphology and defect chemistry of potassium poly(heptazine imide) (KPHI), enabling extended solar coverage and enhance photocatalytic performance. By incorporating NH4Cl into a molten KCl/LiCl eutectic medium, simultaneous nanoscale fragmentation of KPHI crystals and controlled introduction of cyano (&#8211;C&#8801;N) defects are achieved. These molecular modifications induce n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transitions, facilitate efficient charge separation, and accelerate oxygen reduction reaction kinetics. The optimal catalyst reaches an apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 49% at 410&#160;nm and 5% at 525&#160;nm without the need for cocatalysts, among the highest values reported for metal&#8208;free photocatalyst systems. Transient absorption spectroscopy confirms preferential photoexcited electron localization at &#8211;C&#8801;N sites, highlighting their key role in enhancing the charge carrier dynamics. Crucially, autogenous NH3 pressure is harnessed from NH4Cl decomposition to unlock a low&#8208;temperature (500 &#176;C) KPHI variant that delivers analogous performance to its counterpart produced at 600&#160;&#176;C, offering a more sustainable synthetic route. This study elucidates the structure&#8208;activity relationship in ionic carbon nitrides and provides a generalizable approach for controlling their morphology and defect characteristics.

         <title>Schottky&#8208;Barrier&#8208;Free Plasmonic WO3&#8208;Based Photocatalysts for Simultaneous N2 Fixation and H2O2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalyst is designed by combining multiple doping strategies together in WO3 nanoplates. The optimized photocatalyst exbibits enhanced light absorption, hot charge carrier generation, and N2 activation. It can produce NH3 and H2O2 simultaneously. A type of floating biphasic plasmonic photocatalytic film is further fabricated to improve the efficiency and scalability of the photocatalytic process.








Abstract
Plasmonic photocatalysis has recently received much attention in generating high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic photocatalysts are frontier materials that can effectively employ localized surface plasmon resonance to generate and utilize hot charge carriers. Herein, the development of a new type of Schottky&#8208;barrier&#8208;free plasmonic WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst through hydrogen doping, oxygen vacancy (OV) introduction, and metal doping is reported. Hydrogen doping and OV introduction broaden the light absorption range of the WO3&#8208;based photocatalyst, thereby enabling the generation of more hot charge carriers. Metal doping provides more catalytically active sites. More interestingly, both hot electrons and holes can be used to generate high&#8208;value&#8208;added products, i.e., ammonia and hydrogen peroxide. The optimal Mo&#8208;H0.23WO3&#8722;x photocatalyst exhibits excellent ammonia and hydrogen peroxide production rates of 187.53 and 196.25 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, respectively. Furthermore, a biphasic photocatalytic system is designed to suppress light absorption by water and maximize sunlight utilization. This work expands the scope of plasmonic photocatalysts towards degenerately doped plasmonic metal oxide semiconductors and provides a new paradigm for the solar&#8208;driven generation of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Afterglow from Luminescent Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments has been developed by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators. 








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent polymeric materials which combine afterglow emission with mechanical flexibility and adaptability to external stimuli are well&#8208;suited for dynamic optical devices, encoding, anticounterfeiting, and soft robotics. However, current systems rely on static matrices and organic phosphors, which limit their afterglow duration, flexibility, processability, and responsiveness to various stimuli. Here, an active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators is demonstrated. The resulting material exhibits ultralong emission (up to 1200 s) in the dark, enabling reprogrammable information encryption and reversible scattering&#8208;to&#8208;transparent transition upon mechanical, thermal, or light stimuli, allowing for multimodal decoding. A bicolor, spatially encoded phosphorescent soft actuator is fabricated that appears plain and unmarked under daylight, but reveals structured emission in the dark while simultaneously exhibiting shape change under heat or light. Incorporation of an additional fluorescent dye further endows the system with light&#8208;environment sensitivity, enabling luminescent rolling wheels and fiber actuators capable of self&#8208;signaling and recovery tracking. This work not only demonstrates constructing active luminescent materials but also provides valuable insights toward adaptive and interactive glowing optical devices.

Here, an active glow luminescent system for encoding, signaling, and tracking in dark environments by integrating inorganic ultralong afterglow phosphors with adaptive liquid crystal elastomer actuators is demonstrated. The resulting material exhibits ultralong emission (up to 1200 s) in the dark, enabling reprogrammable information encryption and reversible scattering-to-transparent transition upon mechanical, thermal, or light stimuli, allowing for multimodal decoding. A bicolor, spatially encoded phosphorescent soft actuator is fabricated that appears plain and unmarked under daylight, but reveals structured emission in the dark while simultaneously exhibiting shape change under heat or light. Incorporation of an additional fluorescent dye further endows the system with light-environment sensitivity, enabling luminescent rolling wheels and fiber actuators capable of self-signaling and recovery tracking. This work not only demonstrates constructing active luminescent materials but also provides valuable insights toward adaptive and interactive glowing optical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Full Crystallographic Imaging of Hexagonal Boron Nitride Monolayers with Phonon&#8208;Enhanced Sum&#8208;Frequency Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonlinear optical microscopy technique is introduced that enables rapid imaging of hexagonal boron nitride monolayers, which are usually optically invisible. The nonlinear mixing of mid&#8208;infrared and visible laser pulses enables full crystallographic imaging through phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency generation microscopy, where the resonant excitation of a phonon provides 800&#8208;fold enhancement.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an important 2D material for van der Waals heterostructures, single photon emitters, and infrared nanophotonics. The optical characterization of mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layer samples of hBN however, remains a challenge as the material is almost invisible optically. Here, phase&#8208;resolved sum&#8208;frequency microscopy is introduced as a technique for imaging monolayers of hBN grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and visualizing their crystal orientation. Femtosecond mid&#8208;infrared (IR) and visible laser pulses are used for sum&#8208;frequency generation (SFG), which is imaged in a wide&#8208;field optical microscope. The IR laser resonantly excites a phonon of hBN that leads to an &#8776;800&#8208;fold enhancement of the SFG intensity, making it possible to image large 100&#160;&#215;&#160;100&#160;&#181;m2 sample areas in less than 1 s. Heterodyne detection combined with azimuthal sample rotation further provides full crystallographic information. Combined knowledge of topography and crystal orientation reveals that triangular domains of CVD&#8208;grown monolayer hBN have nitrogen&#8208;terminated zigzag edges. Overall, SFG microscopy is an ultra&#8208;sensitive tool with the potential to image crystal structure, strain, stacking sequences, and twist angles in a wide range of van der Waals structures, where locating and identifying monolayer regions and interfaces with broken inversion symmetry is of paramount importance.

         <title>Creating Favorable Pt/Co Interfaces via a Two&#8208;Step Approach for Constructing Highly Durable PtCo Intermetallic Fuel Cell Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amino acid&#8208;assisted two&#8208;step approach is developed to prepare L12&#8208;Pt3Co intermetallic catalyst with an increased ordering degree for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The optimal amino acids (L&#8208;Cystine) can establish a favorable Co&#8208;rich environment around fine Pt nanoparticles during thermal conversion, facilitating Co diffusion into the Pt nanoparticles. The L12&#8208;Pt3Co demonstrates compelling performance and long&#8208;term durability in MEA under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle conditions, attributed to the high degree of ordering in the Pt3Co catalyst.








Abstract
Structurally ordered PtCo intermetallics are one of the most promising oxygen&#8208;reduction catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) due to their intrinsically improved catalytic activity and stability relative to PtCo solid&#8208;solution alloys. However, increasing the heating temperature to achieve a desirable high degree of ordering results in severe particle agglomeration and low mass activity and stability. Herein, a two&#8208;step synthesis approach is developed to create an L12&#8208;Pt3Co intermetallic structure with an increased ordering degree and well&#8208;dispersed ultrafine particles. The first step of the synthesis yields ultrafine Pt nanoparticles that are well&#8208;dispersed on the ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon support. The second adsorption step enables us to fine&#8208;tune the Pt and Co interfaces, assisted by optimal amino acids, to establish a favorable Co&#8208;rich environment around fine Pt nanoparticles, facilitating Co diffusion into the Pt crystalline under mild thermal conditions (&lt;800 &#176;C). This two&#8208;step ordered L12&#8208;Pt3Co catalyst is systematically evaluated using membrane electrode assemblies under heavy&#8208;duty vehicle (HDV) conditions and demonstrated exceptional performance and durability, retaining 1.35 A cm&#8208;2 only a 7% loss in current density at 0.7&#160;V after an extensive accelerated stress test of 150,000 voltage cycles.

Cyclically regenerated Co atom clusters (Coac) from the heterostructured CoSe&#8208;ZnSe bimetallic selenide anode are novel, high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state bulk electrocatalysts. They significantly accelerate ZnSe anode conversion reactions for fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries, overcoming solid&#8208;state bulk catalyst design bottlenecks with high catalytic efficiency, electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation in long&#8208;cycle tests, endowing the battery with excellent cycle stability and ultra&#8208;high rate performance.









Abstract
Catalysts are pivotal in enhancing reaction kinetics across various domains, including energy conversion and storage. However, their application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has been largely unexplored, primarily due to the challenges posed by solid&#8208;solid conversion reactions in bulk electrode materials, and electrochemical instability and passivation of electrocatalysts during cycling. Herein, this study presents that Co atom clusters (Coac) cyclically regenerate from a designed heterostructure of bimetallic selenides anode (CoSe&#8211;ZnSe) during electrochemical lithiation process as a novel and effective solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase electrocatalyst can significantly accelerate conversion reactions of ZnSe anode for fast&#8208;charging LIBs. The propose strategy overcomes the bottlenecks in solid&#8208;state bulk&#8208;phase catalyst design, imparting Coac catalyst with high catalytic efficiency, full&#8208;voltage&#8208;range electrochemical stability and anti&#8208;passivation during long&#8208;cycling test. With catalytic effect of Coac, the batteries demonstrate fast&#8208;charging performance such as unprecedented rate capability up to 50 A g&#8722;1, as well as high&#8208;rate long cyclability (3000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Ultrahigh Cell Density 3D Bioprinting by Acoustic Fluids&#8208;mediated Stereolithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) enables ultrahigh cell density 3D bioprinting by using surface acoustic waves to assemble cells for biomimetic constructs with hierarchical architectures. Integrated with acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange, ASL rapidly fabricates functional liver models, advancing disease modeling, regenerative medicine, and artificial organ engineering.








Abstract
Dense cell populations and their complex structures are the essentials of physiologically functional solid organs, but their biomimetic construction is challenging. Here, an ultrahigh cell density (UHCD) bioprinting system is presented for fabricating organ&#8208;analogous intricate architectures based on an acoustic fluids&#8208;mediated stereolithography (ASL) technique. The ASL can achieve cell aggregation on a prepolymerized solid&#8211;liquid interface with densities comparable to native tissues through focused surface acoustic waves&#8208;induced vortices. Meanwhile, the ASL&#8208;based UHCD bioprinting shows reduced light scattering in each ultrathin layer printing process, reaching cell densities of 1 billion cells&#160;mL&#8722;1. Additionally, by incorporating an acoustic&#8208;assisted medium exchange system, the ASL facilitates the bioprinting of multicellular components in arbitrary architectures. Based on these features, ASL's capability in fabricating structure&#8208;mimetic liver tissue models with regenerative functionalities is demonstrated. It is believed that the ASL technique achieves breakthroughs in UHCD bioprinting, opening new avenues in the development of artificial tissue and organ engineering.

         <title>Thermoplastic Molding of Chitosan to Form Living Plastic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a thermomechanical compression technique to densify chitosan into stable, custom&#8208;shaped plastics with multifunctionality. The relatively mild processing conditions of the method allow the integration of biomolecules without the need for covalent cross&#8208;linkers to prepare bioactive materials along with the successful incorporation of pollutant&#8208;degrading microbes, resulting in &#8220;living plastics&#8221; capable of bioremediation.








Abstract
Numerous approaches for the solution&#8208;based fabrication of chitosan&#8208;based materials are reported, but most often result in materials with limitations in terms of stability in aqueous systems and mechanics unless chemical cross&#8208;linking is utilized. In the present study, a thermomechanical compression method is presented for solid&#8208;state processing of chitosan powders into dense bulk plastic&#8208;like materials where the mechanical and physical properties can be tailored. To achieve this outcome, chitosan&#8208;citrate complexes, formed through ionic cross&#8208;linking and amidation, undergo thermal fusion at high temperature and pressure to generate robust materials with retention of the inherent properties of chitosan, including biodegradability and cytocompatibility. The chitosan&#8208;based plastics can be doped with enzymes and antibiotics with retention of bioactivity and are also explored as living materials when microbial cells (e.g., Pseudomonas putida) are included in the process and subsequently shown to maintain metabolic functions to degrade organic pollutants. This thermoplastic approach for solid&#8208;state processing of chitosan enables the development of a variety of new materials and composites with embedded biomolecules for enhanced functions. This solid&#8208;state fabrication of chitosan bulk materials approach eliminates the need for conventional solution&#8208;based processing, enabling rapid material production via compression molding while reducing costs, minimizing waste, and improving overall manufacturing efficiency.

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh n&#8208;Type Thermoelectric Power Factor in an Intrinsically Large Transport&#8208;Fermi Energy Gap Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with a record&#8208;high power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. This exceptional performance is attributed to its intrinsically large transport&#8208;Fermi energy gap, enhanced doping facilitated by side chain&#8208;ionized dopant interactions, and efficient interchain coupling via BT units, offering valuable insights for the design of advanced organic thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
The conductivity of organic thermoelectric materials has seen significant improvements in the past few years, but often at the expense of the Seebeck coefficient. Consequently, the thermoelectric performance, especially for n&#8208;type materials, remains considerably lower than that of their inorganic counterparts. Herein, a high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymer, P(TDPP&#8208;BT&#8208;LEG) is reported, with an unexpectedly high Seebeck coefficient and ultrahigh power factor, driven by its intrinsically large energy gap between the Fermi and transport energy levels and high charge carrier mobility. Notably, it is shown that strong electrostatic interactions induced by the ethylene glycol side chains facilitate charge transfer between the dopants and the polymer. This enables effective doping of polymers with high LUMO levels. Furthermore, efficient charge transport, arising from favorable molecular packing, allows the polymer to maintain high electrical conductivity even at low charge carrier concentrations. Ultimately, this polymer achieves a record&#8208;high n&#8208;type power factor of 397 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2, with a high Seebeck coefficient of &#8722;420 &#181;V&#160;K&#8210;1. This study highlights the potential of enhancing the Seebeck coefficient through precise energy level tuning and molecular design, fundamentally advancing the rational design of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Broadband Plane Blackbody by Ultrafast Laser Induced Surface Hierarchical Structuring and Nanodefect Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid micro&#8208;nano periodic structure, realized via a one&#8208;step process utilizing the mechanism of ultrafast laser multiple interaction with a silicon surface, is reported. This structure simultaneously achieves suppression of optical backscattering and energy band engineering. The fabricated surface exhibits exceptional uniformity and stability as a blackbody, thereby addressing the stability and uniformity challenges of plan blackbodies under protracted deployment.








Abstract
Blackbodies, ideal light&#8208;absorbing objects per Planck's law, do not occur in nature on Earth. Nevertheless, they are of utmost significance in applications across astronomy, optoelectronics, and thermal radiation engineering. While artificial counterparts such as cavity blackbodies and plane blackbodies can approximate ideal blackbodies to some extent, they are beset with problems, including large volume, low emissivity, narrow bandwidth, poor uniformity, and feeble adhesion. Here, a method relying on ultrafast laser direct irradiation is reported, which enables fast writing of uniform plane blackbodies with high&#8208;emissivity over 0.98 in an ultra&#8208;broadband spectrum of 3&#8211;14 &#181;m on a doped silicon surface. A phenomenon of energy negative feedback regulation in laser&#8208;material is discovered, which allows for the simultaneous implementation of hierarchical surface structuring and nanodefect&#8208;induced energy&#8208;level engineering. The resulting micro&#8208;nano hierarchical cone&#8208;array structure effectively curbs light back&#8208;scattering and intensifies nanodefect&#8208;induced absorption. Since the laser&#8208;treated surface does not entail material adhesion or injection, it exhibits superior stability in contrast to traditional black coatings. This is corroborated by high&#8208;temperature tests exceeding 900&#160;&#176;C and repeated mechanical exfoliation tests, underscoring its resilience in harsh environmental conditions.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Nanorelay Enhances Ligand&#8208;to&#8208;Metal Charge Transfer in Lanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks during Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>

         <dc:description>
Electron&#8208;rich closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; is first incorporated into a lanthanide metal&#8208;organic framework (Ln&#8208;MOF), forming B12H12@Tb&#8208;based Ln&#8208;MOF, where closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; acts as an electron nanorelay to enhance ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer during photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Single&#8208;crystal, in situ, and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic techniques reveal the complete mechanistic pathway, providing guidance for the rational design of highly efficient catalysts for artificialphotosynthesis.








Abstract
Lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) exhibit potential yet limitations for photocatalytic CO2 conversion. Their &#8220;potential&#8221; stems from their CO2 adsorption capability, attributed to the ligand&#8208;field effects and specialized pore microenvironments; the &#8220;limitation&#8221; is due to the inertness of ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) originating from the 4f electron shielding effect, high ionization energies, and low electron affinities. Introducing electron&#8208;rich active components, acting as nanorelays, into Ln&#8208;MOF pores offers a viable strategy to overcome these drawbacks, though the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, the mechanistic pathway underlying efficient photocatalytic CO2 conversion in the B12H12@Tb&#8208;based MOF composite is elucidated, wherein the electron&#8208;rich closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; serves as the counteranion and functions within the pores as an electron nanorelay. The crystalline structure of this composite is revealed by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction data. In situ and transient techniques, together with theoretical calculation, uncovered the serial mechanism, including how closo&#8208;[B12H12]2&#8722; nanorelay facilitates a radical&#8208;assisted electron transfer and subsequently improves LMCT within Ln&#8208;MOF, as well as how Tb3+ serves as the catalytic active center for the intermediate process pathways of CO2 molecules. These mechanistic studies not only unveil the &#8220;black box&#8221; of MOF&#8208;based composite photocatalyst, but also provide solutions for the development of efficient artificial photosynthesis catalysts.

         <title>Circumventing Self&#8208;Diffusion Enables High&#8208;Rate Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals that slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) as the primary factor hindering the rate capability of hard carbon. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier in the low potential.








Abstract
Hard carbons (HCs) are promising anode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), yet their application faces a critical challenge that sluggish kinetics in low&#8208;potential regions (&lt;0.1&#160;V) severely limit fast&#8208;charging capability, and the origin of this limitation remains unclear. Here, this study reveals slow sodium self&#8208;diffusion within metallic clusters as the fundamental barrier of hard carbons, by combining first&#8208;principles calculations and in/ex situ characterizations. By rationally designing a heterostructure where long&#8208;ranged anisotropic graphitic nanobelts are in situ embedded into isotropic amorphous carbon matrix, Na+ diffusion kinetics is redirected from the slow metallic&#8208;cluster self&#8208;diffusion to the rapid interlaminar pathways through the extended graphitic stacks, thereby significantly circumventing the sodium diffusion barrier at the low potential. The optimized HCs achieve a high reversible capacity (386 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mA g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (312 mAh g&#8722;1 at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and robust long&#8208;term cyclic stability (98% after 1000 cycles) in a conventional ester electrolyte, with energy density and power density surpassing those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. These findings provide fundamental insights into high&#8208;rate hard carbons for advanced SIBs.

         <title>Facile Bottom&#8208;Up Assembly of Photonic Micropatterns via Surface&#8208;Guided Colloidal Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns with vivid structural colors are fabricated through bottom&#8208;up assembly, guided by surface&#8208;dependent regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth of colloidal particles. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by controlling particle size and interparticle attraction, while in situ color mixing is enabled by exclusive crystallization of bidisperse particles, expanding the accessible color palette.








Abstract
Photonic micropatterns derived from colloidal self&#8208;assembly are highly sought after for next&#8208;generation optical and functional devices. However, achieving high optical quality, spatial precision, and stopband tunability with a simple fabrication process remains challenging due to the limitations of conventional top&#8208;down techniques. Here, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is reported for fabricating high&#8208;resolution photonic micropatterns via regioselective heterogeneous nucleation and crystallization of polystyrene particles, directed by surface&#8208;dependent nucleation behavior. On strongly charged glass, nucleation is suppressed, while on weakly charged photoresist surfaces, it is promoted via depletion&#8208;mediated attraction. Photoresist micropatterns prepared by standard photolithography enable single&#8208;step, spatially localized crystal growth without physical confinement. The resulting crystalline grains exhibit uniform orientation and minimal intergrain gaps, displaying intense structural colors. By systematically tuning depletant and salt concentrations, an optimal pair potential well depth is identified that yields superior&#8208;quality photonic micropatterns. Full&#8208;spectrum color tunability is achieved by varying particle size while maintaining this optimal interaction range. Moreover, bidisperse systems show exclusive crystallization of distinct grain types within a single pattern, enabling in situ color mixing and extended color palettes. Beyond photolithography, that accessible charge&#8208;guided patterning is demonstrated using vapor&#8208;phase masking, oil stamping, and even fingerprints, highlighting the versatility and scalability of this bottom&#8208;up approach.

         <title>Trace Oxygen&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of High&#8208;Quality Graphene with Improved Electrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the critical role of trace oxygen in graphene synthesis. Superclean graphene films are synthesized via trace oxygen&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition. Experimental and computational analyses elucidate the dual role of oxygen in etching amorphous carbon and assisting defect repair during graphene growth. This strategy substantially enhances graphene's crystallinity while simultaneously improving its electronic performance.








Abstract
Point defects and amorphous carbon contamination, which are almost inevitable during the high&#8208;temperature chemical vapor deposition growth process, are demonstrated to severely degrade the intrinsic properties of graphene films, particularly their electronic performance. This study puts forward a trace oxygen&#8208;assisted strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;quality graphene by effectively eradicating amorphous carbon contamination and then promoting the repair of underlying lattice defects. Both experimental results and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that lattice healing is inhibited when the lattice is covered by amorphous carbon but facilitated with the aid of oxygen. The high crystallinity of the synthesized graphene is evidenced by its strong resistance to electron&#8208;beam radiation and mechanical property (2D Young's modulus &#8776;355 N&#160;m&#8722;1 and fracture strength &#8776;1778 nN) comparable to that of exfoliated graphene. Furthermore, the as&#8208;obtained graphene film exhibits enhanced electronic performance, including a low sheet resistance of 174.4 &#177; 31.9 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and a high carrier mobility exceeding 15&#160;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This work not only elucidates the novel functions of oxygen in the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene but also offers new prospects for further enhancing the performance of graphene.

         <title>An Intelligence Programmable Intrathecal Injection System Based on Tween 80&#8208;Confined Halide Perovskite Optoelectronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The innovative Tween 80 confinement strategy modulates Cs2AgBiBr6 crystallization by suppressing bromine vacancy (Brvac) formation, enabling the optoelectronic memristor to exhibit electronic synaptic functionality and transient photoresponse (TPR). By leveraging the multi&#8208;wavelength modulation capability of TPR, an all&#8208;optically controlled drug delivery system is demonstrated. This work expands the frontiers of optoelectronic devices applications in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free inorganic perovskites have emerged as promising candidates to replace the lead&#8208;based perovskites and expedite the commercialization of optoelectronic devices, owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties, tunable bandgap, and long carrier diffusion lengths. However, uncontrollable nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites pose a major challenge to device performance. Herein, a Tween 80&#8208;confined Cs2AgBiBr6&#8208;based optoelectronic memristor is presented that exhibits both electronic synaptic functionality (ESF) and transient photoresponse (TPR). The Tween 80 confinement strategy effectively suppresses bromine vacancy (Brvac) and promotes the formation of a high&#8208;quality, pinhole&#8208;free perovskite film, which endows the device with outstanding optoelectronic performance. Leveraging the ESF under electrical stimulation, the as&#8208;fabricated device achieves highly efficient pattern recognition. Under optical stimulation, it demonstrates a TPR with 20&#160;ms response time, an extended durability of 931.7&#160;s, and excellent repeatability over 1000 cycles at 5&#160;Hz. Furthermore, the device achieves all&#8208;optical writing and erasing through combined optical stimuli, enabling complex image encryption/writing tasks. Finally, an all&#8208;optically controlled intrathecal injection system is designed based on the device, incorporating six specific drug release strategies. Therefore, this work provides innovative insights into the application of optoelectronic memristors in biomedical and life sciences, paving the way for the development of smart medicine.

         <title>Ambient&#8208;Compatible Solvent Bath Thermal Annealing for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells and Large&#8208;Area Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solvent bath thermal annealing (STA) approach is developed for efficient ambient processing of organic solar cells and modules. STA immerses the active layer in perfluorodecalin to ensure uniform heating and protection from oxygen and moisture, optimizing film crystallinity and molecular packing. The strategy yields exceptional device efficiency, stability, and scalability, significantly enhancing the prospects for large&#8208;area manufacturing.








Abstract
Thermal annealing is essential for optimizing the bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs), yet traditional thermal annealing (TA) under ambient air suffers from film degradation and nonuniform heating. Here, a novel post&#8208;treatment, solvent bath thermal annealing (STA), enabling effective TA of large&#8208;area OSC active layers under ambient conditions, is introduced. In STA, the BHJ film is immersed in a perfluorodecalin (PFD) bath during heating, ensuring uniform thermal distribution and protection against oxygen and moisture. STA&#8208;treated films thus exhibit optimized vertical component distribution, enhanced crystallinity, and improved molecular packing with higher structural order, leading to efficient charge transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination regardless of the annealing atmosphere. As a result, STA&#8208;treated OSCs based on PM6/L8&#8208;BO blend deliver outstanding performance: small&#8208;area cells achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05%, while large&#8208;area (20.25&#160;cm2) modules attain a PCE of 17.37% (certified 16.75%), among the highest PCEs for large&#8208;area organic solar modules. It also successfully bridges the performance gap between inert and ambient processing conditions. Moreover, STA&#8208;treated devices show excellent operational stability under continuous illumination and thermal stress. This ambient&#8208;compatible annealing strategy thus provides a scalable route toward high&#8208;efficiency and stable organic solar modules for practical large&#8208;area manufacturing.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Flow Modulation of CaF2/CaAl12O19:Dy Heterojunctions for Enhanced Mechanoluminescence in Flexible Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterojunctions are constructed by in situ growing CaF2:Dy on the CaAl12O19:Dy particles. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the constructed CaF2/ CaAl12O19:Dy heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds boost the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2, enhancing the interfacial triboelectricity and thus yielding improved mechanoluminescent performance in terms of intensity, repeatbility, and self&#8208;recoverability in flexible composites.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) flexible composites show broad application prospects in stretchable optoelectronics and wearable devices. However, challenges such as low brightness, inadequate repeatability, and restricted self&#8208;recoverability hinder their practical use. Aiming to these issues, this work demonstrates the effectiveness of the heterojunction strategy on the interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;induced ML in flexible composites. Herein, the typical interfacial triboelectricity&#8208;dependent ML material of CaF2:Dy is in situ grown on the trap&#8208;controlled ML material of CaAl12O19:Dy (CA6:Dy) because of their high crystal lattice matching ability. Compared with the single&#8208;phase materials, the CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions exhibit outstanding ML performance in the flexible polydimethylsiloxane matrix, which can achieve repeatable ML for over 10&#160;000 times with a self&#8208;recovery degree of ca. 91.60%. The trap&#8208;controlled mechanism and interfacial triboelectrification&#8208;induced electron bombardment model are both responsible for the ML of CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy heterojunctions. Theoretical calculation results suggest that the construction of heterojunction interfaces via F&#9472;Al&#9472;O and F&#9472;Ca&#9472;O bonds can effectively prompt the charge flow from CA6 to CaF2. This endows CaF2/CA6:0.06Dy with enhanced interfacial triboelectricity and enriched trap structure, leading to improved ML properties. This work confirms that rational heterojunction design can overcome the limitations of single&#8208;phase materials in flexible matrices, offering a robust platform for the development of high&#8208;performance and flexible ML materials.

A hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) stabilizes 4.5 V&#8208;class Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;nickel cathodes and Si&#8208;majority graphite anodes by forming a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase at the Si||electrolyte junction. The HSE enables a broad operating temperature range from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C and excellent cycling performance of 1.4 Ah pouch cells with 80% capacity retention after 1150 cycles.








Abstract
4.5&#160;V&#8208;class lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) pairing LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC811) cathodes with silicon&#8208;majority graphite (SmG, &gt;1500 mAh g&#8722;1) anodes can surpass 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, but their cycling stability, safety, and low&#8208;temperature operation are constrained by the difficulty in constructing stable interphase. This study reports a hybrid&#8208;sulfonamide electrolyte (HSE) that can survive the aggressive chemistry of high&#8208;voltage NMC811 and programs a self&#8208;limiting inorganic interphase on Si by leveraging the electron&#8208;limited onset at the Si||electrolyte junction. At first lithiation, the semiconductor characteristic and native SiOx create a space&#8208;charge (depletion) region, so the anionic&#8208;structure&#8208;like sulfonamides bias first&#8208;electron reduction, seeding lithium halide/chalcogenide inorganics that are electronically insulating yet Li+&#8208;permeable. The resulting thin, dense layer suppresses electron tunneling, dissolution, and resists crack&#8208;induced stress concentration during Si expansion&#8212;thereby self&#8208;limiting further growth. Consequently, NMC811||SmG coin cells with the HSE retain 80% capacity after 500 cycles at 4.5&#160;V and &#8776;5 mAh cm&#8722;2 and operate over a wide range of temperature from &#8722;40 to 60 &#176;C, markedly outperforming the carbonate electrolyte. 1.4 Ah pouch cells maintain 80.0% of initial capacity after 1150 cycles and exhibit thermal stability up to 300 &#176;C. This work establishes self&#8208;limiting interphase formation on Si as a practical electrolyte design target for high&#8208;energy LIBs.

         <title>Electron Percolating Shielded Interlayer Enabling Ultrastable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer of PTAA/SnO2 (PS) is designed at the LLZTO solid electrolyte and Li metal interface, which creates a reverse electric field to block electron leakage, significantly reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO. Li dendrite formation is greatly suppressed at the surface and bulk of LLZTO, which contributes to the outstanding electrochemical performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
The electron percolation of grain boundaries in Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZTO) induces internal lithium deposition and penetration, causing short circuits of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, which has become a significant obstacle hindering the practical application of LLZTO. In this work, an electron&#8208;percolating shielded interface constructing strategy is proposed between LLZTO and lithium metal (Li) to simultaneously suppress the Li dendrite growth at both the interface and within the LLZTO electrolyte. A Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA)/SnO2 (PS) bilayer is therefore designed between LLZTO and Li metal (LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li), where the hole&#8208;rich PTAA and electron&#8208;rich SnO2 generate a reverse electric field that effectively blocks the electron leakage, thereby reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO and preventing its internal dendrite formation. Furthermore, the smooth and compact PTAA/SnO2 coating significantly enhances interfacial contact and equalizes the interfacial potential to promote a uniform Li plating. As a result, the Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|Li symmetric battery achieves stable cycling for over 5000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The Li|LLZTO&#8208;PS|LiFePO4 full battery demonstrates 86.2% capacity after 2000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C. This study presents a novel interfacial engineering strategy for enhancing the performance and durability of garnet&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The electron percolation of grain boundaries in Li&lt;sub&gt;6.4&lt;/sub&gt;La&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;1.4&lt;/sub&gt;Ta&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (LLZTO) induces internal lithium deposition and penetration, causing short circuits of all-solid-state batteries, which has become a significant obstacle hindering the practical application of LLZTO. In this work, an electron-percolating shielded interface constructing strategy is proposed between LLZTO and lithium metal (Li) to simultaneously suppress the Li dendrite growth at both the interface and within the LLZTO electrolyte. A Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-triMethylphenyl)aMine] (PTAA)/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PS) bilayer is therefore designed between LLZTO and Li metal (LLZTO-PS|Li), where the hole-rich PTAA and electron-rich SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generate a reverse electric field that effectively blocks the electron leakage, thereby reducing the electronic conductivity of LLZTO and preventing its internal dendrite formation. Furthermore, the smooth and compact PTAA/SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coating significantly enhances interfacial contact and equalizes the interfacial potential to promote a uniform Li plating. As a result, the Li|LLZTO-PS|Li symmetric battery achieves stable cycling for over 5000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 2500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The Li|LLZTO-PS|LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; full battery demonstrates 86.2% capacity after 2000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;C. This study presents a novel interfacial engineering strategy for enhancing the performance and durability of garnet-based all-solid-state lithium-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deciphering Defect&#8208;Mediated Anti&#8208;Thermal Quenching Multimodal Luminescence for Information Encryption</title>

         <dc:description>
This study reports the multicolor SrZnP2O7:Sm3+/Dy3+/Tb3+/Tm3+ phosphors exhibiting exceptional multimodal luminescence in the 350&#8211;750 nm range with anti&#8208;thermal quenching properties. A charge compensation strategy is established to enhance the quantum efficiency, photoluminescence/radioluminescence, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration by precise regulation of trap distribution and density. The developed phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications.








Abstract
Multimodal luminescent materials displaying dynamically tunable multicolor emissions under diverse excitation channels are at the core of optical information encryption technologies. However, simultaneous achievement of high&#8208;performance multimodal luminescence with anti&#8208;thermal quenching (ATQ) feature remains a critical challenge. Herein, a new class of SrZnP2O7:RE (RE = Sm3+, Dy3+, Tb3+, Tm3+) phosphors is developed to fulfill these requirements through precise defect engineering. These phosphors exhibit photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence (RL), mechanoluminescence (ML), thermoluminescence (TL), and persistent luminescence (PersL) with emission spanning 350&#8211;750&#160;nm. By strategically incorporating charge compensators (Li+, Na+, K+), precise regulation of trap distribution and density is demonstrated, yielding remarkable enhancements in PL, quantum efficiency, RL intensity, and X&#8208;ray afterglow duration. Crucially, the engineered deep traps in Sm/Dy/Tm&#8208;doped systems enable exceptional ATQ behavior. Comprehensive investigations reveal the critical role of charge compensation and defect redistribution in modulating luminescence performance. Benefiting from their superior multimodal emission properties, these phosphors demonstrate great promise for X&#8208;ray imaging and high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting/encryption applications. This work establishes a new paradigm in luminescent material design, providing both fundamental insights into defect&#8208;luminescence property relationships and a practical framework for constructing advanced optical materials with tailored multimodal responses through precision trap state engineering.

         <title>Unprecedented Energy Density of Polyimide Dielectrics at Elevated Temperatures Utilizing Atomic Engineering to Decouple &#960;&#8208;Conjugation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>

This study establishes a site&#8208;specific ortho&#8208;chlorination strategy for semi&#8208;aromatic polyimides, which localizes &#960;&#8208;electrons and induces conformational distortion to disrupt intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. Consequently, the Cl&#8208;PI films deliver discharged energy densities of 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 with &gt;90% efficiency at 200 &#176;C and 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 at 250 &#176;C, demonstrating excellent high&#8208;temperature dielectric performance.








Abstract
Emerging demands for polymer dielectrics in high&#8208;power electronics and harsh environments call for polymers with simultaneously high thermal stability and electrical performance. However, most polymers suffer from rapid conduction loss at elevated temperatures. Here it is shown that atomic&#8208;level backbone chlorination of polyimide (Cl&#8208;PI) imposes &#960;&#8208;electron localization and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane steric barriers that, together, suppress through&#8208;plane hopping arising from both intrachain &#960;&#8208;conjugation and interchain &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking, dismantling long&#8208;range conduction pathways. This cooperative mechanism markedly curtails high&#8208;temperature conduction loss and yields outstanding capacitive performance, delivering discharge energy densities (Ud) of 9.52 J cm&#8722;3 at 150 &#176;C and 7.22 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C, with efficiencies exceeding 90%. Even at 250&#176;C, an unprecedented Ud of 6.79 J cm&#8722;3 is retained, outperforming reported high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers. Moreover, Cl&#8208;PI exhibits excellent self&#8208;cleaning behavior and cycling durability, sustaining over 106 cycles at 200&#160;&#176;C and 400&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 with minimal degradation. This work underscores the potential of atomic&#8208;level backbone engineering to enable next&#8208;generation polymer dielectrics for reliable, high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage.

         <title>Holistic Recovery of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries by Flash Joule Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and sustainable flash Joule heating chlorination&#8211;oxidation (FJH&#8211;ClO) process enables efficient recovery of lithium, cobalt, and graphite from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. This scalable approach achieves high purity and yield of the separated metal and graphite while significantly reducing energy use, reagents, and operating costs compared with conventional recycling methods.








Abstract
The rising demand for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) highlights the urgent need for sustainable recycling technologies. Existing pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy methods can recover valuable metals but suffer from high energy costs and wastewater generation. Here, a selective flash Joule heating chlorination and oxidation (FJH&#8208;ClO) strategy is presented for the efficient separation of metals from spent batteries. In this process, cathode metals are first chlorinated for 60 s, after which the transition metal chlorides are oxidized to oxides, enabling lithium to be separated from transition metals due to their different aqueous solubility. This approach applies not only to the recovery of metals from lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode materials, but also to the anodic graphite, all from the black mass. The recovered graphite exhibits purity of &#8776;100% with a yield of 85%, Co at 99% purity and 97% yield, and Li at 99% purity with a 92% yield. Gram&#8208;scale experiments confirm the scalability of the method, maintaining high efficiency and selectivity. Life&#8208;cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis reveal that the FJH&#8208;ClO process substantially reduces energy consumption, operation time, and reagent consumption, while lowering operating costs by up to 92%, compared to conventional approaches.

         <title>Aqueous Sodium Humate Binder Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Voltage Cathodes via Protection from Interface to Bulk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eco&#8208;friendly and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) working as multifunctional binder enables high&#8208;performance for high&#8208;voltage cathodes. It is found that the proposed binder simultaneously stabilizes the interphase and bulk structure in high&#8208;voltage LCO via uniform surface coating and lattice&#8208;cognate in situ trace&#8208;level Na doping in the bulk during cycles, respectively.








Abstract
Raising the charging cutoff voltage is a well&#8208;established approach to enhance the energy density of LiCoO2 (LCO) cathodes, known for their high bulk energy density, in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical implementation under high&#8208;voltage conditions remains limited by interphase instability and bulk structural degradation. Herein, an innovative application of low&#8208;cost and water&#8208;soluble sodium humate (NaHA) is proposed, traditionally employed in aquaculture and pharmaceuticals, as a multifunctional binder for high&#8208;voltage LCO cathodes.

     alt="Aqueous Sodium Humate Binder Enabling Ultra-Stable High-Voltage Cathodes via Protection from Interface to Bulk"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eco-friendly and water-soluble sodium humate (NaHA) working as multifunctional binder enables high-performance for high-voltage cathodes. It is found that the proposed binder simultaneously stabilizes the interphase and bulk structure in high-voltage LCO via uniform surface coating and lattice-cognate in situ trace-level Na doping in the bulk during cycles, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raising the charging cutoff voltage is a well-established approach to enhance the energy density of LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO) cathodes, known for their high bulk energy density, in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical implementation under high-voltage conditions remains limited by interphase instability and bulk structural degradation. Herein, an innovative application of low-cost and water-soluble sodium humate (NaHA) is proposed, traditionally employed in aquaculture and pharmaceuticals, as a multifunctional binder for high-voltage LCO cathodes. Enriched with &#9472;COOH and &#9472;OH functional groups, NaHA not only forms robust hydrogen bonds with the LCO surface, enabling uniform coating on LCO particles, but also promotes a protective interphase microenvironment. More importantly, NaHA facilitates lattice-cognate in situ trace Na doping into the LCO bulk lattice during cycling, effectively enhancing its structural stability. This dual modification strategy, combining surface confinement and bulk reinforcement, endows LCO cathodes with ultra-stable electrochemical performance, retaining 95.1% capacity after 1700 cycles at 4.45&#160;V and 87.1% over 1000 cycles at 4.5&#160;V. Moreover, the water solubility of NaHA simplifies end-of-life electrode disassembly and promotes recyclability, supporting sustainable battery design. This binder-directed strategy offers a scalable, eco-friendly, and efficient binder-based stabilization route for high-voltage LCO cathodes, paving the way for the development of high-specific-energy LIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Structural and Defect Engineering in MoS2 Featuring Ultra&#8208;Expanded Interlayers for Fast&#8208;Chargeable and Long&#8208;Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
In this study, guided by theoretical insights, an innovative carbon&#8208;intercalated, Se&#8208;doped MoS2 encapsulated within hollow carbon spheres as a viable anode for Na&#8208;ion batteries has been developed, yielding synchronously a large reversible capacity, high&#8208;rate capability, and long&#8208;term durability. Its origins of the performance enhancement are explicitly revealed by extensive experimental characterizations and theoretical analyses.








Abstract
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) owing to its high theoretical specific capacity, yet it suffers from sluggish kinetics, severe volume variation, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Theoretically, concurrent selenium doping and carbon intercalation are revealed to effectively mitigate these challenges by improving electronic conductivity, promoting phase transition reaction kinetics, and alleviating structural deformation, thereby improving the structural flexibility of the MoS2 anode. Experimentally, a synergistic hollow carbon sphere&#8208;confined, carbon&#8208;intercalated and selenium&#8208;doped MoS2 (MoSSe@HCS) anode is rationally designed, achieving an ultra&#8208;expanded interlayer spacing (1.24&#160;nm), appropriate buffer space and robust carbon encapsulation. This design boosts charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, suppresses volume variation, and stabilizes SEI. Consequently, the MoSSe@HCS anode exhibits high capacity (441.5 mAh g&#8722;1, 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), exceptional rate capability (121.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1), and cyclability (87.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1). A full cell with Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode displays high&#8208;capacity retention of 82.1% after 600 cycles at 17 C and a pouch&#8208;type full cell sustains over 2500 cycles at 10 C, demonstrating significant commercial viability. This work establishes a theory&#8208;guided design paradigm that bridges fundamental understanding and practical deployment of high&#8208;performance MoS2&#8208;based anodes for next&#8208;generation SIBs.

         <title>Localized Electrostatic Interaction Stabilize Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a localized electrostatic interaction strategy using a tailored organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+), to enhance perovskite&#160;stability without introducing any trade&#8208;off. IDPA3+ induces perovskite lattice compression via sterically constrained localized electrostatic interactions, concurrently reinforcing structural stability while suppressing ion migration. Consequently, p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved&#160;a champion efficiency of 25.41% for 1.00 cm2 (certified 25.28%), alongside&#160;exceptional operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C and superior damp&#8208;heat stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for commercialization, yet the weak bonding nature of perovskites renders them vulnerable to external stimuli, undermining the operational longevity of PSCs. Methods aimed at strengthening bonding within perovskite constituents still failed to realize both &#8220;high efficiency&#8221; and &#8220;high stability&#8221; in single device. Herein, a localized electrostatic interaction strategy is proposed by employing an unexplored and well&#8208;designed organic cation, tetramethyldipropylene&#8208;triammonium (IDPA3+). IDPA3+ features sterically constrained multi&#8208;interaction sites that enable strong localized electrostatic interactions with [PbI6]4&#8722; octahedra, inducing perovskite lattice compression. This compression improves perovskite lattice energy through strengthened chemical bonding within bulk lattice, ultimately reinforcing structural stability while simultaneously suppressing ion migration. Consequently, modified formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) devices displayed state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stability, showing negligible performance loss under continuous operation at 85&#160;&#176;C and damp&#8208;heat test. Notably, the p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.28% for 1.00 cm2, among the highest published certified PCEs. Overall, this work presents localized electrostatic interaction engineering as a promising strategy to intrinsically stabilize perovskite microstructure, bridging the gap between electrostatic regulation and structural stability while highlighting the broader potential of other triply&#8208;charged organic molecules for advancing stable PSCs and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Spin&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme Overcomes the Activity&#8208;Selectivity Trade&#8208;Off for Sustainable Adhesive Production From Lignin Biomass Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the multispin&#8208;state characteristics of natural laccase's multicopper centers, a 2D copper&#8208;based MOF is developed with optimal laccase&#8208;like activity, named COHBLO. This nanozyme selectively degrades lignin into uniform, hydroxyl&#8208;rich products. Through a ring&#8208;opening reaction between the hydroxyl and epoxy groups, a high&#8208;strength, eco&#8208;friendly lignin&#8208;based wood adhesive is successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lignin, a major component of plant cell walls, is the most abundant source of natural aromatic polymers. Efficient production of its valuable degradation products requires highly selective catalysts. This study introduces a spin&#8208;state&#8208;modulated nanozyme system for precise lignin depolymerization into targeted biobased chemicals. Precise copper spin state control in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) copper&#8208;based metal organic framework (MOF) nanozymes, achieved via redox treatment and ligand exchange modulation, replicates natural laccase multicopper center spin synergy. Integrated experiments and theory reveal a volcano&#8208;shaped spin state&#8208;activity correlation, enabling synthesis of optimized nanozyme Cu(OH)2BDC&#8208;LA&#8208;OAc (COHBLO). This material demonstrates exceptional laccase&#8208;mimicking activity, with a peak reaction rate 70 times higher than natural laccase and a 5.14&#8208;fold specific activity increase. Through laccase&#8208;like catalysis, it selectively cleaves lignin &#946;&#8208;O&#8208;4 linkages, directionally yielding fragments rich in phenolic hydroxyl groups. Their efficient reaction with epoxy groups produces a nanolignin&#8208;based epoxy adhesive. Featuring a three&#8208;dimensional cross&#8208;linked network, this adhesive delivers superior bonding under varied conditions. Its shear strength significantly surpasses commercial phenolic resins while eliminating conventional adhesive formaldehyde emissions. This study advances 2D MOF nanozyme design and establishes an integrated pathway from controlled lignin depolymerization to high&#8208;performance adhesive production, providing key theoretical and practical foundations for biomass valorization and sustainable adhesive development.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Dependent Reverse Electronic Metal&#8208;Support Interaction to Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;dependent universal law of electron transfer is investigated by depositing metals onto the surfaces of monolayer 1T&#8208;/2H&#8208;MoS2 hollow structures. The reverse transfer of electrons from 1T&#8208;MoS2 to metal demonstrates superior electrochemical activity and long&#8208;term stability in hydrogen evolution reactions compared to the forward transfer of electrons from metal to 2H&#8208;MoS2.








Abstract
Electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) represents a pivotal strategy for modulating the electronic structure of supported metals and enhancing their catalytic performance. However, limited reports have been conducted on the impact of the support crystal phase on EMSI. Here, a charge transfer inversion phenomenon associated with support crystal phase regulation is systematically revealed. Specifically, subnano&#8208;sized noble metals (e.g., Pt, Rh, Ru) donate electrons to 2H&#8208;MoS2 support, whereas a reverse electron transfer direction is observed when these noble metals are supported on 1T&#8208;MoS2. Electron&#8208;enriched noble metals demonstrate significantly higher activity for alkaline hydrogen evolution compared to their electron&#8208;deficient counterparts, with 1T&#8208;MoS2@Pt achieving an exceptionally low overpotential of 18&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) incorporating 1T&#8208;MoS2@Pt as the cathode exhibits superior catalytic activity and sustained stability at ampere&#8208;level current density. This work provides novel insights into developing efficient catalysts by regulating charge transfer dependent on the support crystal phase.

         <title>Reactivity&#8208;Driven Metal&#8208;Adaptive Interphases for Dendrite&#8208;Free, High&#8208;Rate Alkali Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a universal strategy to reconstruct hierarchical, metal&#8208;adaptive SEI layers on Li/Na anodes (TC&#8208;Li/TC&#8208;Na) and address their metal&#8208;specific limitations. Guided by distinct reaction kinetics, a low&#8208;porosity, high&#8208;modulus layer is formed on TC&#8208;Li to mechanically suppress dendrites, while a highly porous network with interconnected ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles is constructed on TC&#8208;Na to accommodate volumetric strain and enhance interfacial activity. Consequently, the modified Li/Na metal pouch cells deliver improved long&#8208;term stability and rate capability, and achieve a stable operation under a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, high&#8208;capacity Li metal pouch cell (550.2 Wh kg&#8722;1, 11.1 Ah) and a high&#8208;rate Na metal pouch cell (0.3 C/1 C).








Abstract
Alkali metal anodes (e.g., Li and Na) require a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) customized to their physicomechanical and electrochemical demands; however, conventional SEI designs relying on generic &#8220;one&#8208;size&#8208;fits&#8208;all&#8221; approaches fail to fully address the metal&#8208;specific requirements. Herein, a metal&#8208;adaptive SEI reconstruction strategy is proposed to leverage the reactivity&#8208;guided diisopropoxy&#8208;bisethylacetoacetatotitanate (DPBT) coatings on alkali metal anodes (TC&#8208;Li/TC&#8208;Na). The resulting interphases both share a hierarchical architecture with an ultrathin titanate layer and a TiO2&#8208;based inner matrix connected through compositionally graded segments (Ti&#8211;O&#8211;M, M = Li/Na/C), yet demonstrate metal&#8208;specific structural differentiation. The moderate reactivity of Li facilitates the dense packing of larger TiO2 nanoparticles, forming a low&#8208;porosity, high&#8208;modulus layer that mechanically suppresses dendrites. Conversely, the more rapid reaction of Na instantly produces abundant gas bubbles and fosters a highly porous network with interconnected ultrasmall TiO2 nanoparticles, integrating moderate modulus with elevated surface roughness that dynamically accommodates volumetric strain and enhances interfacial activity. Consequently, the NCM811||TC&#8208;Li pouch cell achieves high&#8208;capacity retention (89.3%, 200 cycles, 456.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) under 0.2 C/0.5 C and stable operation under high capacity and high energy density of 11.1 Ah and 550.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, while NFM||TC&#8208;Na pouch cell deliveries exceptional cycling stability at 0.3 C/1 C (79.7% retention over 200 cycles).

         <title>Steric&#8208;Hindrance Effect Induced Fabrication of Lightweight, Bi&#8208;Functional, and Easy&#8208;to&#8208;Infiltrate Hosts for 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

The fabrication of abundant bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;doping sites on easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate hosts has been successfully realized for the first time. This breakthrough has facilitated the achievement of an ultralight, efficiently bi&#8208;functional and easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host, enabling a pouch lithium&#8208;sulfur battery (&#8776;2 Ah) to exhibit an impressive energy density of 502 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cyclic stability.








Abstract
A promising strategy for constructing 500&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 cell&#8208;level rechargeable lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is developing hosts with ultralight weight to reduce nonactive mass, bi&#8208;functionality to ensure both efficient sulfur reactions and lithium plating under low N/P, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate architecture for full wetting with lean electrolyte. Edge&#8208;doped carbons, combining light weight and unique bi&#8208;functionality, are rare candidates as such hosts. However, their preparation, which generally involves increasing specific surface areas or forming micropores/mesopores, impairs host&#8208;wetting under lean electrolyte. Herein, a steric&#8208;hindrance&#8208;induced approach is pioneered to create abundant edge&#8208;doping&#8208;sites on an easy&#8208;to&#8208;infiltrate host of carbon nanofibers (CNF). Boron&#8208;containing carbon dots (BCDs) are elaborately utilized as heteroatom&#8208;introducing agents. Their organic nature facilitates uniform integration of graft&#8208;like BCD units, while their inorganic crystalline cores suppress graphitization of CNF precursors surrounding these graft&#8208;like units via steric&#8208;hindrance during carbonization, promoting bi&#8208;functional edge&#8208;B&#8208;doping sites formation. Such a host enables 2 Ah pouch&#8208;type LSBs to achieve an impressive energy density of 502&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with enhanced cyclic stability.

         <title>Molecular Tailoring of Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers via Polar Ether Linker for Highly Efficient and Mechanically Robust Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a polar ether&#8208;functionalized self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced to enhance the efficiency and durability of flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). Rational linker engineering enables dense and uniform SAM coverage, strengthens interfacial adhesion, and facilitates efficient hole extraction. As a result, inverted f&#8208;PSCs deliver 25.11% efficiency (certified 24.59%) and retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation portable, wearable, and building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics. However, conventional self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules often exhibit weak interfacial binding and limited mechanical coupling, leading to incomplete coverage and poor contact on rough flexible substrates. Here, a molecularly tailored SAM design is presented that addresses these challenges through rational linker engineering. Replacing common alkyl chains with a polar ether linker modulates the electron density around the phosphonic acid anchoring group, while the ether oxygen atom acts as an effective&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bond acceptor. This dual functionality promotes Et2OPACz to assemble into a dense, uniform layer on flexible substrates, thereby strengthening interfacial adhesion, improving perovskite film quality, and facilitating hole extraction. As a result, f&#8208;PSCs incorporating Et2OPACz SAM achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.11% (certified 24.59%), among the highly reported for f&#8208;PSCs. The devices retain 94% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of continuous operation and 92.6% after 5000 bending cycles at a radius of 3&#160;mm. These results demonstrate that polar ether linker engineering provides a powerful strategy to simultaneously optimize interfacial contact, charge transport, and mechanical durability in high&#8208;performance f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Toward Standardized Evaluation of PFAS Sorbents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 7, 2 February 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective highlights the need for consistent reporting standards in PFAS sorbent research. It proposes a structured framework encompassing sorbent characterization, water matrix and PFAS details, and sorption&#8211;regeneration performance (including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation). The guidelines aim to improve transparency, reproducibility, and comparability, thereby accelerating the development of effective PFAS remediation technologies.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent environmental contaminants with global distribution and documented risks to human and environmental health. Sorbent&#8208;based technologies are widely explored for PFAS removal, yet the advancement of this field is impeded by inconsistent and incomplete experimental reporting, hindering reproducibility and comparative analysis.&#160;In this perspective, a structured framework is presented to guide the comprehensive characterization when reporting of new PFAS sorbents. The proposed framework defines three essential domains for experimental evaluation: i) sorbent characterization, ii) water matrix specification and PFAS details, and iii) sorption and regeneration performance, including flow&#8208;through packed&#8208;bed evaluation (both bench&#8208; and pilot&#8208;scales). General guidelines are provided for each domain to promote consistency, transparency, and comparability across studies. This Perspective aims to facilitate rigorous cross&#8208;study comparison and accelerate the development of effective PFAS sorbents.

&lt;p&gt;This perspective highlights the need for consistent reporting standards in PFAS sorbent research. It proposes a structured framework encompassing sorbent characterization, water matrix and PFAS details, and sorption&#8211;regeneration performance (including flow-through packed-bed evaluation). The guidelines aim to improve transparency, reproducibility, and comparability, thereby accelerating the development of effective PFAS remediation technologies.
