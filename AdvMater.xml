         <title>Enabling Atomic&#8208;Scale Imaging of Sensitive Potassium Metal and Related Solid Electrolyte Interphases Using Ultralow&#8208;Dose Cryo&#8208;TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic structure of K dendrites and their solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is studied using ultralow dosage cryo&#8208;TEM. The inorganic SEI components are surprisingly large and are coherently patched together in a tessellated parquetry floor&#8208;tile fashion. Triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based electrolytes induce the formation of KPO3 in the SEI, enhancing the cycling life; while vinylene carbonate (VC) additive generates products such as KCO3, causing the battery's failure.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;based solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) have a much smaller damage threshold than their lithium counterpart; thus, they are significantly more beam sensitive. Here, an ultralow&#8208;dose cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;TEM) technique (&#8776;8 e &#197;&#8722;2 s&#8722;1&#160;&#215; 10 s), which enables the atomic&#8208;scale chemical imaging of the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive potassium metal and SEI in its native state, is adapted. The potassium&#8208;based SEI consists of large brackets of diverse inorganic phases (&#8776;hundreds of nanometers) interspersed with amorphous phases, which are different from the tiny nanocrystalline inorganic phases (&#8776;a few nanometers) formed in a lithium&#8208;based SEI. Organic phosphate&#8208;based electrolyte solvents induce the formation of a thin and stable SEI layer for enhanced cycling performance, while the carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes result in large quantities of metastable KHCO3, and K4CO4 products in the SEI, depleting the potassium reserves in the battery. The findings provide deep insights and guidance in the selection of optimum electrolytes that should be used for potassium batteries.

         <title>From Molecules to Frameworks to Superframework Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic approach is presented to build macroscopic structures with the same precision applied in molecular chemistry. Molecules are linked into frameworks, and crystals of frameworks are in turn linked into superframeworks, an escalation of building blocks from molecules to crystals. This strategy is termed augmented reticular chemistry, from where new frontiers of photonics, dynamics, and systems chemistry emerge.








Abstract
Building chemical structures of complexity and functionality approaching the level of biological systems is an ongoing challenge. A general synthetic strategy is proposed by which progressive levels of complexity are achieved through the building block approach whereby molecularly defined constructs at one level serve as constituent units of the next level, all being linked through strong bonds&#8212;&#8221;augmented reticular chemistry&#8221;. Specifically, current knowledge of linking metal complexes and organic molecules into reticular frameworks is applied here to linking the crystals of these frameworks into supercrystals (superframeworks). This strategy allows for the molecular control exercised on the molecular regime to be translated into higher augmentation levels to produce systems capable of dynamics and complex functionality far exceeding current materials.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Charge Interconversion in KTaO3 2D Electron Gases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D electron gases formed by sputtering a thin film of Al onto KTaO3 crystals are used to interconvert charge and spin currents with a high efficiency, thanks to the large Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling in the electron gas. These results are relevant for the integration of quantum oxide materials into spintronics devices.








Abstract
Oxide interfaces exhibit a broad range of physical effects stemming from broken inversion symmetry. In particular, they can display non&#8208;reciprocal phenomena when time reversal symmetry is also broken, e.g., by the application of a magnetic field. Examples include the direct and inverse Edelstein effects (DEE, IEE) that allow the interconversion between spin currents and charge currents. The DEE and IEE have been investigated in interfaces based on the perovskite SrTiO3 (STO), albeit in separate studies focusing on one or the other. The demonstration of these effects remains mostly elusive in other oxide interface systems despite their blossoming in the last decade. Here, the observation of both the DEE and IEE in a new interfacial two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEG) based on the perovskite oxide KTaO3 is reported. 2DEGs are generated by the simple deposition of Al metal onto KTaO3 single crystals, characterized by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and magnetotransport, and shown to display the DEE through unidirectional magnetoresistance and the IEE by spin&#8208;pumping experiments. Their spin&#8211;charge interconversion efficiency is then compared with that of STO&#8208;based interfaces, related to the 2DEG electronic structure, and perspectives are given for the implementation of KTaO3 2DEGs into spin&#8211;orbitronic devices is compared.

         <title>Tunable Photoresponsive Behaviors Based on Triphenylamine Derivatives: The Pivotal Role of &#960;&#8208;Conjugated Structure and Corresponding Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of tunable photoresponsive material from photoactivated phosphorescence to photochromism is developed through doping triarylamine derivatives with different aryl substituents into a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. Accordingly, they are conveniently applied in rewritable photopatterning, anticounterfeiting, information encryption, and sunglasses.








Abstract
Photoresponsive materials have drawn much attention and are widely applied in daily life for their reversible changes in luminous color or appearance color under light irradiation. In this work, a new photoresponsive system based on triarylamine derivatives is developed. With the changed aryl substituents, adjustable photoresponsive properties, including photoactivated phosphorescence and photochromism after being dispersed into the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix, are demonstrated. According to the theoretical calculations and experimental data, the competition between the formations of triplet excitons and cationic radicals under photoirradiation should be the main reason for their different photoresponsive properties. Excitingly, the applications of rewritable photopatterning, anticounterfeiting, information encryption, and decryption are realized conveniently, in addition to the successful model of sunglasses to protect eyes away from ultraviolet radiation and strong light in the sunlight. These studies present a simple and efficient design strategy for the development of photoresponsive materials on modulating the phosphorescence and photochromic property.

         <title>Viscoelasticity and Adhesion Signaling in Biomaterials Control Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Morphogenesis in 3D Culture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have tremendous potential for use in regenerative medicine, but it is a challenge to control hiPSC morphogenesis and sustain pluripotency in 3D culture. Using hydrogels for 3D culture of hiPSCs, hydrogel viscoelasticity and adhesion ligand density are shown to regulate growth and lumen formation of hiPSCs while supporting pluripotency.








Abstract
Organoids are lumen&#8208;containing multicellular structures that recapitulate key features of the organs, and are increasingly used in models of disease, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. Recent work has used 3D culture models to form organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) matrices. However, rBM matrices offer little control over the microenvironment. More generally, the role of matrix viscoelasticity in directing lumen formation remains unknown. Here, viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with independently tunable stress relaxation (viscoelasticity), stiffness, and arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartate (RGD) ligand density are used to study hiPSC morphogenesis in 3D&#160;culture. A phase diagram that shows how these properties control hiPSC morphogenesis is reported. Higher RGD density and fast stress relaxation promote hiPSC viability, proliferation, apicobasal polarization, and lumen formation, while slow stress relaxation at low RGD densities triggers hiPSC apoptosis. Notably, hiPSCs maintain pluripotency in alginate hydrogels for much longer times than is reported in rBM matrices. Lumen formation is regulated by actomyosin contractility and is accompanied by translocation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The results reveal matrix viscoelasticity as a potent factor regulating stem cell morphogenesis and provide new insights into how engineered biomaterials may be leveraged to build organoids.

&lt;p&gt;Organoids are lumen-containing multicellular structures that recapitulate key features of the organs, and are increasingly used in models of disease, drug testing, and regenerative medicine. Recent work has used 3D culture models to form organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) in reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) matrices. However, rBM matrices offer little control over the microenvironment. More generally, the role of matrix viscoelasticity in directing lumen formation remains unknown. Here, viscoelastic alginate hydrogels with independently tunable stress relaxation (viscoelasticity), stiffness, and arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartate (RGD) ligand density are used to study hiPSC morphogenesis in 3D&#160;culture. A phase diagram that shows how these properties control hiPSC morphogenesis is reported. Higher RGD density and fast stress relaxation promote hiPSC viability, proliferation, apicobasal polarization, and lumen formation, while slow stress relaxation at low RGD densities triggers hiPSC apoptosis. Notably, hiPSCs maintain pluripotency in alginate hydrogels for much longer times than is reported in rBM matrices. Lumen formation is regulated by actomyosin contractility and is accompanied by translocation of Yes-associated protein (YAP) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The results reveal matrix viscoelasticity as a potent factor regulating stem cell morphogenesis and provide new insights into how engineered biomaterials may be leveraged to build organoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication of GaN/Diamond Heterointerface and Interfacial Chemical Bonding State for Highly Efficient Device Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of a GaN/diamond heterointerface is successfully achieved by a surface&#8208;activated bonding method at room temperature. A 5.3 nm&#8208;thick intermediate layer composed of amorphous carbon and diamond is formed at the as&#8208;bonded heterointerface. After annealing at 1000&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of the intermediate layer is decreased to &#8776;1.5&#160;nm, where lattice fringes of the diamond(220) plane are observed.








Abstract
The direct integration of gallium nitride (GaN) and diamond holds much promise for high&#8208;power devices. However, it is a big challenge to grow GaN on diamond due to the large lattice and thermal&#8208;expansion coefficient mismatch between GaN and diamond. In this work, the fabrication of a GaN/diamond heterointerface is successfully achieved by a surface activated bonding (SAB) method at room temperature. A small compressive stress exists in the GaN/diamond heterointerface, which is significantly smaller than that of the GaN&#8208;on&#8208;diamond structure with a transition layer formed by crystal growth. A 5.3 nm&#8208;thick intermediate layer composed of amorphous carbon and diamond is formed at the as&#8208;bonded heterointerface. Ga and N atoms are distributed in the intermediate layer by diffusion during the bonding process. Both the thickness and the sp2&#8208;bonded carbon ratio of the intermediate layer decrease as the annealing temperature increases, which indicates that the amorphous carbon is directly converted into diamond after annealing. The diamond of the intermediate layer acts as a seed crystal. After annealing at 1000 &#176;C, the thickness of the intermediate layer is decreased to approximately 1.5 nm, where lattice fringes of the diamond (220) plane are observed.

         <title>Photoresponsive and Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Structural Colors from Cellulose/Liquid Crystal Nanophotonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization&#8208;sensitive and photoresponsive nanophotonic system based on structural colors that are generated by cellulose nanocrystal films and modulated by a birefringent liquid crystal coating is presented. Intense structural colors are appealingly varied by altering the handedness of the illuminating circularly polarized light. The system is further made photoresponsive using a UV&#8208;light&#8208;sensitive liquid crystal mixture.








Abstract
Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) possess the ability to form helical periodic structures that generate structural colors. Due to the helicity, such self&#8208;assembled cellulose structures preferentially reflect left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light of certain colors, while they remain transparent to right&#8208;handed circularly polarized light. This study shows that combination with a liquid crystal enables modulation of the optical response to obtain light reflection of both handedness but with reversed spectral profiles. As a result, the nanophotonic systems provide vibrant structural colors that are tunable via the incident light polarization. The results are attributed to the liquid crystal aligning on the CNC/glucose film, to form a birefringent layer that twists the incident light polarization before interaction with the chiral cellulose nanocomposite. Using a photoresponsive liquid crystal, this effect can further be turned off by exposure to UV light, which switches the nematic liquid crystal into a nonbirefringent isotropic phase. The study highlights the potential of hybrid cellulose systems to create self&#8208;assembled yet advanced photoresponsive and polarization&#8208;tunable nanophotonics.

         <title>Chiral Phonons and Giant Magneto&#8208;Optical Effect in CrBr3 2D Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in CrBr3 2D magnet are reported. The superposition of doubly degenerate Eg modes results in chiral phonons with PAM of l&#160;=&#160;&#177;1, exhibiting isotropic linearly polarized Raman scattering. The non&#8208;degenerate Ag modes display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light.








Abstract
Phonons with chirality determine the optical helicity of inelastic light scattering processes due to their nonzero angular momentum. Here it is shown that 2D magnetic CrBr3 hosts chiral phonons at the Brillouin&#8208;zone center. These chiral phonons are linear combinations of the doubly&#8208;degenerate Eg phonons, and the phonon eigenmodes exhibit clockwise and counterclockwise rotational vibrations corresponding to angular momenta of l = &#177; 1.&#160;Such Eg chiral phonons completely switch the polarization of incident circularly polarized light. On the other hand, the non&#8208;degenerate non&#8208;chiral Ag phonons display a giant magneto&#8208;optical effect under an external out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic field, rotating the plane of polarization of the scattered linearly polarized light. The corresponding degree of polarization of the scattered light changes from 91% to &#8722;68% as the magnetic field strength increases from 0 to 5 T. In contrast, the chiral Eg modes display no field dependence. The results lay a foundation for the study of phonon chirality and magneto&#8208;optical phenomena in 2D magnetic materials, as well as their related applications, such as the phonon Hall effect, topological photonics, and Raman lasing.

         <title>Machine Learning to Predict Quasicrystals from Chemical Compositions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasicrystals are long&#8208;range ordered materials that exhibit rotational symmetries disallowed for periodic crystals. Since the first discovery of a quasicrystal in 1984, 100 or so thermodynamically stable quasicrystals have been found, but the pace of the discovery has been slowing down significantly in recent years. Machine&#8208;learning technologies open up the door to the accelerated discovery of new quasicrystals.








Abstract
Quasicrystals have emerged as the third class of solid&#8208;state materials, distinguished from periodic crystals and amorphous solids, which have long&#8208;range order without periodicity exhibiting rotational symmetries that are disallowed for periodic crystals in most cases. To date, more than one hundred stable quasicrystals have been reported, leading to the discovery of many new and exciting phenomena. However, the pace of the discovery of new quasicrystals has lowered in recent years, largely owing to the lack of clear guiding principles for the synthesis of new quasicrystals. Here, it is shown that the discovery of new quasicrystals can be accelerated with a simple machine&#8208;learning workflow. With a list of the chemical compositions of known stable quasicrystals, approximant crystals, and ordinary crystals, a prediction model is trained to solve the three&#8208;class classification task and its predictability compared to the observed phase diagrams of ternary aluminum systems is evaluated. The validation experiments strongly support the superior predictive power of machine learning, with the overall prediction accuracy of the phase prediction task reaching &#8776;0.728. Furthermore, analyzing the input&#8211;output relationships black&#8208;boxed into the model, nontrivial empirical equations interpretable by humans that describe conditions necessary for stable quasicrystal formation are&#160;identified.

An interesting paradigm of oxygen&#8208;irrelevant photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) via near&#8208;IR&#8208;gated and H2O&#8208;mediated photocleavage based on engineered yolk&#8211;shell upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticle nanomedicines to augment the therapeutic efficacy of PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment is reported.








Abstract
The oxygen&#8208;dependent nature and limited penetration capacity of visible light render the low efficiency of photodynamic therapy in hypoxic and deep&#8208;seated tumors. Therefore, the development of oxygen&#8208;free photoactivated chemotherapy (PACT) to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species by near&#8208;IR (NIR) light&#8208;cleavable photocages is in high demand. Here, an oxygen&#8208;irrelevant PACT strategy based on NIR light&#8208;triggered hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generation is developed for free&#8208;radical nanotherapy. Blebbistatin&#8208;loaded upconversion of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (UCSNs&#8208;B) is established to facilitate the high loading efficiency of blebbistatin and implement the efficient transformation of NIR light into blue light for unprecedented direct photorelease of oxygen&#8208;independent &#8226;OH. Under NIR laser irradiation, UCSNs&#8208;B converted NIR light into blue light, thus enabling the photocleavage of blebbistatin to induce the burst of &#8226;OH. The &#8226;OH burst under NIR laser irradiation further induces cancer cell apoptosis and significant suppression of hypoxic tumors. In addition, the gadolinium ion (Gd3+)&#8208;doped UCSNs&#8208;B are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging to facilitate real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic processes. This study effectively demonstrates that the UCSNs&#8208;B act as NIR light&#8208;triggered photocages to facilitate oxygen&#8208;irrelevant &#8226;OH bursts, thus providing insights into the development of efficient PACT nanoagents for cancer treatment.

         <title>Controlling Surface Wettability for Automated In Situ Array Synthesis and Direct Bioscreening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic coating for glass surfaces is reported, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.








Abstract
The in situ synthesis of biomolecules on glass surfaces for direct bioscreening can be a powerful tool in the fields of pharmaceutical sciences, biomaterials, and chemical biology. However, it is still challenging to 1) achieve this conventional multistep combinatorial synthesis on glass surfaces with small feature sizes and high yields and 2) develop a surface which is compatible with solid&#8208;phase syntheses, as well as the subsequent bioscreening. This work reports an amphiphilic coating of a glass surface on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle and inhibited motion to permit fully automated multiple rounds of the combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. This amphiphilic coating can be switched into a hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening. Employing this in situ synthesis method, chemical space can be probed via array technology with unprecedented speed for various applications, such as lead discovery/optimization in medicinal chemistry and biomaterial development.

         <title>Production of Multiple Cell&#8208;Laden Microtissue Spheroids with a Biomimetic Hepatic&#8208;Lobule&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A technique for producing multicellular microtissue spheroids using bioprinting and a microfluidic emulsification system is presented. Spheroids with the biomimetic structure of liver lobules are produced with high throughput and uniform size. The spheroids with biomimetic structure show enhanced functionalities and stable structural integrity. In addition, the in vivo study reveals enhanced engraftment potential of the structured spheroids.








Abstract
The construction of an in vitro 3D cellular model to mimic the human liver is highly desired for drug discovery and clinical applications, such as patient&#8208;specific treatment and cell&#8208;based therapy in regenerative medicine. However, current bioprinting strategies are limited in their ability to generate multiple cell&#8208;laden microtissues with biomimetic structures. This study presents a method for producing hepatic&#8208;lobule&#8208;like microtissue spheroids using a bioprinting system incorporating a precursor cartridge and microfluidic emulsification system. The multiple cell&#8208;laden microtissue spheroids can be successfully generated at a speed of approximately 45 spheroids min&#8722;1 and with a uniform diameter. Hepatic and endothelial cells are patterned in a microtissue spheroid with the biomimetic structure of a liver lobule. The spheroids allow long&#8208;term culture with high cell viability, and the structural integrity is maintained longer than that of non&#8208;structured spheroids. Furthermore, structured spheroids show high MRP2, albumin, and CD31 expression levels. In addition, the in vivo study reveals that structured microtissue spheroids are stably engrafted. These results demonstrate that the method provides a valuable 3D structured microtissue spheroid model with lobule&#8208;like constructs and liver functions.

         <title>Electric Field Control of the Magnetic Weyl Fermion in an Epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) Thin Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is achieved in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) film, the topological property of which is identified with the help of magnetotransport measurements, angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and first&#8208;principles calculations.








Abstract
The magnetic Weyl fermion originates from the time reversal symmetry (TRS)&#8208;breaking in magnetic crystalline structures, where the topology and magnetism entangle with each other. Therefore, the magnetic Weyl fermion is expected to be effectively tuned by the magnetic field and electrical field, which holds promise for future topologically protected electronics. However, the electrical field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion has rarely been reported, which is prevented by the limited number of identified magnetic Weyl solids. Here, the electric field control of the magnetic Weyl fermion is demonstrated in an epitaxial SrRuO3 (111) thin film. The magnetic Weyl fermion in the SrRuO3 films is indicated by the chiral anomaly induced magnetotransport, and is verified by the observed Weyl nodes in the electronic structures characterized by the angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first&#8208;principles calculations. Through the ionic&#8208;liquid gating experiment, the effective manipulation of the Weyl fermion by electric field is demonstrated, in terms of the sign&#8208;change of the ordinary Hall effect, the nonmonotonic tuning of the anomalous Hall effect, and the observation of the linear magnetoresistance under proper gating voltages. The work may stimulate the searching and tuning of Weyl fermions in other magnetic materials, which are promising in energy&#8208;efficient electronics.

         <title>A Universal Compensation Strategy to Anchor Polar Organic Molecules in Bilayered Hydrated Vanadates for Promoting Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal compensation strategy is reported to introduce polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. Owing to the high&#8208;polar carbonyl/sulfenyl and low&#8208;polar alkyl, the organic molecules display a strong interaction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+ and a weak interaction with Zn2+. Consequently, the cathode displays superior structural stability and ion transfer kinetics, leading to excellent performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical performance of layered vanadium oxides is often improved by introducing guest species into their interlayer. Guest species with high stability in the interlayer and weak interaction with Zn2+ during charge/discharge process are desired to promoting reversible Zn2+ transfer. Herein, a universal compensation strategy was&#160;developed to introduce various polar organic molecules into the interlayer of AlxV2O5&#183;nH2O by replacing partial crystal water. The high&#8208;polar groups in the organic molecules have a strong electrostatic attraction with pre&#8208;intercalated Al3+, which ensures that organic molecules can be anchored in the interlayer of hydrated vanadates. Simultaneously, the low&#8208;polar groups endow organic molecules with a weak interaction with Zn2+ during cycling, thus liberalizing reversible Zn2+ transfer. As a result, AlxV2O5 with polar organic molecules displays enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, based on above cathode material, a pouch cell was&#160;assembled by further integrating a dendrite&#8208;free N&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber@Zn anode, displaying an energy density of 50&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1. This work provides a path for designing stable guest species with a weak interaction with Zn2+ in the interlayer of layered vanadium oxide towards high&#8208;performance cathode materials of aqueous Zn batteries.

Owing to the high-polar carbonyl/sulfenyl and low-polar alkyl, the organic molecules display a strong interaction with pre-intercalated Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and a weak interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, the cathode displays superior structural stability and ion transfer kinetics, leading to excellent performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical performance of layered vanadium oxides is often improved by introducing guest species into their interlayer. Guest species with high stability in the interlayer and weak interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during charge/discharge process are desired to promoting reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer. Herein, a universal compensation strategy was&#160;developed to introduce various polar organic molecules into the interlayer of Al&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O by replacing partial crystal water. The high-polar groups in the organic molecules have a strong electrostatic attraction with pre-intercalated Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, which ensures that organic molecules can be anchored in the interlayer of hydrated vanadates. Simultaneously, the low-polar groups endow organic molecules with a weak interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; during cycling, thus liberalizing reversible Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer. As a result, Al&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; with polar organic molecules displays enhanced electrochemical performance. Furthermore, based on above cathode material, a pouch cell was&#160;assembled by further integrating a dendrite-free N-doped carbon nanofiber@Zn anode, displaying an energy density of 50&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work provides a path for designing stable guest species with a weak interaction with Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the interlayer of layered vanadium oxide towards high-performance cathode materials of aqueous Zn batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Side Area&#8208;Assisted 3D Evaporator with Antibiofouling Function for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber is explored. The SISG system exhibits a high solar evaporation rate of 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and shows photodynamic killing of bacteria to prevent biofouling.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial steam generation (SISG) has been recognized as a promising strategy to solve water shortages in an eco&#8208;friendly and low&#8208;cost way. However, the practical application of SISG is vitally restricted by some inherent limits, especially for finite evaporation rate and insufficient working life of evaporator. Herein, a novel SISG system involving an all&#8208;fiber porous cylinder&#8208;like foam 3D evaporator, side area&#8208;assisted evaporation protocol, and aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission&#8208;active solar absorber with &#8220;one stone two birds&#8221; function is explored. The solar absorber exhibits efficient photothermal conversion, endowing the side area&#8208;assisted evaporator with as high as 3.6&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 of solar evaporation rate, which is highly desirable for SISG under 1 sun of irradiation. Moreover, the solar absorber is capable of powerfully producing reactive oxygen species upon sunlight irradiation, which results in extraordinary photodynamic killing of bacteria nearby the fiber to prevent biofouling, consequently improving the working life of evaporator.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Ni2P/Ni Catalysts for Selective Solar&#8208;Driven CO Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported Ni2P/Ni nanoparticle catalysts, obtained through a facile gas&#8211;solid reaction strategy, show a remarkable C2+ selectivity of 70% for solar&#8208;driven CO hydrogenation. Conversely, CO methanation is the dominant process for metallic Ni nanoparticles in the absence of Ni2P. The results reveal a simple phosphidation strategy for tuning the selectivity of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO hydrogenation to value&#8208;added hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) holds great potential for the sustainable production of fuels from syngas and solar energy. However, the selectivity toward multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is often hampered by the difficulty in the regulation of transition metals acting as both light absorption units and active sites. Herein, a partial phosphidation strategy to prepare titania supported Ni2P/Ni catalysts for photothermal FTS is demonstrated. Under Xenon lamp or concentrated sunlight irradiation, the optimized catalyst shows a C2+ selectivity of 70% at a CO conversion of &gt;20%.&#160;Conversely, nickel metal in the absence of Ni2P delivers negligible C2+ products (&#8776;1%) with methane being the major product (&gt;90%). Structural characterization and density functional theory calculation reveal that the partial phosphidation allows exposed metallic Ni to be active for CO adsorption and activation, while the existence of Ni2P/Ni interface is responsible to inhibit CO methanation and promote C&#8211;C coupling of adsorbed *CH intermediates. This work introduces a novel phosphidation strategy for nickel&#8208;based photothermal catalysts in efficiently harnessing solar energy, and regulating the reaction pathways for CO hydrogenation to deliver high value products.

         <title>A Robust Narrow Bandgap Vanadium Tetrasulfide Sonosensitizer Optimized by Charge Separation Engineering for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium tetrasulfide is presented as a new generation of robust narrow&#8208;bandgap sonosensitizer for sonodynamic therapy. The charge separation engineering strategy is also demonstrated to be highly efficient in optimizing its sono&#8208;catalytic performance. Besides, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to achieve an excellent tumor therapeutic effect.








Abstract
The development and optimization of sonosensitizers for elevating intratumoral reactive oxygen species (ROS) are definitely appealing in current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Given this, branched vanadium tetrasulfide (VS4) nanodendrites with a narrower bandgap (compared with the most extensively explored sonosensitizers) are presented as a new source of sonosensitizer, which allows a more effortless separation of sono&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole pairs for ROS generation. Specifically, platinum (Pt) nanoparticles and endogenous high levels of glutathione (GSH) are rationally engineered to further optimize its sono&#8208;sensitized performance. As cocatalyst, Pt is conducive to trapping electrons, whereas GSH, as a natural hole&#8208;scavenger, tends to capture holes. Compared with the pristine VS4 sonosensitizer, the GSH&#8208;Pt&#8208;VS4 nanocomposite can greatly prolong the lifetime of the charge and confer a highly efficacious ROS production activity. Furthermore, such nanoplatforms are capable of reshaping tumor microenvironments to realize ROS overproduction, contributed by overcoming tumor hypoxia to improve SDT&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, catalyzing endogenic hydrogen peroxide into destructive hydroxyl radicals for chemodynamic therapy, and depleting GSH to amplify intratumoral oxidative stress. All these combined effects result in a significantly efficient tumor suppression outcome. This study enriches sonosensitizer research and proves that sonosensitizers can be rationally optimized by charge separation engineering strategy.

         <title>A Magneto&#8208;Heated Ferrimagnetic Sponge for Continuous Recovery of Viscous Crude Oil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferrimagnetic sponge with the skeletons coated with poly(dimethylsiloxane) and iron oxide nanoparticles is developed to achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil. Under the exposure of an alternating magnetic field, the viscosity of the viscous oil around the sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating its absorption.








Abstract
The high viscosity and low fluidity of heavy crude oil hinder its sorption by conventional porous sorbents, so the efficient clean&#8208;up of such heavy crude oil spills is challenging. Recently, Joule heating has been emerging as a new tool to reduce the viscosity of heavy crude oil dramatically. However, this direct&#8208;contact heating approach presents a potential risk due to the high voltage applied. To develop a non&#8208;contact recovery of viscous crude oil, here, a new approach for the fabrication of a series of ferrimagnetic sponges (FMSs) with hydrophobic porous channels is reported, whose surface can be remotely heated to 120 &#176;C within 10 s under an alternating magnetic field (f&#160;= 274&#160;kHz, H&#160;= 30 kA m&#8722;1). Compared with the solar&#8208;driven superficial heating, the integral magnetic heating in FMSs can result in a higher internal temperature of the sponges because of the confinement of thermal transport in the porous channels, which contributes to a dramatic decrease in oil viscosity and a significant increase in oil flow into the pores of FMSs. Furthermore, FMSs assembled with a self&#8208;priming pump can achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil (33.05&#160;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) via remotely magnetic heating.

Furthermore, FMSs assembled with a self-priming pump can achieve continuous recovery of viscous crude oil (33.05&#160;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) via remotely magnetic heating.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;Low&#8208;Temperature Elastomer with Excellent Mechanical Performance and Solvent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based elastomers crosslinked by dynamic urethane are reported, which exhibit excellent elasticity at temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Moreover, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segments also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in low&#8208;temperature sealing applications.








Abstract
Elastomers presenting good elasticity, ductility, and chemical resistance at low temperatures can serve as superior performers for explorations in extremely cold environments. However, no commercially available elastomer to date can comprehensively fulfill those demands. Here, a perfluoropolyether (PFPE)&#8208;based network crosslinked by dynamic urethane chemistry is demonstrated, which may satisfy the demands of application in ultracold environments. As the crucial constitute in such a crosslinked network, PFPE provides the elastomer with excellent elasticity at a temperature down to &#8722;110 &#176;C&#160;and outstanding ductility within the cryogenic temperature range. Importantly, the high proportion of fluorocarbon segment also provides wonderful compatibility to most organic solvents, accounting for the low&#8208;swelling characteristics of the elastomer in sealing applications. Furthermore, the dynamic crosslinking feature allows the cured elastomer to be reprocessed like thermoplastic polymers, which affords great promise to recycle and reuse the elastomer after its disposal. Inherently, this elastomer would inspire a worldwide interest in the design of elastic devices that are adaptable to extremely low temperature.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for Biocompatible X&#8208;Ray Detector to Attain Highest Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 single crystal is grown. The crystal exhibits triplet self&#8208;trapping excitons recombination, a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 53%, and structure&#8208;modulated band nature and luminescence under high pressure. Finally, high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray response and imaging are demonstrated with sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed metal&#8208;based halide perovskites have taken a dominant position for perovskite optoelectronics including light emission and X&#8208;ray detection; however, the toxicity of the included heavy metals severely restricts their applications for wearable, lightweight, and transient optoelectronic devices. Here, the authors describe investigations of large (4 &#215; 6 &#215; 2 mm3) 3D metal&#8208;free perovskite MDABCO&#8208;NH4I3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystal and its charge recombination and extraction behavior for light emission and X&#8208;ray detection. Unlike conventional 3D metal&#8208;based perovskites, this lightweight and biocompatible perovskite large crystal is processed from aqueous solution at room temperature, and can achieve both an extremely long carrier lifetime up to &#8776;1.03 &#181;s and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excited states for luminescence. These features contribute to a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as &#8776;53% at room temperature and an X&#8208;ray sensitivity up to 1997 &#177; 80 &#956;C Gy&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 50&#160;V bias (highest among all metal&#8208;free detectors). The ability to tune the perovskite band gap by modulating the structure under high pressure is also demonstrated, which opens up applications for the crystal as colored emitters. These attributes make it a molecular alternative to metal&#8208;based perovskites for biocompatible and transient optoelectronics.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Fast Na Storage Kinetics in Ether Electrolytes for Hard Carbon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A monodispersed nanospherules hard carbon anode is successfully synthesized, showing excellent electrochemical performance when matched with an ether&#8208;based electrolyte in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism and the formed thin solid electrolyte interphase film with low interface impedance in ether&#8208;based electrolytes can significantly accelerate Na storage kinetics for hard carbon anodes.








Abstract
The sodium storage performance of a hard carbon (HC) anode in ether electrolytes exhibits a higher initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) and better rate performance compared to conventional ester electrolytes. However, the mechanism behind faster Na storage kinetics for HC in ether electrolytes remains unclear. Herein, a unique solvated Na+ and Na+ co&#8208;intercalation mechanism in ether electrolytes is reported using designed monodispersed HC nanospheres. In addition, a thin solid electrolyte interphase film with a high inorganic proportion formed in an ether electrolyte is visualized by cryo transmission electron microscopy and depth&#8208;profiling X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which facilitates Na+ transportation, and results in a high ICE. Furthermore, the fast solvated Na+ diffusion kinetics in ether electrolytes are also revealed via molecular dynamics simulation. Owing to the contribution of the ether electrolytes, an excellent rate performance (214&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh plateau capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1) and a high ICE (84.93% at 1 A g&#8722;1) are observed in a half cell; in a full cell, an attractive specific capacity of 110.3 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1.

         <title>A Soft and Absorbable Temporary Epicardial Pacing Wire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (TPW), made of materials approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)] and liquid metal (EGaIn), can pace the heart to recover from abnormal heartbeats after surgery and reduce the severe complications from the rigid and nonabsorbable TPWs.








Abstract
Existing temporary epicardial pacing wires (TPWs) are rigid and non&#8208;absorbable, such that they can cause severe complications after cardiac surgery. Here, a soft and absorbable temporary epicardial pacing wire (saTPW) for effectively correcting abnormal heart rates in a rabbit model, such as bradycardia and ventricular premature beat, is developed. The saTPW exhibits excellent conductivity, flexibility, cycling stability (&gt;100&#160;000 cycles), and less inflammatory response during two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation in a rat model. The saTPW which consists of poly(l&#8208;lactide&#8208;co&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and liquid metal, can degrade about 13% (mass loss) in the rats over a two&#8208;month subcutaneous implantation. It can be absorbed over time in the body. The cytocompatibility and absorbability avoid secondary injuries caused by remaining wires which are permanently left in the body. The saTPW will provide a great platform for diagnosis and treatments in cardiovascular diseases by delivering the physiological signal and applying electrical stimulation for therapy.

         <title>Second Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Activatable Polymeric Nanoantagonist for Photothermal Immunometabolic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA) is presented, whose photothermal and immunomodulation activities are controlled by second near&#8208;infrared light. Such a design can not only elicit tumor ablation and immunogenic cell death, but also initiate immunometabolic reprogramming on the adenosinergic pathway, thereby fostering tumoricidal cytotoxic T cells yet counteracting the immunosuppressive Treg cells in tumor.








Abstract
Immunometabolic modulation offers new opportunities to treat cancers as it is highly associated with cancer progression and immunosuppressive microenvironment. However, traditional regimens using nonselective small&#8208;molecule immunomodulators lead to the off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic outcomes. Herein a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermally activatable semiconducting polymeric nanoantagonist (ASPA) for synergistic photothermal immunometabolic therapy of cancer is reported. ASPA backbone is obtained by conjugating vipadenant, an antagonist to adenosine A2A receptor, onto NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer via an azo&#8208;based thermolabile linker. Under deep&#8208;penetrating NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation, ASPA induces tumor thermal ablation and subsequently immunogenic cell death, triggers the cleavage of thermolabile linker, and releases the antagonist to block the immunosuppressive adenosinergic pathway. Such a remotely controlled immunometabolic regulation potentiates cytotoxic T cell functions while suppresses regulatory T cell activities, leading to efficient primary tumor inhibition, pulmonary metastasis prevention, and long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this work provides a generic polymeric approach for precise spatiotemporal regulation of cancer immunometabolism.

         <title>Dynamic Bifunctional Metasurfaces for Holography and Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic bifunctional metasurface for color nanoprinting and metaholograms is numerically and experimentally realized. Metaholograms are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of the metasurface. The light diffraction can be switched between the &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged for different wavelength with the infiltration of the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution, making the colorful holographic images dynamically switchable.








Abstract
Metasurfaces have shown their unprecedented ability in wavefront shaping and triggered various applications with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performances, e.g., color nanoprinting and metaholograms. Recently, these two functions have been combined into a single metasurface to further expand its capabilities. Despite the progress, the current dual&#8208;mode metasurfaces are mostly static and strongly hinder their practical applications. Herein, the realization of dynamic bifunctional metasurfaces is reported. Five metaholograms at two different wavelengths are multiplexed with structural colors by controlling the spectral and phase response of metasurface. Owing to the destructive interference and the resonance on external environment, the light diffraction at particular wavelengths can be switched between &#8220;ON&#8221; and &#8220;OFF&#8221; states, or remain unchanged with the change of surrounding refractive index. Consequently, the encoded metaholograms are selectively turned on and off, making the overall holographic image dynamically switchable. This concept paves a solid step toward practical applications of all&#8208;dielectric metasurfaces.

         <title>Precipitation Hardening in Ferroelectric Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ferroelectric hardening method is proposed by precipitating a secondary phase inside of the ferroelectric grains. Akin to hindered dislocation motion in metals, domain wall motion in ferroelectrics is impeded and loss is reduced. The mechanical quality factor in the model system BaTiO3&#8211;CaTiO3 is enhanced by 1.5 times, while the piezoelectric coefficient and planar electromechanical coupling factor remain nearly unchanged.








Abstract
Domain wall motion in ferroics, similar to dislocation motion in metals, can be tuned by well&#8208;concepted microstructural elements. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, the domain wall motion is considered as a lossy hysteretic mechanism that should be restricted. Current applications for so&#8208;called hard piezoelectrics are abundant and hinge on the use of an acceptor&#8208;doping scheme. However, this mechanism features severe limitations due to enhanced mobility of oxygen vacancies at moderate temperatures. By analogy with metal technology, the authors present here a new solution for electroceramics, where precipitates are utilized to pin domain walls and improve piezoelectric properties. Through a sequence of sintering, nucleation, and precipitate growth, intragranular precipitates leading to a fine domain structure are developed as shown by transmission electron microscopy, piezoresponse force microscopy, and phase&#8208;field simulation. This structure impedes the domain wall motion as elucidated by electromechanical characterization. As a result, the mechanical quality factor is increased by &#8776;50% and the hysteresis in electrostrain is suppressed considerably. This is even achieved with slightly increased piezoelectric coefficient and electromechanical coupling factor. This novel process can be smoothly implemented in industrial production processes and is accessible to simple laboratory experimentation for microstructure optimization and implementation in various ferroelectric systems.

         <title>Molecular Alignment of Homoleptic Iridium Phosphors in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Dopant alignment in doped, vacuum&#8208;deposited films can be promoted by molecular asymmetry and/or asymmetry in the dopant's electrostatic surface potential.








Abstract
The orientation of facial (fac) tris&#8208;cyclometalated iridium complexes in doped films prepared by vacuum deposition is investigated by altering the physical shape and electronic asymmetry in the molecular structure. Angle&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy and Fourier&#8208;plane imaging microscopy show that the orientation of roughly spherical fac&#8208;tris(2&#8208;phenylpyridyl)iridium (Ir(ppy)3) is isotropic, whereas complexes that are oblate spheroids, fac&#8208;tris(mesityl&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mi)3) and fac&#8208;tris((3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;[1,1&#8242;&#8208;biphenyl]&#8208;4&#8208;yl)&#8208;2&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazole)iridium (Ir(mip)3), have a net horizontal alignment of their transition dipole moments. Optical anisotropy factors of 0.26 and 0.15, respectively, are obtained from the latter complexes when doped into tris(4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)amine host thin films. The horizontal alignment is attributed to the favorable van der Waals interaction between the oblate Ir complexes and host material. Trifluoromethyl groups substituted on one polar face of the Ir(ppy)3 and Ir(mi)3 complexes introduce chemical asymmetries in the molecules at the expense of their oblate shapes. The anisotropy factors of films doped with these substituted derivatives are lower relative to the parent complexes, indicating that the fluorinated patches reinforce horizontal alignment during deposition. High efficiencies obtained from organic light emitting diodes prepared using the Ir dopants is attributed, in part, to improved outcoupling of electroluminescence brought about by molecular alignment.

         <title>Hydrogel Ionic Diodes toward Harvesting Ultralow&#8208;Frequency Mechanical Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel ionic diode for ultralow&#8208;frequency mechanical&#8208;energy harvesting is designed based on a sandwiched structure of anion and cation ionomers in hydrogels embedded with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowire electrodes. The ionic diode exhibits power density, charge density, and harvested energy that outperform current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude at 0.01&#160;Hz.








Abstract
Energy harvesting from human motion is regarded as a promising protocol for powering portable electronics, biomedical devices, and smart objects of the Internet of things. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art mechanical&#8208;energy&#8208;harvesting devices generally operate at frequencies (&gt;10&#160;Hz) well beyond human activity frequencies. Here, a hydrogel ionic diode formed by the layered structures of anionic and cationic ionomers in hydrogels is presented. As confirmed by finite element analysis, the underlying mechanism of the hydrogel ionic diode involves the formation of the depletion region by mobile cations and anions and the subsequent increase of the built&#8208;in potential across the depletion region in response to mechanical pressure. Owing to the enhanced ionic rectification ratio by the embedded carbon nanotube and silver nanowire electrodes, the hydrogel ionic diode exhibits a power density of &#8776;5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a charge density of &#8776;4&#160;mC&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0.01&#160;Hz, outperforming the current energy&#8208;harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude. The applications of the self&#8208;powered hydrogel ionic diode to tactile sensing, pressure imaging, and touchpads are demonstrated, with sensing limitation is as low as 0.01&#160;kPa. This work is expected to open up new opportunities for ionic&#8208;current&#8208;based ionotronics in electronics and energy devices.

&lt;p&gt;A hydrogel ionic diode for ultralow-frequency mechanical-energy harvesting is designed based on a sandwiched structure of anion and cation ionomers in hydrogels embedded with carbon nanotubes and silver nanowire electrodes. The ionic diode exhibits power density, charge density, and harvested energy that outperform current energy-harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude at 0.01&#160;Hz.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy harvesting from human motion is regarded as a promising protocol for powering portable electronics, biomedical devices, and smart objects of the Internet of things. However, state-of-the-art mechanical-energy-harvesting devices generally operate at frequencies (&lt;b&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;10&#160;Hz) well beyond human activity frequencies. Here, a hydrogel ionic diode formed by the layered structures of anionic and cationic ionomers in hydrogels is presented. As confirmed by finite element analysis, the underlying mechanism of the hydrogel ionic diode involves the formation of the depletion region by mobile cations and anions and the subsequent increase of the built-in potential across the depletion region in response to mechanical pressure. Owing to the enhanced ionic rectification ratio by the embedded carbon nanotube and silver nanowire electrodes, the hydrogel ionic diode exhibits a power density of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;5&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a charge density of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;4&#160;mC&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.01&#160;Hz, outperforming the current energy-harvesting devices by several orders of magnitude. The applications of the self-powered hydrogel ionic diode to tactile sensing, pressure imaging, and touchpads are demonstrated, with sensing limitation is as low as 0.01&#160;kPa.

         <title>Spin&#8211;Orbit Torque&#8208;Induced Domain Nucleation for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dominant mode of field&#8208;free magnetization switching in L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer is demonstrated to be domain nucleation. The stable intermediate states from domain nucleation grant excellent memristive plasticity, which allows the spintronic device to be used as an artificial sigmoidal neuron. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept live training is performed to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate comparable to simulation.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing has become an increasingly popular approach for artificial intelligence because it can perform cognitive tasks more efficiently than conventional computers. However, it remains challenging to develop dedicated hardware for artificial neural networks. Here, a simple bilayer spintronic device for hardware implementation of neuromorphic computing is demonstrated. In L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer, current&#8208;inducted field&#8208;free magnetization switching by symmetry&#8208;dependent spin&#8211;orbit torques shows a unique domain nucleation&#8208;dominated magnetization reversal, which is not accessible in conventional bilayers. Gradual domain nucleation creates multiple intermediate magnetization states which form the basis of a sigmoidal neuron. Using the L11&#8208;CuPt/CoPt bilayer as a sigmoidal neuron, the training of a deep learning network to recognize written digits, with a high recognition rate (87.5%) comparable to simulation (87.8%) is further demonstrated. This work offers a new scheme of implementing artificial neural networks by magnetic domain nucleation.

         <title>Interfacial Embedding of Laser&#8208;Manufactured Fluorinated Gold Clusters Enabling Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Over 24%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrophobic p&#8208;type semiconducting additive, fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters, is used as a bifunctional interfacial mediator to efficiently modulate the carrier dynamics of perovskite and restrain the perovskite from degradation by external environmental stimuli, which results in an n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite solar cell with a champion efficiency up to 24.02% and moisture stability over 10 000 h in relative humidity of 75%.








Abstract
Tackling the interfacial loss in emerged perovskite&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs) to address synchronously the carrier dynamics and the environmental stability, has been of fundamental and viable importance, while technological hurdles remain in not only creating such interfacial mediator, but the subsequent interfacial embedding in the active layer. This article reports a strategy of interfacial embedding of hydrophobic fluorinated&#8208;gold&#8208;clusters (FGCs) for highly efficient and stable PSCs. The p&#8208;type semiconducting feature enables the FGC efficient interfacial mediator to improve the carrier dynamics by reducing the interfacial carrier transfer barrier and boosting the charge extraction at grain boundaries. The hydrophobic tails of the gold clusters and the hydrogen bonding between fluorine groups and perovskite favor the enhancement of environmental stability. Benefiting from these merits, highly efficient formamidinium lead iodide PSCs (champion efficiency up to 24.02%) with enhanced phase stability under varied relative humidity (RH) from 40% to 95%, as well as highly efficient mixed&#8208;cation PSCs with moisture stability (RH of 75%) over 10 000 h are achieved. It is thus inspiring to advance the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via interfacial embedding laser&#8208;generated additives for improved charge transfer/extraction and environmental stability.

         <title>Directional Magnetization Reversal Enables Ultrahigh Energy Density in Gradient Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A directional magnetization reversal is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures, in contrast to the conventional random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics. This directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high saturation magnetization and high coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy product of 26 MG Oe for isotropic permanent magnetic materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ferromagnetic materials are essential for energy conversion and electronic devices. However, the random and nonuniform magnetization reversal in ferromagnetics limits their performance that can be achieved. Here, through both micromagnetism simulations and experiments, a directional magnetization reversal that initiates first from large grains toward smaller ones is discovered by engineering Nd2Fe14B/&#945;&#8208;Fe gradient nanostructures. Such directional magnetization reversal enables a rare combination of high magnetization and large coercivity, thus leading to a record&#8208;high energy density (26 MG Oe) for isotropic permanent magnetic materials, which is &#8776;50% higher than that of its gradient&#8208;free counterpart. The unusual magnetization reversal originates from an ordered arrangement of grain sizes in the gradient material, where the large grains have a lower reversal field than that of the smaller ones. These findings open up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance magnetic materials.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Chiral Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Based on Strained Monolayer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using strained monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the threefold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K&#8217; valleys, to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature chiral light sources whose optical helicity can be electrically switched are one of the most important devices for future optical quantum information processing. The emerging valley degree of freedom in monolayer semiconductors allows generation of chiral luminescence via valley polarization. However, relevant valley&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) have only been achieved at low temperatures (typically below 80 K). Here, a room&#8208;temperature chiral LED with strained transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers is realized. Spatially resolved polarization spectroscopy reveals that strain effects are crucial to yielding robust valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence. The broken threefold rotational symmetry of strained monolayers induce inequivalent valley drifts at the K/K&#8217; valleys, resulting in different amounts of spin recombination driven by electric fields. Based on this scenario, ideally strained conditions are designed for LEDs on flexible substrates, in which the helicity of room&#8208;temperature valley&#8208;polarized electroluminescence is electrically tuned. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

         <title>Heterogeneous 2D/3D Tin&#8208;Halides Perovskite Solar Cells with Certified Conversion Efficiency Breaking 14%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and effective strategy is delivered to modulate the 2D/3D microstructure of tin&#8208;perovskite films by introduction of a 2D phase with the function of FPEABr, which induces high&#8208;orientation growth of 3D&#160;FASnI3 by embracing the 3D grains at their surfaces and boundaries. That leads to a breakthrough of device performance of 14.81% in power conversion efficiency, along with 14.03% certified.








Abstract
As the most promising lead&#8208;free one, tin&#8208;halides based perovskite solar cells still suffer from the severe bulk&#8208;defect due to the easy oxidation of tin from divalent to tetravalent. Here, a general and effective strategy is delivered to modulate the microstructure of 2D/3D heterogeneous tin&#8208;perovskite absorber films by substituting FAI with FPEABr in FASnI3. The introduction of 2D&#160;phase can induce highly oriented growth of 3D FASnI3 and it is revealed in the optimal 2D/3D film that 2D phase embraces 3D grains and locates at the surfaces and grain boundaries. The FPEA+ based 2D tin&#8208;perovskite capping layer can offer a reducing atmosphere for vulnerable 3D FASnI3 grains. The unique microstructure effectively suppresses the well&#8208;known oxidation from Sn2+ to Sn4+, as well as decreasing defect density, which leads to a remarkable enhanced device performance from 9.38% to 14.81% in conversion efficiency. The certified conversion efficiency of 14.03% announces a new record and moves a remarkable step from the last one (12.4%). Besides of this breakthrough, this work definitely paves a new way to fabricate high&#8208;quality tin&#8208;perovskite absorber film by constructing effective 2D/3D microstructures.

Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes
A room&#8208;temperature electrically tunable chiral light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100601, using strained monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides. The strain effects break the three&#8208;fold rotational symmetry, which results in different amounts of spin recombination at the K/K' valleys to generate chiral light emission driven by electric fields. The results provide a new pathway for practical chiral light sources based on monolayer semiconductors.

Coatings
In article number 2102349, Yixin Zhang and co&#8208;workers report an amphiphilic coating for glass surfaces, on which small droplets of polar aprotic organic solvents can be deposited with an enhanced contact angle (small feature size) and inhibited motion (strong binding), permitting fully automated multiple rounds of combinatorial synthesis of small&#8208;molecule compounds and peptides. The amphiphilic coating can be switched to hydrophilic network for protein&#8208; and cell&#8208;based screening.

Environmental Remediation
In article number 2100074, Yang Lu, Shu&#8208;Hong Yu, and co&#8208;workers report ferrimagnetic sponges for continuous recovery of viscous crude oil under the exposure of alternating magnetic field. The viscosity of crude oil around the magneto&#8208;heated sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating the absorption into the sponge and achieving continuous recovery.

The viscosity of crude oil around the magneto-heated sponge decreases sharply, thus accelerating the absorption into the sponge and achieving continuous recovery.

Quasicrystals
In article number 2102507, Kaoru Kimura, Ryo Yoshida, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that machine&#8208;learning algorithms can predict the chemical composition of new quasicrystals. Furthermore, analyzing the input&#8211;output relationships black&#8208;boxed into the machine&#8208;learning model, they successfully identify nontrivial empirical equations interpretable by humans that describe the conditions necessary for stable quasicrystal formation. This is the first step toward understanding the formation mechanism of quasicrystals, which has been long sought in quasicrystal research.

Biomedical Applications
In article number 2102624, Songwan Jin and co&#8208;workers generate liver spheroids that resemble the in vivo structure of the lobules. The structural integrity is maintained for several days, engendering an increased performance of cellular function. This is achieved thanks to the combination of two cutting edge technologies: preset&#8208;extrusion 3D bioprinting and microfluidics. Moreover, structured microtissues once injected into animals show a better engraftment, bringing to light the importance of phenotypically relevant models not only for drug screening but also regenerative medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Structural Design and Electrochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention due to their obvious advantage regarding the potassium reserves. Cathode materials, which determine the energy density of PIBs, usually suffer from serious structural deformation during continuous K+ (de)intercalation. Therefore, proper structural&#8208;design principles of cathode materials should be focused on to ensure high performance to promote the further development of PIBs.








Abstract
Due to the obvious advantage in potassium reserves, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention as an alternative energy storage system for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the large size of K+ makes it a challenging task to identify suitable electrode materials, particularly cathode ones that determine the energy density of PIBs, capable of tolerating the serious structural deformation during the continuous intercalation/deintercalation of K+. It is therefore of paramount importance that proper design principles of cathode materials be followed to ensure stable electrochemical performance if a practical application of PIBs is expected. Herein, the current knowledge on the structural engineering of cathode materials acquired during the battle against its performance degradation is summarized. The K+ storage behavior of different types of cathodes is discussed in detail and the structure&#8211;performance relationship of materials sensitive to their different lattice frameworks is highlighted. The key issues facing the future development of different categories of cathode materials are also highlighted and perspectives for potential approaches and strategies to promote the further development of PIBs are provided.

         <dc:description>
As an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts, dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs) with high metal loading, sophisticated and flexible active sites have aroused great interest. The recent development of DASCs in characterization, synthetic methods, and catalytic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures have been the research hotspot in heterogeneous catalysis because of their high atomic utilization efficiency, outstanding activity, and selectivity. Dual&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (DASCs), as an extension of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), have recently drawn surging attention. The DASCs possess higher metal loading, more sophisticated and flexible active sites, offering more chance for achieving better catalytic performance, compared with SACs. In this review, recent advances on how to design new DASCs for enhancing energy catalysis will be highlighted. It will start with the classification of marriage of two kinds of single&#8208;atom active sites, homonuclear DASCs and heteronuclear DASCs according to the configuration of active sites. Then, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques for DASCs will be discussed. Different synthetic methods and catalytic applications of the DASCs in various reactions, including oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, carbon monoxide oxidation reaction, and others will be followed. Finally, the major challenges and perspectives of DASCs will be provided.

         <title>Pushing the Limits of Flexibility and Stretchability of Solar Cells: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable solar cells are important for a range of emerging applications such as electronic skins, e&#8208;textiles, wearable displays and health sensors, among others. An overview of stretchable optoelectronics is provided, where the benefits of stretchable solar cells are addressed, and the progress made in this field in terms of efficiency and strategies to achieve mechanical stretchability are underlined.








Abstract
Emerging forms of soft, flexible, and stretchable electronics promise to revolutionize the electronics industries of the future offering radically new products that combine multiple functionalities, including power generation, with arbitrary form factor. For example, skin&#8208;like electronics promise to transform the human&#8208;machine&#8208;interface, but the softness of the skin is incompatible with traditional electronic components. To address this issue, new strategies toward soft and wearable electronic systems are currently being pursued, which also include stretchable photovoltaics as self&#8208;powering systems for use in autonomous and stretchable electronics of the future. Here recent developments in the field of stretchable photovoltaics are reviewed and their potential for various emerging applications are examined. Emphasis is placed on the different strategies to induce stretchability including extrinsic and intrinsic approaches. In the former case, engineering and patterning of the materials and devices are key elements while intrinsically stretchable systems rely on mechanically compliant materials such as elastomers and organic conjugated polymers. The result is a review article that provides a comprehensive summary of the progress to date in the field of stretchable solar cells from the nanoscale to macroscopic functional devices. The article is concluded by discussing the emerging trends and future developments.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Analysis of Conductive and Strong Carbon Nanotube Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 36, September 7, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A meta&#8208;analysis of 1304 data points collated over 266 papers statistically evaluates the relationships between carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, at an extrinsic and intrinsic level, and compares them to graphitic intercalation compounds and conductive polymers. An unrivaled deep dive into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, it provides a roadmap to developing advanced CNT conductors simultaneously competitive with copper and carbon fiber.








Abstract
A study of 1304 data points collated over 266 papers statistically evaluates the relationships between carbon nanotube (CNT) material characteristics, including: electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties; ampacity; density; purity; microstructure alignment; molecular dimensions and graphitic perfection; and doping. Compared to conductive polymers and graphitic intercalation compounds, which have exceeded the electrical conductivity of copper, CNT materials are currently one&#8208;sixth of copper's conductivity, mechanically on&#8208;par with synthetic or carbon fibers, and exceed all the other materials in terms of a multifunctional metric. Doped, aligned few&#8208;wall CNTs (FWCNTs) are the most superior CNT category; from this, the acid&#8208;spun fiber subset are the most conductive, and the subset of fibers directly spun from floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition are strongest on a weight basis. The thermal conductivity of multiwall CNT material rivals that of FWCNT materials. Ampacity follows a diameter&#8208;dependent power&#8208;law from nanometer to millimeter scales. Undoped, aligned FWCNT material reaches the intrinsic conductivity of CNT bundles and single&#8208;crystal graphite, illustrating an intrinsic limit requiring doping for copper&#8208;level conductivities. Comparing an assembly of CNTs (forming mesoscopic bundles, then macroscopic material) to an assembly of graphene (forming single&#8208;crystal graphite crystallites, then carbon fiber), the &#8776;1 &#181;m room&#8208;temperature, phonon&#8208;limited mean&#8208;free&#8208;path shared between graphene, metallic CNTs, and activated semiconducting CNTs is highlighted, deemphasizing all metallic helicities for CNT power transmission applications.

         <title>Sensing Molecules with Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Functionalized Graphene Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of sensing molecules is introduced, which combines the sensitivity of a graphene field&#8208;effect transistor with the selectivity of a metal&#8211;organic framework. As a prototype example, an ethanol sensor is fabricated that is insensitive to other alcohols and humidity. The readout signal is a shift in the Dirac voltage.








Abstract
Graphene is inherently sensitive to vicinal dielectrics and local charge distributions, a property that can be probed by the position of the Dirac point in graphene field&#8208;effect transistors. Exploiting this as a useful sensing principle requires selectivity; however, graphene itself exhibits no molecule&#8208;specific interaction. Complementarily, metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be tailored to selective adsorption of specific molecular species. Here, a selective ethanol sensor is demonstrated by growing a surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic framework (SURMOF) directly onto graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs). Unprecedented shifts of the Dirac point, as large as 15&#160;V, are observed when the SURMOF/GFET is exposed to ethanol, while a vanishingly small response is observed for isopropanol, methanol, and other constituents of the air, including water. The synthesis and conditioning of the hybrid materials sensor with its functional characteristics are described and a model is proposed to explain the origin, magnitude, and direction of the Dirac point voltage shift. Tailoring multiple SURMOFs to adsorb specific gases on an array of such devices thus generates a versatile, selective, and highly sensitive platform for sensing applications.

         <title>Thermoelectric Cu12Sb4Sb13&#8208;Based Synthetic Minerals with a Sublimation&#8208;Derived Porous Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous network structure with excellent electrical properties can enhance the thermoelectric performance of solid materials. This work demonstrates that a porous structure can be introduced into tetrahedrite&#8208;based synthetic minerals by a unique BiI3 sublimation technique. The multiscale architectures simultaneously disrupt phonon transport and trigger energy&#8208;dependent scattering of holes, leading to a superior zT value of 1.15 at 723 K.








Abstract
Pores in a solid can effectively reduce thermal conduction, but they are not favored in thermoelectric materials due to simultaneous deterioration of electrical conductivity. Conceivably, creating a porous structure may endow thermoelectric performance enhancement provided that overwhelming reduction of electrical conductivity can be suppressed. This work demonstrates such an example, in which a porous structure is formed leading to a significant enhancement in the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT). By a unique BiI3 sublimation technique, pore networks can be introduced into tetrahedrite Cu12Sb4S13&#8208;based materials, accompanied by changes in their hierarchical structures. The addition of a small quantity of BiI3 (0.7 vol%) results in a &#8776;72% reduction in the lattice thermal conductivity, whereas the electrical conductivity is improved due to unexpected enhanced carrier mobility. As a result, an enhanced zT of 1.15 at 723 K in porous tetrahedrite and a high conversion efficiency of 6% at &#916;T&#160;= 419 K in a fabricated segmented single&#8208;leg based on this porous material are achieved. This work offers an effective way to concurrently modulate the electrical and thermal properties during the synthesis of high&#8208;performance porous thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Superior Sodium Storage Properties in the Anode Material NiCr2S4 for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: An X&#8208;ray Diffraction, Pair Distribution Function, and X&#8208;ray Absorption Study Reveals a Conversion Mechanism via Nickel Extrusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Results of an extensive study of pseudo&#8208;layered NiCr2S4 as an anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries are reported. Electrochemical and kinetic characteristics, X&#8208;ray absorption, diffraction, and total&#8208;scattering experiments evidence a complex and unusual charge storage mechanism: nickel extrusion and sodium insertion via formation of a NaCrS2 intermediate followed by the full conversion to nanocrystalline Ni0, Cr0, and Na2S is observed.








Abstract
The pseudo&#8208;layered sulfide NiCr2S4 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 is observed at 2.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 in the potential window 3.0&#8211;0.1&#160;V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni0 and Cr0 nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na2S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface&#8208;controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni0 and Cr0 are oxidized, Na2S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0&#8211;0.3&#160;V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni2+ is reduced to nanosized Ni0 domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na+ cations to form O3&#8208;type like NaCrS2. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na+ shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr2S4 and NaCrS2 enabling a superior long&#8208;term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.

Electrochemical and kinetic characteristics, X-ray absorption, diffraction, and total-scattering experiments evidence a complex and unusual charge storage mechanism: nickel extrusion and sodium insertion via formation of a NaCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate followed by the full conversion to nanocrystalline Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Cr&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, and Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is observed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pseudo-layered sulfide NiCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding electrochemical performance as anode material in sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The Na storage mechanism is investigated by synchrotron-based X-ray scattering and absorption techniques as well as by electrochemical measurements. A very high reversible capacity in the 500th cycle of 489&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is observed at 2.0&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the potential window 3.0&#8211;0.1&#160;V. Full discharge includes irreversible generation of Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Cr&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; nanoparticles embedded in nanocrystalline Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S yielding shortened diffusion lengths and predominantly surface-controlled charge storage. During charge, Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; and Cr&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; are oxidized, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is consumed, and amorphous Ni and Cr sulfides are formed. Limiting the potential window to 3.0&#8211;0.3&#160;V an unusual nickel extrusion sodium insertion mechanism occurs: Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to nanosized Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; domains, expelled from the host lattice, and is replaced by Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cations to form O3-type like NaCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Surprisingly, the discharge and charge processes comprise Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shuttling between highly crystalline NiCr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCrS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enabling a superior long-term stability for 3000 cycles. The results not only provide valuable insights for the electrochemistry of conversion materials but also extend the scope of layered electrode materials considering the reversible nickel extrusion sodium insertion reaction as new concept for SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Functional Metasurfaces for Mid&#8208;Infrared Photonics and Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To further move &#8220;meta&#8208;photonics&#8221; toward real&#8208;world applications, a complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible nanofabrication method is developed for free&#8208;standing dielectric and plasmonic metasurfaces. The advantages of this method are revealed by demonstrating uniform and functional metasurfaces, including large&#8208;area metalenses for diffraction&#8208;limited focusing, spectrally selective high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor nanostructures, polarization&#8208;control birefringent metasurfaces, and aluminum plasmonic optofluidic biosensors.








Abstract
Metasurfaces have emerged as a breakthrough platform for manipulating light at the nanoscale and enabling on&#8208;demand optical functionalities for next&#8208;generation biosensing, imaging, and light&#8208;generating photonic devices. However, translating this technology to practical applications requires low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;throughput fabrication methods. Due to the limited choice of materials with suitable optical properties, it is particularly challenging to produce metasurfaces for the technologically relevant mid&#8208;infrared spectral range. These constraints are overcome by realizing functional metasurfaces on almost completely transparent free&#8208;standing metal&#8208;oxide membranes. A versatile nanofabrication process is developed and implemented for highly efficient dielectric and plasmonic mid&#8208;infrared metasurfaces with wafer&#8208;scale and complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible manufacturing techniques. The advantages of this method are revealed by demonstrating highly uniform and functional metasurfaces, including high&#8208;Q structures enabling fine spectral selectivity, large&#8208;area metalenses&#160;with&#160;diffraction&#8208;limited focusing capabilities, and birefringent metasurfaces providing polarization control at record&#8208;high conversion efficiencies.&#160; Aluminum plasmonic devices and their integration into microfluidics for real&#8208;time and label&#8208;free mid&#8208;infrared biosensing of proteins and lipid vesicles are further demonstrated. The versatility of this approach and its compatibility with mass&#8208;production processes bring infrared metasurfaces markedly closer to commercial applications, such as thermal imaging, spectroscopy, and biosensing.

Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are vital energy&#8208;storage devices in modern society. However, the performance and cost are still not satisfactory in terms of energy density, power density, cycle life, safety, etc. To further improve the performance of batteries, traditional &#8220;trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8221; processes require a vast number of tedious experiments. Computational chemistry and artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly accelerate the research and development of novel battery systems. Herein, a heterogeneous category of AI technology for predicting and discovering battery materials and estimating the state of the battery system is reviewed. Successful examples, the challenges of deploying AI in real&#8208;world scenarios, and an integrated framework are analyzed and outlined. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research about the applications of ML in the property prediction and battery discovery, including electrolyte and electrode materials, are further summarized. Meanwhile, the prediction of battery states is also provided. Finally, various existing challenges and the framework to tackle the challenges on the further development of machine learning for rechargeable LIBs are proposed.

         <title>Localized Graphitization on Diamond Surface as a Manifestation of Dopants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale imaging and spectroscopy of boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) film electrodes reveal localized dopant&#8208;induced surface graphitization. This work presents the first experimental demonstration of dopant effects on the surface morphology of doped diamond and explains the role of boron in the formation of density of states in BDD and the strong crystallographic orientation dependence of its electrochemical activity.








Abstract
Doped diamond electrodes have attracted significant attention for decades owing to their excellent physical and electrochemical properties. However, direct experimental observation of dopant effects on the diamond surface has not been available until now. Here, low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy is utilized to investigate the atomic&#8208;scale morphology and electronic structures of (100)&#8208; and (111)&#8208;oriented boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) electrodes. Graphitized domains of a few nanometers are shown to manifest the effects of boron dopants on the BDD surface. Confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, local density of states measurements reveal that the electronic structure of these features is characterized by in&#8208;gap states induced by boron&#8208;related lattice deformation. The dopant&#8208;related graphitization is uniquely observed in BDD (111), which explains its electrochemical superiority over the (100) facet. These experimental observations provide atomic&#8208;scale information about the role of dopants in modulating the conductivity of diamond, as well as, possibly, other functional doped materials.

         <title>Manufacturing of Human Tissues as off&#8208;the&#8208;Shelf Grafts Programmed to Induce Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Custom design of off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf tissue grafts by genetically programmed human cell lines is exemplified in the bone regeneration context. Human cartilage tissue is engineered and devitalized within a 3D culture bioreactor system, enabling scalable graft manufacturing. Following lyophilization, the designed acellular template retains regenerative cues, instructing bone repair at unprecedented efficiency, compared to growth factor delivery or living engineered grafts.








Abstract
Design criteria for tissue&#8208;engineered materials in regenerative medicine include robust biological effectiveness, off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability, and scalable manufacturing under standardized conditions. For bone repair, existing strategies rely on primary autologous cells, associated with unpredictable performance, limited availability and complex logistic. Here, a conceptual shift based on the manufacturing of devitalized human hypertrophic cartilage (HyC), as cell&#8208;free material inducing bone formation by recapitulating the developmental process of endochondral ossification, is reported. The strategy relies on a customized human mesenchymal line expressing bone morphogenetic protein&#8208;2 (BMP&#8208;2), critically required for robust chondrogenesis and concomitant extracellular matrix (ECM) enrichment. Following apoptosis&#8208;driven devitalization, lyophilization, and storage, the resulting off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf cartilage tissue exhibits unprecedented osteoinductive properties, unmatched by synthetic delivery of BMP&#8208;2 or by living engineered grafts. Scalability and pre&#8208;clinical efficacy are demonstrated by bioreactor&#8208;based production and subsequent orthotopic assessment. The findings exemplify the broader paradigm of programming human cell lines as biological factory units to engineer customized ECMs, designed to activate specific regenerative processes.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Photonic Balls: Single Object Analysis for Local Thermal Probing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) photonic balls are fabricated by self&#8208;assembly of MOFs colloids into microdroplets via spray&#8208;drying, a low&#8208;cost, green, and high&#8208;throughput method. The versatility of the process allows tuning the morphology and the composition of materials with tailored photonic properties. MOF photonic balls can act as local, label&#8208;free (photo) thermal probes that enable determination of submillimetric temperature gradients.








Abstract
Due to their high porosity and chemical versatility, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) exhibit physical properties appealing for photonic&#8208;based applications. While several MOF photonic structures have been reported, examples of applications thereof are mainly limited to chemical sensing. Herein, the range of application of photonic MOFs is extended to local thermal and photothermal sensing by integrating them into a new architecture: MOF photonic balls. Micrometric&#8208;sized photonic balls are made of monodispersed MOFs colloids that are self&#8208;assembled via spray&#8208;drying, a low&#8208;cost, green, and high&#8208;throughput method. The versatility of the process allows tuning the morphology and the composition of photonic balls made of several MOFs and composites with tailored optical properties. X&#8208;ray nanotomography and environmental hyperspectral microscopy enable analysis of single objects and their evolution in controlled atmosphere and temperature. Notably, in presence of vapors, the MOF photonic balls act as local, label&#8208;free temperature probes. Importantly, compared to other thermal probes, the temperature detection range of these materials can be adjusted &#8220;on&#8208;demand.&#8221; As proof of concept, the photonic balls are used to determine local temperature profiles around a concentrated laser beam. More broadly, this work is expected to stimulate new research on the physical properties of photonic MOFs providing new possibilities for device fabrication.

         <title>Congener&#8208;Induced Sulfur&#8208;Related Metabolism Interference Therapy Promoted by Photothermal Sensitization for Combating Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanomaterial anti&#8208;implant&#8208;associated infection therapy named congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy is proposed, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners. The original nanodrug MnSe2 is devised to generate permeable H2Se into bacteria and eliminated them by specific destruction of metabolic homeostasis with the promotion of photothermal sensitization.








Abstract
Metabolic homeostasis is vital for individual cells to keep alive. Stronger metabolic homeostasis allows bacteria to survive in vivo and do persistent harm to hosts, which is especially typical in implant&#8208;associated infection (IAI) with biofilm intervention. Herein, based on the competitive role of selenium (Se) and sulfur (S) in bacteria metabolism as congeners, a congener&#8208;induced sulfur&#8208;related metabolism interference therapy (SMIT) eradicating IAI is proposed by specific destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The original nanodrug manganese diselenide (MnSe2) is devised to generate permeable H2Se in bacteria, triggered by the acidic microenvironment. H2Se, the congener substitution of H2S, as a bacteria&#8208;specific intermediate metabolite, can embed itself into the H2S&#8208;utilization pathway and further alternatively disrupt the downstream sulfur&#8208;related metabolism state inside bacteria. A proteomic study indicates ribosome&#8208;related proteins are heavily downregulated and the basic metabolic pathways are mainly disordered after SMIT, revealing the destruction of bacteria metabolic homeostasis. The efficiency of SMIT is significantly promoted with the mild temperature sensitization provided by the photothermal treatment (PTT) of MnSe2 nanoparticles, verified by the proteomic study and the anti&#8208;IAI effect in vitro and in vivo. With the intelligent nanodrug, a PTT&#8208;promoted SMIT strategy against IAI is provided and a new insight into the interference design toward metabolic homeostasis with biochemical similarity is demonstrated.

         <title>Stretchable Thin Film Mechanical&#8208;Strain&#8208;Gated Switches and Logic Gate Functions Based on a Soft Tunneling Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches play a key role in sensing, soft robotics, and stretchable electronics, which typically operate an &#8220;off&#8208;switch&#8221; function&#8212;exhibiting a decrease in conductivity upon an applied strain. A thin&#8208;film architecture that features the inverse behavior, &#8220;on&#8208;switch&#8221;: a strain&#8208;induced transition from insulating to metallic conductivity, spanning nine orders of magnitude in conductivity, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated switches are cornerstone components of material&#8208;embedded circuits that perform logic operations without using conventional electronics. This technology requires a single material system to exhibit three distinct functionalities: strain&#8208;invariant conductivity and an increase or decrease of conductivity upon mechanical deformation. Herein, mechanical&#8208;strain&#8208;gated electric switches based on a thin&#8208;film architecture that features an insulator&#8208;to&#8208;conductor transition when mechanically stretched are demonstrated. The conductivity changes by nine orders of magnitude over a wide range of tunable working strains (as high as 130%). The approach relies on a nanometer&#8208;scale sandwiched bilayer Au thin film with an ultrathin poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomeric barrier layer; applied strain alters the electron tunneling currents through the barrier. Mechanical&#8208;force&#8208;controlled electric logic circuits are achieved by realizing strain&#8208;controlled basic (AND and OR) and universal (NAND and NOR) logic gates in a single system. The proposed material system can be used to fabricate material&#8208;embedded logics of arbitrary complexity for a wide range of applications including soft robotics, wearable/implantable electronics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, and Internet of Things.

         <title>Wearable Thermoelectric Materials and Devices for Self&#8208;Powered Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable thermoelectric generators (WTEGs) have emerged as promising candidates for the effective conversion of body heat into electricity to power wearable devices. This review covers recent advancements in the development of WTEGs, from the material design to final device application. The problems in the WTEG devices and the future research directions in this field are also discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things has led to a growing demand for wearable and maintenance&#8208;free power sources. The continual push toward lower operating voltages and power consumption in modern integrated circuits has made the development of devices powered by body heat finally feasible. In this context, thermoelectric (TE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for the effective conversion of body heat into electricity to power wearable devices without being limited by environmental conditions. Driven by rapid advances in processing technology and the performance of TE materials over the past two decades, wearable thermoelectric generators (WTEGs) have gradually become more flexible and stretchable so that they can be used on complex and dynamic surfaces. In this review, the functional materials, processing techniques, and strategies for the device design of different types of WTEGs are comprehensively covered. Wearable self&#8208;powered systems based on WTEGs are summarized, including multi&#8208;function TE modules, hybrid energy harvesting, and all&#8208;in&#8208;one energy devices. Challenges in organic TE materials, interfacial engineering, and assessments of device performance are discussed, and suggestions for future developments in the area are provided. This review will promote the rapid implementation of wearable TE materials and devices in self&#8208;powered electronic systems.

         <title>Controlled Growth and Self&#8208;Assembly of Multiscale Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices. The intrinsic properties of OSs can be regulated through chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control.








Abstract
Currently, organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices related to energy storage and conversion, optoelectronics, catalysis, and biological sensors, etc. To satisfy the actual requirements of different types of devices, chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control have been synergistically performed. The morphology and other basic properties of multiscale OS components are governed on a broad scale from nanometers to macroscopic micrometers. Herein, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design strategies for fabricating multiscale OSs are comprehensively reviewed. Related representative works are introduced, applications in practical devices are discussed, and future research directions are presented. Design strategies combining the advances in organic synthetic chemistry and supramolecular assembly technology perform an integral role in the development of a new generation of multiscale OSs.

         <title>Electrode&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Healed Monolayer MoS2 for High Performance Transistors and Phototransistors</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel sulfide electrode system allows sulfur&#8208;vacancy self&#8208;healing in 2D MoS2. Ultrathin CuS electrode heals defects in MoS2 channel spontaneously upon mild thermal annealing. The self&#8208;healed CuS/MoS2 transistors and phototransistors show impressive device performance.








Abstract
Contact engineering for monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is considered to be of fundamental challenge for realizing high&#8208;performance TMDCs&#8208;based (opto) electronic devices. Here, an innovative concept is established for a device configuration with metallic copper monosulfide (CuS) electrodes that induces sulfur vacancy healing in the monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel. Excess sulfur adatoms from the metallic CuS electrodes are donated to heal sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 that surprisingly improve the overall performance of its devices. The electrode&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing mechanism is demonstrated and analyzed systematically using various spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and electrical measurements. Without any passivation layers, the self&#8208;healed MoS2 (photo)transistor with the CuS contact electrodes show outstanding room temperature field effect mobility of 97.6 cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1, On/Off ratio &gt; 108,&#160;low subthreshold swing of 120&#160;mV per decade, high photoresponsivity of 1 &#215; 104&#160;A W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 1013 jones, which are the best among back&#8208;gated transistors that employ 1L MoS2. Using ultrathin and flexible 2D CuS and MoS2, mechanically flexible photosensor is also demonstrated, which shows excellent durability under mechanical strain. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy in TMDCs or other 2D material for the development of high performance and functional devices including self&#8208;healable sulfide electrodes.

         <title>Tunable 2D Group&#8208;III Metal Alloys</title>

         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys with tunable composition and no evidence of phase segregation are realized by confinement heteroepitaxy. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.








Abstract
Chemically stable quantum&#8208;confined 2D metals are of interest in next&#8208;generation nanoscale quantum devices. Bottom&#8208;up design and synthesis of such metals could enable the creation of materials with tailored, on&#8208;demand, electronic and optical properties for applications that utilize tunable plasmonic coupling, optical nonlinearity, epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero behavior, or wavelength&#8208;specific light trapping. In this work, it is demonstrated that the electronic, superconducting, and optical properties of air&#8208;stable 2D metals can be controllably tuned by the formation of alloys. Environmentally robust large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys are synthesized byConfinement Heteroepitaxy (CHet). Near&#8208;complete solid solubility is achieved with no evidence of phase segregation, and the composition is tunable over the full range of x by changing the relative elemental composition of the precursor. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.

         <title>Crystallographic&#8208;Site&#8208;Specific Structural Engineering Enables Extraordinary Electrochemical Performance of High&#8208;Voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering is performed on the cathode material structure, aiming at the root causes of the instability based on the fundamental structure/function relationship. The high&#8208;voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode with Fd3&#175;m space group symmetry is employed as a representative, of which two issue&#8208;involved crystallographic sites are directly and simultaneously addressed, contributing to an extraordinarily excellent battery performance.








Abstract
The development of reliable and safe high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by the structural instability of cathode materials during cycling, arising as a result of detrimental phase transformations occurring at high operating voltages alongside the loss of active materials induced by transition metal dissolution. Originating from the fundamental structure/function relation of battery materials, the authors purposefully perform crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering on electrode material structure, using the high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode as a representative, which directly addresses the root source of structural instability of the Fd3&#175;m structure. By employing Sb as a dopant to modify the specific issue&#8208;involved 16c and 16d sites simultaneously, the authors successfully transform the detrimental two&#8208;phase reaction occurring at high&#8208;voltage into a preferential solid&#8208;solution reaction and significantly suppress the loss of Mn from the LNMO structure. The modified LNMO material delivers an impressive 99% of its theoretical specific capacity at 1 C, and maintains 87.6% and 72.4% of initial capacity after 1500 and 3000 cycles, respectively. The issue&#8208;tracing site&#8208;specific structural tailoring demonstrated for this material will facilitate the rapid development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Variability and Yield in h&#8208;BN&#8208;Based Memristive Circuits: The Role of Each Type of Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large (up to 10 kbit) crossbar arrays of nano&#8208;memristors (down to 320&#160;nm &#215; 420&#160;nm) using hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are fabricated, and their yield and variability are studied. The atomic defects in h&#8208;BN deviate the electrical characteristics of the devices, while wrinkles, polymer residues, thicker islands, and gaps with the substrate have no remarkable effect.








Abstract
In the race of fabricating solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic devices using 2D layered materials (LMs), achieving high yield and low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability are the two main challenges. Electronic devices that drive currents in&#8208;plane and homogeneously along the 2D&#8208;LMs (i.e., transistors, memtransistors) are strongly affected by local defects (i.e., grain boundaries, wrinkles, thickness fluctuations, polymer residues), as they create inhomogeneities and increase the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, resulting in a poor performance at the circuit level. Here, it is shown that memristors are insensitive to most types of defects in 2D&#8208;LMs, even when fabricated in academic laboratories that do not meet industrial standards. The reason is that the currents produced in these devices, which flow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane across the 2D&#8208;LM, are always driven locally by the most conductive locations. Consequently, it is concluded that it is much easier to fabricate 2D&#8208;LMs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic circuits using memristors than using transistors or memtransistors, not only due to the inherent simpler fabrication process (i.e., less lithography steps) but also because the local defects do not degrade the yield and variability of memristors considerably.

         <title>Multichannel Piezo&#8208;Ultrasound Implant with Hybrid Waterborne Acoustic Metastructure for Selective Wireless Energy Transfer at Megahertz Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is proposed, which integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure, multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The optimized device structure that utilizes a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator provides the advantage of ultrasound frequency selectivity for in vivo multifunctional operations.








Abstract
Ultrasound energy transfer (UET) is developed and integrated into various bioelectronics with diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring capabilities.

         <title>Suppressing Interface Strain for Eliminating Double&#8208;Slope Behaviors: Towards Ideal Conformable Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface strain between film and substrate is first found to play the crucial role in determining device ideality. The release of strain by peeling can reduce the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, which decreases oxygen doped carriers, thereby realizing ideal PFETs. The work clarifies the effect of interface strain on the device ideality, offering useful guidance for constructing ideal conformable PFETs.








Abstract
High&#8208;mobility polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) are being actively explored for applications in soft electronic skin and low&#8208;cost flexible displays because of their superior solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and stretchability. However, most of high&#8208;mobility PFETs often deviate from the idealized behavior with variable mobility, large threshold voltage, and high off&#8208;state current, which masks their intrinsic properties and significantly impedes their practical applications. Here, it is first revealed that interface strain between polymer thin film and rigid substrate plays a crucial role in determining the ideality of PFETs, and demonstrate that various ideal conformable PFETs can be successfully fabricated by releasing strain. It is found that strain in film can be released by one&#8208;step peeling strategy, which can reduce &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and suppress generation of oxygen doped carriers, thereby obtaining linearly injected charge carriers and decreased carrier concentration in channel, eventually realizing ideal PFETs. More impressively, the fabricated ideal conformable PFET array displays outstanding conformability to curved objects, and meanwhile showing excellent organic light&#8208;emitting display driving capability. The work clarifies the effect of the interface strain on the device ideality, and strain can be effectively released by a facile peeling strategy, thus offering useful guidance for the construction of ideal conformable PFETs.

         <title>The Interfacial Electronic Engineering in Binary Sulfiphilic Cobalt Boride Heterostructure Nanosheets for Upgrading Energy Density and Longevity of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of binary sulfiphilic cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron&#8208;codoped porous carbon (NBC), has been fabricated through molten salt&#8208;assisted strategy using ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;encapsulated ZIF&#8208;8 as precursors. Strong interfacial electronic interactions between CoB and NBC endow the CoB/NBC&#8208;S electrode with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities and long lifetime in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
High gravimetric, areal and volumetric capacities together with long lifetime are key indexes for the applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries in compact space. The sulfur host materials play pivotal roles in the practical deployment. Herein, one type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron&#8208;codoped porous carbon (NBC), which is constructed through molten salt&#8208;assisted strategy using ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;encapsulated ZIF&#8208;8 as precursors is reported on. Benefiting from strong interfacial electronic interactions between binary sulfiphilic CoB and porous NBC, the CoB/NBC&#8208;S electrode exhibits the excellent cycling stability with low average capacity decay of 0.013% in ultralong 1500 cycles at high rate of 5 C. Remarkably, the electrode with high sulfur content of 82 wt% and high sulfur loading of 5.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers gravimetric capacity of 1309&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, areal capacity of 7.59&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2, and volumetric capacity of 1355&#160;mA h cm&#8722;3 at 0.1 C. The favorable electrochemical performance can rival with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of those in the reported nanosheets&#8208;based sulfur cathodes. This study provides new methodology for the design of heterostructure nanosheets of metal borides to achieve energy density and longevity of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Efficient Ion Sieving in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;Nanometer Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin covalent organic framework membranes are constructed, where abundant hydrogen bonding sites are lined in the 1D sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm sized channels. The hydrogen&#8208;bond binding interaction between the hydrogen bonding sites and hydrated divalent cations are stronger than that of monovalent cations, enabling efficient metal ion sieving under concentration gradient driven.








Abstract
Membranes of sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer channels show high ion transport rates, but it remains a great challenge to design such membranes with desirable ion selectivities for ion separation applications. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with a channel size of &#8776;1.4&#160;nm and abundant hydrogen bonding sites, exhibiting efficient ion sieving properties are demonstrated. The COF membranes have high monovalent cation permeation rates of 0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and extremely low multivalent cation permeabilities, leading to high monovalent over divalent ion selectivities for K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;765, Na+/Mg2+ of &#8776;680, and Li+/Mg2+ of &#8776;217. Experimental measurements and theoretical simulations reveal that the hydrogen bonding interaction between hydrated cations and the COF channel wall governs the high selectivity, and divalent cations transport through the channel needs to overcome higher energy barriers than monovalent cations. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer sized membranes with specific interaction sites for high&#8208;efficiency ionic separation.

         <title>Nanoporous NiSb to Enhance Nitrogen Electroreduction via Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolating nitrogen and proton adsorption sites is an efficient strategy to improve the catalytic performance for electrochemical nitrogen reduction. Nanoporous NiSb provides separated binding sites for adsorption of H+ and N2, and optimizes the adsorption of nitrogen reduction reaction intermediates due to the electrons modulation of Sb to Ni, resulting in the improved NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
Ambient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is attracting extensive interest but still suffers from sluggish kinetics owing to competitive rapid hydrogen evolution and difficult nitrogen activation. Herein, nanoporous NiSb alloy is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for N2 fixation, achieving a high ammonia yield rate of 56.9 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 48.0%. Density functional theory calculations reveal that in NiSb alloy, Ni favors N2 hydrogenation while the neighboring Sb separates active sites for proton and N2 adsorption, which optimizes the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and enables an energetically favorable NRR pathway. This work indicates promising electrocatalytic application of the alloys of 3d and p block metals toward the NRR and provides an intriguing strategy to enhance the reduction of inert molecules by restraining the competitive hydrogen adsorption.

         <title>Lithium Fluoride in Electrolyte for Stable and Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering via fluorinated additives is promising to improve the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal batteries. The electrolyte in active porous LiF nanobox involves the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content (&gt;30%) solid electrolyte interphase layer to achieve a &#8776;3.5 Ah Li || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell with a specific energy of 380 Wh kg&#8722;1 under a practical carbonate electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering via fluorinated additives is promising to improve cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, an electrolyte is reported in a porous lithium fluoride (LiF) strategy to enable efficient carbonate electrolyte engineering for stable and safe Li&#8208;metal batteries. Unlike traditionally engineered electrolytes, the prepared electrolyte in the porous LiF nanobox exhibits nonflammability and high electrochemical performance owing to strong interactions between the electrolyte solvent molecules and numerous exposed active LiF (111) crystal planes. Via cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth analysis, it is revealed that the electrolyte in active porous LiF nanobox involves the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content (&gt;30%) solid electrolyte interphase layer, which enables very stable Li&#8208;metal anode cycling over one thousand cycles under high current density (4 mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, employing the porous LiF nanobox engineered electrolyte, a Li || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell is achieved with a specific energy of 380 Wh kg&#8722;1 for stable cycling over 80 cycles, representing the excellent performance of the Li&#8208;metal pouch cell using practical carbonate electrolyte. This study provides a new electrolyte engineering strategy for stable and safe Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Uncovering the Promotion of CeO2/CoS1.97 Heterostructure with Specific Spatial Architectures on Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel CeO2/CoS1.97 heterostructure electrocatalysts (CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97 and CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2) are constructed to investigate the relationships between spatial architectures and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, where different configuration endows hybrids with distinct intermediate adsorption, modulated electronic structures, and promoted electrochemical reconstruction, thus improving the OER kinetics and performances. This work sheds light on the importance of rational design and synthesis of advanced hybrid electrocatalysts with functional spatial architectures.








Abstract
Structural engineering and compositional controlling are extensively applied in rationally designing and fabricating advanced freestanding electrocatalysts. The key relationship between the spatial distribution of components and enhanced electrocatalysis performance still needs further elaborate elucidation. Here, CeO2 substrate supported CoS1.97 (CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97) and CoS1.97 with CeO2 surface decorated (CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2) materials are constructed to comprehensively investigate the origin of spatial architectures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97 exhibits a low overpotential of 264&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 due to the stable heterostructure and faster mass transfer. Meanwhile, CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2 has a smaller Tafel slope of 49&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 through enhanced adsorption of OH&#8722;, fast electron transfer, and in situ formation of Co(IV)O2 species under the OER condition. Furthermore, operando spectroscopic characterizations combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that spatial architectures play a distinguished role in modulating the electronic structure and promoting the reconstruction from sulfide to oxyhydroxide toward higher chemical valence. The findings highlight spatial architectures and surface reconstruction in designing advanced electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Biodegradable Small&#8208;Scale Swimmers for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their motion abilities, micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers are proposed as minimally invasive tools for precision healthcare applications. When designed for temporary treatments, these devices should exhibit the ability to degrade in the body with minimal disruption after accomplishing their designated tasks. Here, recent research efforts are summarized on the topic of biodegradable micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Most forms of biomatter are ephemeral, which means they transform or deteriorate after a certain time. From this perspective, implantable healthcare devices designed for temporary treatments should exhibit the ability to degrade and either blend in with healthy tissues, or be cleared from the body with minimal disruption after accomplishing their designated tasks. This topic is currently being investigated in the field of biomedical micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers. These tiny devices have the ability to move through fluids by converting physical or chemical energy into motion. Several architectures of these devices have been designed to mimic the motion strategies of nature's motile microorganisms and cells. Due to their motion abilities, these devices have been proposed as minimally invasive tools for precision healthcare applications. Hence, a natural progression in this field is to produce motile structures that can adopt, or even surpass, similar transient features as biological systems. The fate of small&#8208;scale swimmers after accomplishing their therapeutic mission is critical for the successful translation of small&#8208;scale swimmers&#8217; technologies into clinical applications. In this review, recent research efforts are summarized on the topic of biodegradable micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers for biomedical applications, with a focus on targeted therapeutic delivery.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Polymerization of In&#8208;Plane Highly Ordered Carbon Nitride Nanosheets toward Photocatalytic Mineralization of Mercaptan Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;plane highly ordered carbon nitride nanosheets with low structural defects synthesized by on&#8208;surface polymerization endows it with strong sulfation&#8208;resistant ability and good reusability for complete photocatalytic mineralization of mercaptans. This study highlights the on&#8208;surface polymerization technique which opens up the prospect of the construction of an atomically controlled nanostructure with potentially advantageous properties that cannot otherwise be synthesized.








Abstract
2D carbon nitride nanosheets have attracted ever&#8208;increasing interest in photocatalysis due to their unique structural advantages. However, the nanosheets synthesized by the traditional methods, such as post oxidation and liquid exfoliation, have suffered from in&#8208;plane disorder with abundant structural defects, which seriously counteracts their structural benefits for photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that polymer carbon nitride nanosheets with in&#8208;plane highly ordered structure (PCNNs&#8208;IHO) can be successfully prepared by on&#8208;surface polymerization of melamine on NaCl crystal surface at elevated temperatures. The NaCl crystals with relative high surface energy not only facilitate the adsorption and activation of melamine to undergo condensation reaction, but also function as unique substrates to orientate the assembly of 2D nanosheet structure. In addition, NaCl also acts as a reactant to provide Na+ doping into carbon nitride matrix, affording PCNNs&#8208;IHO with robust structural base sites. Benefiting from this structural basicity, PCNNs&#8208;IHO exhibits superior photocatalytic performance toward CH3SH mineralization under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Nanosecond&#8208;Pulsed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed pulsed operation of perovskite light emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two&#8208;fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&#8722;1m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
While metal&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high&#8208;speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.3 kA cm&#8722;2, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&#8722;2, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways.

&lt;p&gt;High-speed pulsed operation of perovskite light emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two-fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8.5 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While metal-halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high-speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8197;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8.3 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Finally, integrated distributed feedback (DFB) gratings are explored, which facilitate more directional light emission with a maximum radiance of approximately 1200 kW&#8197;sr&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&#8197;&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 8.5 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a more than two-fold enhancement to forward radiation output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Secondary Bonding Channel Design Induces Intercalation Pseudocapacitance toward Ultrahigh&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional organic electrode relies on functional groups. In this work, the organic compound 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid is used as an example to reveal that secondary bonds for molecular stacking are connected together to form 3D channels for Li+&#8208;ion intercalation. The secondary bonding channels comprising &#63743;C&#63742;C&#63743; redox sites are identified to display intercalation pseudocapacitance, playing an important role in increasing specific capacity and rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials have shown extraordinary promise for green and sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices, but usually suffer from low specific capacity and poor rate capability, which is largely caused by inactive components and diffusion&#8208;controlled Li+ intercalation. Herein, high&#8208;rate Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance in organic molecular crystals is achieved through introducing weak secondary bonding channels, far exceeding their theoretical capacity based on redox chemistry at functional groups. The authors&#8217; combined experimentally electrochemical characterization with first&#8208;principles calculations show that the heterocyclic organic molecule 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDCA) crystal permits a four&#8208;electron redox reaction at conventional &#63743;C&#63742;O and &#63743;C&#63742;N groups and a six&#8208;electron intercalation pseudocapacitance along conjugated alkene hydrogen bonding channels (&#63743;H2NC5&#63743;H&#8943;O&#63742;C(OH)&#63743;) and heterocyclic aromatic stacking channels (&#63743;C5H3N&#8943;NH3C5&#63743;). The BPDCA electrode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 and an exceptional rate capability. A 4.8&#160;V high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density BPDCA anode&#8208;based hybrid Li&#8208;ion capacitor is thus realized. This work opens a new avenue for developing organic intercalation pseudocapacitive materials via secondary bonding structure design.

         <title>Room Temperature Ferromagnetism of Monolayer Chromium Telluride with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the room temperature ferromagnetism of monolayer Cr3Te4 is reported which is not an inherently layered material. Molecular beam epitaxy allows the successful growth of 2D Cr3Te4 in the monolayer form on graphite at low substrate temperatures, e.g., &#8776;100 &#176;C, which is compatible with Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology.








Abstract
The realization of long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in 2D systems can potentially revolutionize next&#8208;generation information technology. Here, the successful fabrication of crystalline Cr3Te4 monolayers with room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism is reported. Using molecular beam epitaxy, the growth of 2D Cr3Te4 films with monolayer thickness is demonstrated at low substrate temperatures (&#8776;100 &#176;C), compatible with Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements reveal a Curie temperature (Tc) of v344 K for the Cr3Te4 monolayer with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic easy axis, which decreases to v240 K for the thicker film (&#8776;7&#160;nm) with an in&#8208;plane easy axis. The enhancement of ferromagnetic coupling and the magnetic anisotropy transition is ascribed to interfacial effects, in particular the orbital overlap at the monolayer Cr3Te4/graphite interface, supported by density&#8208;functional theory calculations. This work sheds light on the low&#8208;temperature scalable growth of 2D nonlayered materials with RT ferromagnetism for new magnetic and spintronic devices.

         <title>Randomly Induced Phase Transformation in Silk Protein&#8208;Based Microlaser Arrays for Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel physically unclonable cryptographic protocol from silk protein&#8208;based microlaser arrays is proposed, where the randomness was&#160;introduced through randomly induced phase transformation of silk protein. The microlaser array possesses the deterministic readout sites of laser signals and unrepeatable signal distribution characteristics, which can guarantee efficient authentication and high security when serving as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label.








Abstract
Anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exhibit high security with unreplicable code outputs, making them an ideal platform to realize unbreakable anticounterfeiting. Although various schemes are proposed for PUF labels, the utilization of natural randomness suffers from unpredictable signal extraction sites, which poses a challenge to efficient and convenient authentication for practical anticounterfeiting applications. Here, a covert optical PUF&#8208;based cryptographic protocol from silk protein&#8208;based microlaser (SML) arrays that possess hidden randomness of lasers for unclonable lasing signals as well as a defined location for efficient identification is proposed. The initial SMLs are patterned by casting laser dye&#8208;doped regenerated silk fibroin solution, resulting in a uniform microlaser array with regulated positions. With the SML array as substrate, random methanol microdroplets are stochastically sprayed on the SML array, which eventually induces uneven lasing signal changes of the patterned microlasers. The treated SML array possesses the deterministic readout sites of laser signals and unrepeatable signal distribution characteristics, which can guarantee efficient authentication and high security when serving as an anticounterfeiting label.

         <title>The Role of Additives in Suppressing the Degradation of Liquid&#8208;Exfoliated WS2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of liquid&#8208;exfoliated WS2 monolayers is studied in situ through photoluminescence as function of time and temperature in two surfactant systems (sodium cholate&#8212;SC; sodium dodecyl sulfate&#8212;SDS). The kinetics reveal that a photoinduced degradation (activation energy &#8776;25 kJ mol&#8722;1) is dominant in SC, while an additional thermal degradation (activation energy &#8776;50 kJ mol&#8722;1) is observed in SDS.








Abstract
Group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be chemically widely inert, but recent reports point toward an oxidation of monolayered sheets in ambient conditions, due to defects. To date, the degradation of monolayered TMDs is only studied on individual, substrate&#8208;supported nanosheets with varying defect type and concentration, strain, and in an inhomogeneous environment. Here, degradation kinetics of WS2 nanosheet ensembles in the liquid phase are investigated through photoluminescence measurements, which selectively probe the monolayers. Monolayer&#8208;enriched WS2 dispersions are produced with varying lateral sizes in the two common surfactant stabilizers sodium cholate (SC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Well&#8208;defined degradation kinetics are observed, which enable the determination of activation energies of the degradation and decouple photoinduced and thermal degradation. The thermal degradation is slower than the photoinduced degradation and requires higher activation energy. Using SC as surfactant, it is sufficiently suppressed. The photoinduced degradation can be widely prevented through chemical passivation achieved through the addition of cysteine which, on the one hand, coordinates to defects on the nanosheets and, on the other hand, stabilizes oxides on the surface, which shield the nanosheets from further degradation.

The thermal degradation is slower than the photoinduced degradation and requires higher activation energy. Using SC as surfactant, it is sufficiently suppressed. The photoinduced degradation can be widely prevented through chemical passivation achieved through the addition of cysteine which, on the one hand, coordinates to defects on the nanosheets and, on the other hand, stabilizes oxides on the surface, which shield the nanosheets from further degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Charge Density Wave Orders and Enhanced Superconductivity under Pressure in the Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4a&#160;&#215; 1a and 2a&#160;&#215; 2a charge density wave (CDW) orders are observed in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 single crystal. A dome&#8208;shaped phase diagram accompanying the suppression of CDW state reveals a complex landscape of electronic states that can co&#8208;exist on a kagome lattice and compete with superconductivity, offering a new platform to investigate the interplay between superconductivity, CDW, and nontrivial topological electronic structure.








Abstract
Superconductivity in topological kagome metals has recently received great research interests. Here, charge density wave (CDW) orders and the evolution of superconductivity under various pressures in CsV3Sb5 single crystal with V kagome lattice are investigated. By using high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), two CDW orders in CsV3Sb5 are observed which correspond to 4a&#160;&#215; 1a and 2a&#160;&#215; 2a superlattices. By applying pressure, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is significantly enhanced and reaches a maximum value of 8.2 K at around 1&#160;GPa. Accordingly, CDW state is gradually declined as increasing the pressure, which indicates the competing interplay between CDW and superconducting state in this material. The broad superconducting transitions around 0.4&#8211;0.8&#160;GPa can be related to the strong competition relation among two CDW states and superconductivity. These results demonstrate that CsV3Sb5 is a new platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and CDW in topological kagome metals.

         <title>A Highly Robust Ionotronic Fiber with Unprecedented Mechanomodulation of Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stretchable and robust ionotronic fiber comprising liquid crystal elastomer network and ionic liquid is reported. The soft chain spacers selectively anchor cations while rigid mesogens align in response to stretch leading to the formation of phase&#8208;separated low&#8208;tortuous anion&#8208;conducting nanochannels. Consequently, the ionic conductivity is unprecedentedly boosted with strain, which has never been observed in previously reported ionic conductors.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are appealing for tissue&#8208;like soft electronics, yet suffer from a tardy mechanoelectric response due to their poor modulation of ionic conduction arising from intrinsic homogeneous soft chain network. Here, a highly robust ionotronic fiber is designed by synergizing ionic liquid and liquid crystal elastomer with alternate rigid mesogen units and soft chain spacers, which shows an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ionic conductivity boost (&#8776;103 times enhanced as stretched to 2000% strain). Such a surprisingly high enhancement is attributed to the formation of microphase&#8208;separated low&#8208;tortuosity ion&#8208;conducting nanochannels guided by strain&#8208;induced emergence of aligned smectic mesophases, thus allowing for ultrafast ion transport that resembles the role of &#8220;swimming lanes.&#8221; Intriguingly, the boosting conductivity even reverses Pouillet's Law&#8208;dictated resistance increase at certain strains, leading to unique waveform&#8208;discernible strain sensing. Moreover, the fiber retains thermal actuation properties with a maximum of 70% strain changes upon heating, and enables integrated self&#8208;perception and actuation. The findings offer a promising molecular engineering route to mechanically modulate the ion transport behavior of ionic conductors toward advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage Performance of Layered Polymer Nanocomposites over a Broad Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;structured polymer nanocomposites exhibit remarkable capacitive energy storage performance, including high energy density, great charge&#8211;discharge efficiency, low driving field, and excellent dielectric stability at high electric fields and elevated temperatures. This work enables the rational design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density dielectric polymer composites with a wide working temperature range.








Abstract
To reach the full potential of polymer dielectrics in advanced electronics and electrified transportation, it calls for efficient operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density dielectric polymers under high voltages over a wide temperature range. Here, the polymer composites consisting of the boron nitride nanosheet/polyetherimide and TiO2 nanorod arrays/polyetherimide layers are reported. The layered composite exhibits a much higher dielectric constant than the current high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers and composites, while simultaneously retaining low dielectric loss at elevated temperatures and high applied fields. Consequently, the layered polymer composite presents much improved capacitive performance than the current dielectric polymers and composites over a temperature range of 25&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the excellent capacitive performance of the layered composite is achieved at an applied field that is about 40% lower than the typical field strength of the current polymer composites with the discharged energy densities of &gt;3 J cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C. Remarkable cyclability and dielectric stability are established in the layered polymer nanocomposites. This work addresses the current challenge in the enhancement of the energy densities of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers and demonstrates an efficient route to dielectric polymeric materials with high energy densities and low loss over a broad temperature range.

         <title>Anchoring Sites Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated metal atoms stabilized on various supports by surrounding atoms have emerged as a new frontier. The atomic structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs. This review provides an overview of the correlation between the property of anchoring points and catalytic performance to guide the designing of the SACs.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been at the frontier of research field in catalysis owing to the maximized atomic utilization, unique structures and properties. The atomically dispersed and catalytically active metal atoms are necessarily anchored by surrounding atoms. As such, the structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs even with the same metal element. Significant progress has been made to understand structure&#8211;activity relationships at an atomic level, but in&#8208;depth understanding in precisely designing highly efficient SACs for the targeted reactions is still required. In this review, various anchoring sites in SACs are summarized and classified into five different types (doped heteroatoms, defect sites, surface atoms, metal sites, and cavity sites). Then, their impacts on catalytic performance are elucidated for electrochemical reactions based on their distance from the metal center (first coordination shell and beyond). Further, SACs anchored on two typical types of hosts, carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based materials, are highlighted, and the effects of anchoring points on achieving the desirable atomic structure, catalytic performance, and reaction pathways are elaborated. At last, insights and outlook to the SAC field based on current achievements and challenges are presented.

         <title>Tethering Cells via Enzymatic Oxidative Crosslinking Enables Mechanotransduction in Non&#8208;Cell&#8208;Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cells need to sense their environment in order to survive and function. In this study an enzymatic crosslinking strategy that can tether non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive materials to cells is presented. By targeting the cellular adhesome, this cell&#8211;material tethering method enables cell&#8208;volume&#8208;independent lineage programming of stem cells in engineered 3D microniches with controlled stiffness.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;matrix interactions govern cell behavior and tissue function by facilitating transduction of biomechanical cues. Engineered tissues often incorporate these interactions by employing cell&#8208;adhesive materials. However, using constitutively active cell&#8208;adhesive materials impedes control over cell fate and elicits inflammatory responses upon implantation. Here, an alternative cell&#8211;material interaction strategy that provides mechanotransducive properties via discrete inducible on&#8208;cell crosslinking (DOCKING) of materials, including those that are inherently non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive, is introduced. Specifically, tyramine&#8208;functionalized materials are tethered to tyrosines that are naturally present in extracellular protein domains via enzyme&#8208;mediated oxidative crosslinking. Temporal control over the stiffness of on&#8208;cell tethered 3D microniches reveals that DOCKING uniquely enables lineage programming of stem cells by targeting adhesome&#8208;related mechanotransduction pathways acting independently of cell volume changes and spreading. In short, DOCKING represents a bioinspired and cytocompatible cell&#8208;tethering strategy that offers new routes to study and engineer cell&#8211;material interactions, thereby advancing applications ranging from drug delivery, to cell&#8208;based therapy, and cultured meat.

&lt;p&gt;Cells need to sense their environment in order to survive and function. In this study an enzymatic crosslinking strategy that can tether non-cell-adhesive materials to cells is presented. By targeting the cellular adhesome, this cell&#8211;material tethering method enables cell-volume-independent lineage programming of stem cells in engineered 3D microniches with controlled stiffness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell&#8211;matrix interactions govern cell behavior and tissue function by facilitating transduction of biomechanical cues. Engineered tissues often incorporate these interactions by employing cell-adhesive materials. However, using constitutively active cell-adhesive materials impedes control over cell fate and elicits inflammatory responses upon implantation. Here, an alternative cell&#8211;material interaction strategy that provides mechanotransducive properties via discrete inducible on-cell crosslinking (DOCKING) of materials, including those that are inherently non-cell-adhesive, is introduced. Specifically, tyramine-functionalized materials are tethered to tyrosines that are naturally present in extracellular protein domains via enzyme-mediated oxidative crosslinking. Temporal control over the stiffness of on-cell tethered 3D microniches reveals that DOCKING uniquely enables lineage programming of stem cells by targeting adhesome-related mechanotransduction pathways acting independently of cell volume changes and spreading. In short, DOCKING represents a bioinspired and cytocompatible cell-tethering strategy that offers new routes to study and engineer cell&#8211;material interactions, thereby advancing applications ranging from drug delivery, to cell-based therapy, and cultured meat.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A General Crosslinker Strategy to Realize Intrinsic Frozen Resistance of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and universal crosslinking strategy to fabricate a family of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked materials with intrinsic, built&#8208;in antifreezing and mechanical properties, but without any antifreezing additives is demonstrated. The resultant EGINA&#8208;crosslinked materials, consisting of a wide range of compositions (hydrophilies, electrolytes, zwitterions, macromolecules), enable to achieve their antifreezing properties at &#8722;20 &#176;C in solution, gel state, and hydrogel/solid interfaces.








Abstract
Development and understanding of antifreezing materials are fundamentally and practically important for materials design and delivery. However, almost all of antifreezing materials are either organic/icephobic materials containing no water or hydrophilic hydrogels containing antifreezing additives. Here, a general crosslinking strategy to fabricate a family of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked double&#8208;network hydrogels with intrinsic, built&#8208;in antifreezing and mechanical properties, but without any antifreezing additives is proposed and demonstrated. The resultant hydrogels, despite large structural and compositional variations of hydrophilies, electrolytes, zwitterions, and macromolecules of polymer chains, achieved strong antifreezing and mechanical properties in different environments including solution state, gel state, and hydrogel/solid interfaces. Such general antifreezing property of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, regardless network compositions, is likely stemmed from their highly hydrophilic and tightly crosslinked DN structures for inducing strong water&#8211;network bindings to prevent ice crystal formation from free waters in hydrogel networks. EGINA&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels can also serve as a key component to be fabricated into smart windows with high optical transmittance and supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical stability at subzero temperatures. This work provides a simple, blueprint antifreezing design concept and a family of antifreezing hydrogels for the better understanding of the composite&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship of antifreezing materials and the fundamentals of confined water in wet soft materials.

         <title>Switchable Photonic Bio&#8208;Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft photonic bio&#8208;adhesive demonstrates large reversible changes in adhesion power and mechanical strength with concurrent self&#8208;reporting colorimetric responses. This coupled behavior is derived by the humidity&#8208;driven intercalation/removal of water molecules into a glucose&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network within a liquid crystal polysaccharide matrix that triggers tightly correlated changes in mechanical strength, adhesion, and pitch length of the chiral nematic organization.








Abstract
A soft photonic bio&#8208;adhesive material is designed with real&#8208;time colorimetrical monitoring of switchable adhesion by integrating a responsive bio&#8208;photonic matrix with mobile hydrogen&#8208;binding networking. Synergetic materials sequencing creates a unique iridescent appearance directly coupled with both adhesive ability and shearing strength, in a highly reversible manner. The responsive photonic materials, having a physically hydrogen&#8208;bonded chiral nematic organization, vary their adhesion strength due to a transition in cohesive and interfacial failure mechanism in humid surroundings. The bright color appearance shifts from blue to red to transparent and back due to a change in pitch length of the chiral helicoidal organization that also triggers coupled changes in both mechanical strength and interfacial adhesion. Such reversible strength&#8208;adhesion&#8208;iridescence triple&#8208;coupling phenomenon is further explored for design of super&#8208;strong switchable bio&#8208;adhesives for synthetic/biological surfaces with quick remotely triggered sticky&#8208;to&#8208;nonsticky transitions, removable conformal soft stickers, and wound dressings with visual monitoring of the healing process, to colorimetric stickers for contaminated respiratory masks.

         <title>Fully Bottom&#8208;Up Waste&#8208;Free Growth of Ultrathin Silicon Wafer via Self&#8208;Releasing Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a fully bottom&#8208;up technique for fabricating a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate, whereas conventional technologies waste large amounts of such material. Plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxially grown silicon seed layer with self&#8208;organized nanogap is a key for realization of the fully bottom&#8208;up process. The results represent a technological breakthrough in advanced silicon microelectronics and photovoltaics.








Abstract
The fabrication of ultrathin silicon wafers at low cost is crucial for advancing silicon electronics toward stretchability and flexibility. However, conventional fabrication techniques are inefficient because they sacrifice a large amount of substrate material. Thus, advanced silicon electronics that have been realized in laboratories cannot move forward to commercialization. Here, a fully bottom&#8208;up technique for producing a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate is presented. The key to this approach is a self&#8208;organized nanogap on the substrate fabricated by plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth (plasma&#8208;epi) and subsequent hydrogen annealing. The wafer thickness can be independently controlled during the bulk growth after the formation of plasma&#8208;epi seed layer. In addition, semiconductor devices are realized using the ultrathin silicon wafer. Given the high scalability of plasma&#8208;epi and its compatibility with conventional semiconductor process, the proposed bottom&#8208;up wafer fabrication process will open a new route to developing advanced silicon electronics.

         <title>Quantifying Contact&#8208;Electrification Induced Charge Transfer on a Liquid Droplet after Contacting with a Liquid or Solid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An apparatus based on acoustic levitation is designed to measure the charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid and liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and the asymmetric transfer behavior of positive and negative charges at the oil&#8211;water interface is observed, suggesting that the electron transfer plays a dominant role in the contact electrification at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces.








Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is a common physical phenomenon, and its mechanisms for solid&#8211;solid and liquid&#8211;solid cases have been widely discussed. However, the studies about liquid&#8211;liquid CE are hindered by the lack of proper techniques. Here, a contactless method is proposed for quantifying the charges on a liquid droplet based on the combination of electric field and acoustic field. The liquid droplet is suspended in an acoustic field, and an electric field force is created on the droplet to balance the acoustic trap force. The amount of charges on the droplet is thus calculated based on the equilibrium of forces. Further, the liquid&#8211;solid and liquid&#8211;liquid CE are both studied by using the method, and the latter is focused. The behavior of negatively precharged liquid droplet in the liquid&#8211;liquid CE is found to be different from that of the positively precharged one. The results show that the silicone oil droplet prefers to receive negative charges from a negatively charged aqueous droplet rather than positive charges from a positively charged aqueous droplet, which provides a strong evidence about the dominant role played by electron transfer in the liquid&#8211;liquid CE.

         <title>Substantial P&#8208;Type Conductivity of AlN Achieved via Beryllium Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal modulated epitaxy (MME) grown Be&#8208;doped AlN shows substantial first&#8208;time experimental p&#8208;type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 1015&#8211;3.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at room temperature. The acceptor activation energy is found to be &#8776;37 meV, &#8776;8 times lower than predicted in literature but on par with MME p&#8208;type GaN. A p&#8208;AlN:Be/i&#8208;GaN:Be/n&#8208;GaN:Ge diode is demonstrated with substantial rectification.








Abstract
Beryllium has long been predicted by first principle theory as the best p&#8208;type dopant for GaN and AlN. But experimental validation of these theories has not, until now, borne out the original predictions. A key challenge is the dopant&#8208;induced strain leading to Be rejection from substitutional sites in favor of interstitial sites, leading to self&#8208;compensation. More flexible growth methods like metal modulated epitaxy (MME) that can operate at substantially lower temperatures than traditional approaches, can more effectively place Be into the proper substitutional lattice sites. MME grown Be&#8208;doped AlN shows substantial p&#8208;type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 1015&#8211;3.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at room temperature. While others have achieved sizable carrier concentrations near surfaces via carbon doping or Si implantation, this is the only known demonstration of substantial bulk p&#8208;type doping in AlN and is a nearly 1000 times higher carrier concentration than the best previously demonstrated bulk electron concentrations in AlN.

&lt;p&gt;Metal modulated epitaxy (MME) grown Be-doped AlN shows substantial first-time experimental p-type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;3.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;at room temperature.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beryllium has long been predicted by first principle theory as the best p-type dopant for GaN and AlN. But experimental validation of these theories has not, until now, borne out the original predictions. A key challenge is the dopant-induced strain leading to Be rejection from substitutional sites in favor of interstitial sites, leading to self-compensation. More flexible growth methods like metal modulated epitaxy (MME) that can operate at substantially lower temperatures than traditional approaches, can more effectively place Be into the proper substitutional lattice sites. MME grown Be-doped AlN shows substantial p-type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;3.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;at room temperature. While others have achieved sizable carrier concentrations near surfaces via carbon doping or Si implantation, this is the only known demonstration of substantial bulk p-type doping in AlN and is a nearly 1000 times higher carrier concentration than the best previously demonstrated bulk electron concentrations in AlN. The acceptor activation energy is found to be &#8776;37 meV, &#8776;8 times lower than predicted in literature but on par with similar results for MME p-type GaN. Preliminary results suggest that the films are highly compensated. A p-AlN:Be/i-GaN:Be/n-GaN:Ge pin diode is demonstrated with substantial rectification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shedding Light on the Role of Chemical Bond in Catalysis of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent developments of catalytic nitrogen fixation, digs deep into the atomic&#8208;scale insight of the reaction mechanism to clarify the ambiguity, lists powerful methods for enhancing the nitrogen fixation performance, and combines theory predictions with experimental results, all from a chemical bond perspective, which could facilitate deeper pondering and further exploration in the nitrogen fixation field.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) and nitrates are essential for human society because of their widespread utilization for producing medicines, fibers, fertilizers, etc. In recent years, the development on nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions has attracted much attention. However, the very low conversion efficiency and ambiguous catalytic mechanism remain the major hurdles for the research of nitrogen fixation. This review aims to clarify the role of chemical bond in catalytic nitrogen fixation by summarizing and analyzing the recent development of nitrogen fixation research. In detail, the atomic&#8208;scale mechanism of nitrogen fixation reaction, the various methods to improve the nitrogen fixation performance, and the computational investigation of nitrogen fixation are discussed, all from a chemical bond perspective. It is hoped that this review could trigger more profound pondering and deeper exploration in the field of catalytic nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Entropy Landscaping of High&#8208;Entropy Carbides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy carbides are designed based on valence electron concentration (VEC). VEC describes entropy, enthalpy, free energy, volume, and metastability of high entropy carbides such that a new composition thermodynamic property can be explained based on VEC.








Abstract
The entropy landscape of high&#8208;entropy carbides can be used to understand and predict their structure, properties, and stability. Using first principles calculations, the individual and temperature&#8208;dependent contributions of vibrational, electronic, and configurational entropies are analyzed, and compare them qualitatively to the enthalpies of mixing. As an experimental complement, high&#8208;entropy carbide thin films are synthesized with high power impulse magnetron sputtering to assess structure and properties. All compositions can be stabilized in the single&#8208;phase state despite finite positive, and in some cases substantial, enthalpies of mixing. Density functional theory calculations reveal that configurational entropy dominates the free energy landscape and compensates for the enthalpic penalty, whereas the vibrational and electronic entropies offer negligible contributions. The calculations predict that in many compositions, the single&#8208;phase state becomes stable at extremely high temperatures (&gt;3000 K). Consequently, rapid quenching rates are needed to preserve solubility at room temperature and facilitate physical characterization. Physical vapor deposition provides this experimental validation opportunity. The computation/experimental data set generated in this work identifies &#8220;valence electron concentration&#8221; as an effective descriptor to predict structural and thermodynamic properties of multicomponent carbides and educate new formulation selections.

         <title>A &#8220;Bridge&#8208;Building&#8221; Glycan Scaffold Mimicking Microbial Invasion for In Situ Endothelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycan substrate (GMDE) can preferentially support endothelial cells (ECs) adhesion by binding galectin&#8208;1, a carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein highly secreted by ECs, which in turn connects the substrate with the integrin receptors of the ECs. Implantation of GMDE promotes blood vessel formation in a murine ischemic model, suggesting its potential for future vascular therapy.








Abstract
The globally high prevalence of peripheral artery diseases poses a pressing need for biomaterials grafts to rebuild vasculature. When implanted, they should promote endothelial cells (ECs) adhesion both profoundly and selectively&#8212;but the latter expectation remains unfulfilled. Here, this work is inspired by fungi that invade blood vessels via the &#8220;bridge&#8221; of galectins that, secreted by ECs, can simultaneously bind carbohydrates on fungal surface and integrin receptors on ECs. A glucomannan decanoate (GMDE) substrate mimicking fungal carbohydrates that highly and preferentially supports ECs adhesion while rejecting several other cell types is designed. Electrospun GMDE scaffolds efficiently sequester endogenous galectin&#8208;1&#8212;which bridges ECs to the scaffolds as it functions in fungal invasions&#8212;and promote blood perfusion in a murine limb ischemic model. Meanwhile, the application of GMDE requires no exogenous pro&#8208;angiogenic agents and causes no organ toxicity or adverse inflammation in mice, highlighting its high safety of potential translation. This glycan material, uniquely mimicking a microbial action and harnessing a secreted protein as a &#8220;bridge,&#8221; represents an effective, safe, and different strategy for ischemic vascular therapy.

         <title>Unconstrained 3D Shape Programming with Light&#8208;Induced Stress Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing light responsive diselenide bonds into polymer films, homogeneous stress fixed by shape&#8208;memory effect could be relaxed to form a stress gradient. Once the stress gradient is activated, various deformations, including bending, folding, twisting, and helix, could be realized through the asymmetric contraction, which could be further combined for 3D shape programming, sequential deformation, and microscopic optical patterning.








Abstract
Programming 2D sheets to form 3D shapes is significant for flexible electronics, soft robots, and biomedical devices. Stress regulation is one of the most used methods, during which external force is usually needed to keep the stress, leading to complex processing setups. Here, by introducing dynamic diselenide bonds into shape&#8208;memory materials, unconstrained shape programming with light is achieved. The material could hold and release internal stress by themselves through the shape&#8208;memory effect, simplifying programming setups. The fixed stress could be relaxed by light to form stress gradients, leading to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations through asymmetric contractions. Benefiting from the variability of light irradiation, complex 3D configurations can be obtained conveniently from 2D polymer sheets. Besides, remotely controlled &#8220;4D assembly&#8221; and actuation, including object transportation and self&#8208;lifting, can be achieved by sequential deformation. Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of light, this material can also produce 3D microscopic patterns. The light&#8208;induced stress gradients significantly simplify 3D shape programming procedures with improved resolution and complexity and have great potential in soft robots, smart actuators, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques.

         <title>Controlling Liquid Crystal Orientations for Programmable Anisotropic Transformations in Cellular Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user&#8208;defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independtly at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breakings, which can be exploited to achieve switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties as well as to modulate light.








Abstract
Geometric reconfigurations in cellular structures have recently been exploited to realize adaptive materials with applications in mechanics, optics, and electronics. However, the achievable symmetry breakings and corresponding types of deformation and related functionalities have remained rather limited, mostly due to the fact that the macroscopic geometry of the structures is generally co&#8208;aligned with the molecular anisotropy of the constituent material. To address this limitation, cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user&#8208;defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independently at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breakings in cellular materials, which are demonstrated by both finite element analyses and experiments. It is illustrated that the resulting mechanical reconfigurations can be harnessed to program microcellular materials with switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties and further exploit &#8221;area&#8208;specific&#8221; deformation patterns to locally modulate transmitted light and precisely guide object movement. As such, the work provides a clear route to decouple anisotropy at the materials level from the directionality of the macroscopic cellular structure, which may lead to a new generation of smart and adaptive materials and&#160;devices.

&lt;p&gt;Cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user-defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independtly at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director-determined symmetry breakings, which can be exploited to achieve switchable and direction-dependent frictional properties as well as to modulate light.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geometric reconfigurations in cellular structures have recently been exploited to realize adaptive materials with applications in mechanics, optics, and electronics. However, the achievable symmetry breakings and corresponding types of deformation and related functionalities have remained rather limited, mostly due to the fact that the macroscopic geometry of the structures is generally co-aligned with the molecular anisotropy of the constituent material. To address this limitation, cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user-defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independently at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director-determined symmetry breakings in cellular materials, which are demonstrated by both finite element analyses and experiments. It is illustrated that the resulting mechanical reconfigurations can be harnessed to program microcellular materials with switchable and direction-dependent frictional properties and further exploit &#8221;area-specific&#8221; deformation patterns to locally modulate transmitted light and precisely guide object movement. As such, the work provides a clear route to decouple anisotropy at the materials level from the directionality of the macroscopic cellular structure, which may lead to a new generation of smart and adaptive materials and&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferromagnetic&#8211;Antiferromagnetic Coupling Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles with Spin Conservation for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell Fe3O4@Ni(OH)2 catalysts with different core sizes and shell thicknesses that mimic surface&#8208;reconstructed catalysts, are made to investigate the effect of magnetic domain structure on magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;improved oxygen evolution activity. Only the catalyst with a multiple domain core and a relatively thin shell exhibits a significant enhancement under the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Rational design of active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is critical for the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. The differing spin states of the OER reactants and products is one of the factors that slows OER kinetics. Thus, spin conservation plays a crucial role in enhancing OER performance. In this work, ferromagnetic (FM)&#8211;antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe3O4@Ni(OH)2 core&#8211;shell catalysts are designed. The interfacial FM&#8211;AFM coupling of these catalysts facilitates selective removal of electrons with spin direction opposing the magnetic moment of FM core, improving OER kinetics. The shell thickness is found critical in retaining the coupling effect for OER enhancement. The magnetic domain structure of the FM core also plays a critical role. With a multiple domain core, the applied magnetic field aligns the magnetic domains, optimizing the electron transport process. A significant enhancement of OER activity is observed for the multiple domain core catalysts. With a single&#8208;domain FM core with ordered magnetic dipoles, the spin&#8208;selective electron transport with minimal scattering is facilitated even without an applied magnetic field. A magnetism/OER activity model therefore hypothesizes that depends on two main parameters: interfacial spin coupling and domain structure. These findings provide new design principles for active OER catalysts.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Multiscale Modeling of Mechanical Properties in Graphene/Borophene Heterostructures Empowered by Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties based on machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials conveniently trainable over short ab initio datasets is proposed. It is shown that mechanical/failure responses of complex nanostructures at continuum scale and high temperatures can be explored with the precision of sophisticated first&#8208;principles calculations, affordable computational cost, and without the need for empirical data.








Abstract
Density functional theory calculations are robust tools to explore the mechanical properties of pristine structures at their ground state but become exceedingly expensive for large systems at finite temperatures. Classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations offer the possibility to study larger systems at elevated temperatures, but they require accurate interatomic potentials. Herein the authors propose the concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP&#8208;based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were&#160;the missing block for conducting first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.

         <title>2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite with Ordered Phase Distribution for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite with an ordered phase distribution is presented. The increased built&#8208;in potential due to the gradient phase distribution, oriented crystals, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of the device in the entire response spectrum range.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites exhibit great potential in optoelectronic devices for superior stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, to achieve a high level of device performance, it is crucial but challenging to regulate the phase distribution of 2D perovskites to facilitate charge carrier transfer. Herein, using a solvent additive method (adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)) combined with a hot&#8208;casting process, the phase distribution of (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (PEA+&#160;= C6H5CH2CH2NH3+, MA+&#160;= CH3NH3+) perovskite can be well controlled and the Fermi level of perovskites along the film thickness direction can achieve gradient distribution. The increased built&#8208;in potential, oriented crystal, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of devices in the entire response spectrum range. The optimum device exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 570&#160;nm with large responsivity/detectivity (0.44 A W&#8722;1/3.38 &#215; 1012 Jones), ultrafast response speed with a rise/fall time of 20.8/20.6 &#181;s, and improved stability. This work suggests the possibility of manipulating the ordered phase distribution of 2D perovskites toward high&#8208;performance and stable optoelectronic conversion devices.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Multicolor Image Sensor Based on Electrochromic Color&#8208;Radix Demultiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of a broadband color&#8208;tunable photodetector and its high&#8208;accuracy digital color&#8208;discrimination scheme is presented. Vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors demonstrates a superior capability of regulating charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths, yielding voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. An array of optoelectronic logic sensors that can demultiplex color coordinates with high color accuracy is demonstrated.








Abstract
Optical data acquisition has been set as one of the milestones to testify the developments aimed at harnessing the full potential of the spatial and temporal data processing capabilities of the advanced semiconductor technology. A highly promising approach to drive the level of acquisition beyond the current technological node is the vertical integration of multiple photodetectors. However, vertical integration so far requires the same level of circuit complexity as lateral integration from the incapability of monolithic integration. Here, an electrochromic device architecture is introduced that enables realization of a monolithic tandem multicolor photodetector. The device, composed of vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors, is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the balanced charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths. It exhibits variable anti&#8208;ambipolar charge transport behavior, which yields sensitive voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. These electrical behaviors are utilized to fabricate an optoelectronic logic sensor that can demultiplex the desired color coordinate or wavelength in the constituent array with high color accuracy.

         <title>New Insights into the High&#8208;Performance Black Phosphorus Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed black phosphorus&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotube composite (BP/G/CNTs) shows stable high&#8208;current cycling performance at 2 A g&#8722;1. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy study of this material reveals the precise reaction mechanism of BP and Li+ during cycling.








Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP) is a promising anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its high electrical conductivity and capacity. However, the huge volume change of BP during cycling induces rapid capacity fading. In addition, the unclear electrochemical mechanism of BP hinders the development of rational designs and preparation of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based anodes. Here, a high&#8208;performance nanostructured BP&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotubes composite (BP/G/CNTs) synthesized using ball&#8208;milling method is reported. The BP/G/CNTs anode delivers a high initial capacity of 1375&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.15 A g&#8722;1 and maintains 1031.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 450 cycles. Excellent high&#8208;rate performance is demonstrated with a capacity of 508.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, for the first time, direct evidence is provided experimentally to present the electrochemical mechanism of BP anodes with three&#8208;step lithiation and delithiation using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, operando XRD, and operando XAS, which reveal the formation of Li3P7, LiP, and Li3P. Furthermore, the study indicates an open&#8208;circuit relaxation effect of the electrode with ex situ and operando XAS analyses.

         <title>Highly Permeable DNA Supramolecular Hydrogel Promotes Neurogenesis and Functional Recovery after Completely Transected Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA supramolecular hydrogel carrying neural stem cells (NSCs) is applied to repair spinal cord injury. A renascent neural network is formed at the lesion site via the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Due to the newly formed synapses at the lesion area, rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials.








Abstract
Regeneration after severe spinal cord injury cannot occur naturally in mammals. Transplanting stem cells to the injury site is a highly promising method, but it faces many challenges because it relies heavily on the microenvironment provided by both the lesion site and delivery material. Although mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of delivery materials have been extensively explored, their permeability has rarely been recognized. Here, a DNA hydrogel is designed with extremely high permeability to repair a 2 mm spinal cord gap in Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats. The rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials, and a renascent neural network is formed via the proliferation and differentiation of both implanted and endogenous stem cells. The signal at the lesion area is conveyed by, on average, 15 newly formed synapses. This hydrogel system offers great potential in clinical trials. Further, it should be easily adaptable to other tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Surface Diffusion and Epitaxial Self&#8208;Planarization for Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Grain Metal Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single&#8208;grain 2D metal chalcogenides remains a challenge in the commercialization of various electronic devices based on these materials. A generalized surface&#8208;diffusion&#8208;induced epitaxial self&#8208;planarization method to produce wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenide thin films is described. This process also enables the practical applications of single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenides without involving a transfer process.








Abstract
Although wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain thin films of 2D metal chalcogenides (MCs) have been extensively sought after during the last decade, the grain size of the MC thin films is still limited in the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. A general strategy of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain MC thin films by using commercial wafers (Si, Ge, GaAs) both as metal source and epitaxial collimator is presented. A new mechanism of single&#8208;grain thin&#8208;film formation, surface diffusion, and epitaxial self&#8208;planarization is proposed, where chalcogen elements migrate preferentially along substrate surface and the epitaxial crystal domains flow to form an atomically smooth thin film. Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, the formation of single&#8208;grain Si2Te3, GeTe, GeSe, and GaTe thin films on (111) Si, Ge, and (100) GaAs is verified. The Si2Te3 thin film is used to achieve transfer&#8208;free fabrication of a high&#8208;performance bipolar memristive electrical&#8208;switching device.

         <title>A Nearly Packaging&#8208;Free Design Paradigm for Light, Powerful, and Energy&#8208;Dense Primary Microbatteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Billions of internet&#8208;connected devices require microbattery power sources, but their operating times are severely limited by the poor scaling of battery energy density. This work presents a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the majority of packaging and using thick and dense electrodes with controlled crystal orientation for fast transport.








Abstract
Billions of internet connected devices used for medicine, wearables, and robotics require microbattery power sources, but the conflicting scaling laws between electronics and energy storage have led to inadequate power sources that severely limit the performance of these physically small devices. Reported here is a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the vast majority of the packaging and through the use of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode and cathode materials. These light (50&#8211;80&#160;mg) and small (20&#8211;40&#160;&#181;L) microbatteries are enabled though the electroplating of 130&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick 94% dense additive&#8208;free and crystallographically oriented LiCoO2 onto thin metal foils, which also act as the encapsulation layer. These devices have 430&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1050&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 energy densities, 4 times the energy density of previous similarly sized microbatteries, opening up the potential to power otherwise unpowerable microdevices.

         <title>A Smartphone&#8208;Enabled Portable Digital Light Processing 3D Printer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;enabled Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printer based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a customized touchscreen smartphone app is developed, featuring portability, modularity, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use interface. The ability of printing with versatile materials covers commercial resins and several hydrogel&#8208;based (bio)inks. This platform is proven to be applicable to fabrication of medical implants, in situ bioprinting, and integration with a 3D object&#8208;scanning app.








Abstract
3D printing has emerged as an enabling approach in a variety of different fields. However, the bulk volume of printing systems limits the expansion of their applications. In this study, a portable 3D Digital Light Processing (DLP) printer is built based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a custom&#8208;written smartphone&#8208;operated app. Constructs with detailed surface architectures, porous features, or hollow structures, as well as sophisticated tissue analogs, are successfully printed using this platform, by utilizing commercial resins as well as a range of hydrogel&#8208;based inks, including poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;diacrylate, gelatin methacryloyl, or allylated gelatin. Moreover, due to the portability of the unique DLP printer, medical implants can be fabricated for point&#8208;of&#8208;care usage, and cell&#8208;laden tissues can be produced in situ, achieving a new milestone for mobile&#8208;health technologies. Additionally, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one printing system described herein enables the integration of the 3D scanning smartphone app to obtain object&#8208;derived 3D digital models for subsequent printing. Along with further developments, this portable, modular, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use smartphone&#8208;enabled DLP printer is anticipated to secure exciting opportunities for applications in resource&#8208;limited and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings not only in biomedicine but also for home and educational purposes.

         <title>Avoiding the Center&#8208;Symmetry Trap: Programmed Assembly of Dipolar Precursors into Porous, Crystalline Molecular Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic building units on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This programmed assembly yields electric fields orientated normal to the substrate. This electrostatic design creates possibilities for band structure engineering and also results in nonlinear optical activity (second&#8208;harmonic generation).








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase, quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic compounds on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This allows material fabrication with built&#8208;in electric fields. A new programmed assembly strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is described that facilitates crystalline, noncentrosymmetric space groups for achiral compounds. Electric fields are integrated into crystalline, porous thin films with an orientation normal to the substrate. Changes in electrostatic potential are detected via core&#8208;level shifts of marker atoms on the MOF thin films and agree with theoretical results. The integration of built&#8208;in electric fields into organic, crystalline, and porous materials creates possibilities for band structure engineering to control the alignment of electronic levels in organic molecules. Built&#8208;in electric fields may also be used to tune the transfer of charges from donors loaded via programmed assembly into MOF pores. Applications include organic electronics, photonics, and nonlinear optics, since the absence of inversion symmetry results in a clear second&#8208;harmonic generation signal.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Carbonous Frameworks Implanted with CdS Quantum Dots for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;supported CdS quantum dots are fabricated via an in situ transformation strategy. The as&#8208;prepared materials exhibit superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under the irradiation of visible light in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction is regarded as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, achieving high efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially without the assistance of sacrifice reagents or extra alkaline additives, remains a critical issue. Herein, a photocatalyst of 3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported CdS quantum dots (3DOM CdSQD/NC) is successfully fabricated toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction via an in situ transformation strategy. Additionally, an amines oxidation reaction is introduced to replace the H2O oxidation process to further boost the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Impressively, 3DOM CdSQD/NC exhibits superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives. Moreover, 3DOM CdSQD/NC achieves an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.9% at 450 nm. Mechanism studies indicate that the 3D ordered macropores in the NC matrix are beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the highly dispersed CdS QDs on the NC skeleton are able to significantly promote the adsorption of both CO2 and amine molecules and depress the CO2 activation energy barriers by stabilizing the *COOH intermediate, directly contributing to the high activity.

         <title>Significant Improvements in Dielectric Constant and Energy Density of Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites Enabled by Ultralow Contents of Nanofillers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric polymer nanocomposites with ultralow filler loadings exhibit considerably improved dielectric constant and breakdown strength, giving rise to remarkable discharged energy densities. A mathematical model is established to predict the dielectric constant of composites with low filler contents, revealing the significant contribution of the interphase to the polarization.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with excellent processability and high breakdown strength (Eb) enable the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Although the improvement of dielectric constant (K) of polymer dielectric has been realized by adding high&#8208;K inorganic fillers with high contents (&gt;10 vol%), this approach faces significant challenges in scalable film processing. Here, the incorporation of ultralow ratios (&lt;1 vol%) of low&#8208;K Cd1&#8722;xZnxSe1&#8722;ySy nanodots into a ferroelectric polymer is reported. The polymer composites exhibit substantial and concurrent increase in both K and Eb, yielding a discharged energy density of 26.0 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming the current dielectric polymers and nanocomposites measured at &#8804;600 MV m&#8722;1. The observed unconventional dielectric enhancement is attributed to the structural changes induced by the nanodot fillers, including transformation of polymer chain conformation and induced interfacial dipoles, which have been confirmed by density function theory calculations. The dielectric model established in this work addresses the limitations of the current volume&#8208;average models on the polymer composites with low filler contents and gives excellent agreement to the experimental results. This work provides a new experimental route to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics and also advances the fundamental understanding of the dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites at atomistic scales.

         <title>New Structure Mass Tag based on Zr&#8208;NMOF for Multiparameter and Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Interrogating in Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based mass tags as next&#8208;generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating.








Abstract
Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high&#8208;dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells. However, under the typical polymer&#8208;based mass tag system, the sensitivity and multiplexing detection ability has been highly restricted. Herein, a new structure mass tag based on a nanometal organic framework (NMOF) is reported for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating in CyTOF. A uniform&#8208;sized Zr&#8208;NMOF (33 nm)&#160;carrying 105 metal ions is synthesized under modulator/reaction time coregulation, which is monodispersed and colloidally stable in water for over one&#8208;year storage. On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross&#8208;reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr&#8208;mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, m/z&#160;= 90, 91, 92, 94, for single&#8208;cell immunoassays in CyTOF.

     alt="New Structure Mass Tag based on Zr-NMOF for Multiparameter and Sensitive Single-Cell Interrogating in Mass Cytometry"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic-framework-based mass tags as next-generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single-cell biomarker interrogating.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high-dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells. However, under the typical polymer-based mass tag system, the sensitivity and multiplexing detection ability has been highly restricted. Herein, a new structure mass tag based on a nanometal organic framework (NMOF) is reported for multiparameter and sensitive single-cell biomarker interrogating in CyTOF. A uniform-sized Zr-NMOF (33 nm)&#160;carrying 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; metal ions is synthesized under modulator/reaction time coregulation, which is monodispersed and colloidally stable in water for over one-year storage. On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross-reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr-mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 90, 91, 92, 94, for single-cell immunoassays in CyTOF. Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr-mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification. This work provides the fundamental technical capability for exploiting NMOF-based mass tags for CyTOF application, which opens up possibility of high-dimensional single-cell immune profiling, low abundant antigen detection, and development of new barcoding systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Accelerating Ion Dynamics Under Cryogenic Conditions by the Amorphization of Crystalline Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphization is an effective strategy to promote low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by promoting fast charge transfer at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface and relieving the blocking effect of dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. The synthesized amorphous organic electrode exhibits an unprecedented specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The normal operation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at ultralow temperature (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications; however, their operation is plagued by the low capacity of the conventional intercalation cathodes due to their sluggish kinetics and the slow solid diffusion of Li+ in their frameworks. Here, it is demonstrated that amorphization is an effective strategy to promote the low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by relieving the blocking effect of a dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. As a result, due to the decreased charge transport impedance and enhanced Li+ diffusion rate, the obtained covalent amorphous polymer (CAP) with an abundance of pyrazine and carbonyl active sites displays a remarkably outstanding specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to its structural analog, a covalent crystalline polymer (43.8 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 84.7% of the initial capacity of the CAP can be retained after 500 cycles of charge and discharge at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the channel&#8208;rich amorphous structure is highly conducive for lithium ions to diffuse quickly in the interstitial space of organic solids. This work provides an effective strategy regarding the amorphization of crystalline cathodes to develop low&#8208;temperature (Low&#8208;T) batteries.

         <title>Rapid Capture of Cancer Extracellular Vesicles by Lipid Patch Microarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles have great prospects as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, their isolation still poses challenges. A novel supported lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;based platform is introduced for rapid capture, with high specificity and sensitivity, only a small needed analyte volume, and without additional purification steps. The platform is flexible and can be applied to many targets by corresponding antibodies.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various bioactive molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, and play a key role in the regulation of cancer progression. Furthermore, cancer&#8208;associated EVs carry specific biomarkers and can be used in liquid biopsy for cancer detection. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming to detect or isolate cancer&#8208;associated EVs from complex biofluids (e.g., blood). Here, a novel EV&#8208;capture strategy based on dip&#8208;pen nanolithography generated microarrays of supported lipid membranes is presented. These arrays carry specific antibodies recognizing EV&#8208; and cancer&#8208;specific surface biomarkers, enabling highly selective and efficient capture. Importantly, it is shown that the nucleic acid cargo of captured EVs is retained on the lipid array, providing the potential for downstream analysis. Finally, the feasibility of EV capture from patient sera is demonstrated. The demonstrated platform offers rapid capture, high specificity, and sensitivity, with only a small need in analyte volume and without additional purification steps. The platform is applied in context of cancer&#8208;associated EVs, but it can easily be adapted to other diagnostic EV targets by use of corresponding antibodies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Vertically Aligned Bismuthene Nanosheet Arrays from Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to grow on various Cu substrates via the galvanic replacement reaction. They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between the nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO2 reduction to formate in aqueous solution.








Abstract
There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high&#8208;quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well&#8208;controlled conditions, large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and great stability.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Valent Palladium Single&#8208;Atoms Catalysts Confined in Black Phosphorus for Efficient Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;valent palladium single&#8208;atoms catalysts confined in black phosphorus are successfully synthesized via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This BP&#8208;based SAC with metallic Pd1/P shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, opening up new avenues for designing zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for a wide range of organic transformations.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their remarkable catalytic properties and maximized atomic utilization. However, single atoms often bond to the support with polarized electron density and thus exhibit a high valence state, limiting their catalytic scopes in many chemical transformations. Here, it is demonstrated that 2D black phosphorus (BP) acts as giant phosphorus (P) ligand to confine a high density of single atoms (e.g., Pd1, Pt1) via atomic layer deposition. Unlike other 2D materials, BP with relatively low electronegativity and buckled structure favors the strong confinement of robust zero&#8208;valent palladium SACs in the vacancy site. Metallic Pd1/BP SAC shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, distinct from metallic Pd nanoparticles that facilitate the formation of fully hydrogenated products. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pd atom forms covalent&#8208;like bonding with adjacent P atoms, wherein H atoms tend to adsorb, aiding the dissociative adsorption of H2. Zero&#8208;valent Pd in the confined space favors a larger energy gain for the synthesis of partially hydrogenated product over the fully hydrogenated one. This work provides a new route toward the synthesis of zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for organic transformations.

         <title>Triarylamine&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Carbonitriles for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices with EQE Nearly 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based compounds with excellent photoluminescent quantum yields (79&#8211;100%) and high horizontal dipole ratios (86&#8722;88%) in the thin films are demonstrated. With two methyl groups on the triarylamines, the spin&#8722;orbit coupling is enhanced due to the elevated locally excited triplet states (3LE), leading to a fast reverse intersystem crossing. Green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 39.8% without any optical extraction technique.








Abstract
Highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules are in urgent demand for solid&#8208;state lighting and full&#8208;color displays. Here, the design and synthesis of three triarylamine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;carbonitrile&#8208;based TADF compounds, TPAPPC, TPAmPPC, and tTPAmPPC, are shown. They exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yields of 79&#8722;100% with small &#916;EST values, fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and high horizontal dipole ratios (&#920;//&#160;= 86&#8722;88%) in the thin films leading to the enhancement of device light outcoupling. Consequently, a green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on TPAmPPC shows a high average external quantum efficiency of 38.8&#160;&#177; 0.6%, a current efficiency of 130.1&#160;&#177; 2.1&#160;cd A&#8211;1, and a power efficiency of 136.3&#160;&#177; 2.2&#160;lm W&#8211;1. The highest device efficiency of 39.8% appears to be record&#8208;breaking among TADF&#8208;based OLEDs to date. In addition, the TPAmPPC&#8208;based device shows superior operation lifetime and high&#8208;temperature resistance. It is worth noting that the TPA&#8208;PPC&#8208;based materials have excellent optical properties and the potential for making them strong candidates for TADF practical application.

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chiral liquid&#8208;crystal phase, the polar cholesteric phase, is realized. In addition to the unique dielectric property succeeded from the polar nematic host, the polar cholesteric phase is distinct from the conventional cholesteric phase due to the non&#8208;degeneracy of the local nematic director, as observed in the fundamental optical behaviors in wedge&#8208;cells or under E&#8208;fields.








Abstract
A novel chiral nematic phase with a polar helical order is realized via the introduction of helical twisting power into a polar nematogen. The properties of the induced polar nematic (polar cholesteric: Np*) phase differ from those of the conventional cholesteric (N*) phases existing thus far. Np*, which is a new class of N* structures, is characterized not only by its helically twisted nematic director, but also by a continuously twisted polarization. Transmission spectroscopy and helical pitch measurements in a wedge cell revealed that the half&#8208;helical pitch in the Np* phase vanished because of the polar response in the Np* helix. The inner polar director in the Np* phase is confirmed in dielectric and second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation studies. Furthermore, this unique Np*LC, which corresponds to a half&#8208;/full&#8208;pitch helix, enables ultrafast electro&#8208;optic switching (&#964;&#160;&lt;&#160;20&#160;&#181;s), and proposes new potential applications for electrically interchangeable photonic bandgaps.

         <title>The Manufacture of Unbreakable Bionics via Multifunctional and Self&#8208;Healing Silk&#8211;Graphene Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that transmit electricity like the human body can open new opportunities. For seamless mirroring of our&#160;anatomy, they also need to conform to its curvilinear architecture, and display self&#8208;healing ability like native organs and tissues. To address this, a conductive, adhesive, reconfigurable, and viscoelastic gum (CareGum), with promising applications in cyborganics, bionics, and soft robotics, is developed.








Abstract
Biomaterials capable of transmitting signals over longer distances than those in rigid electronics can open new opportunities for humanity by mimicking the way tissues propagate information. For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as, reproducing native&#8208;like mechanical and electrical properties combined with the ability to self&#8208;heal on demand like native organs and tissues. Along these lines, a multifunctional composite is developed by mixing silk fibroin and reduced graphene oxide. The material is coined &#8220;CareGum&#8221; and capitalizes on a phenolic glue to facilitate sacrificial and hierarchical hydrogen bonds. The hierarchal bonding scheme gives rise to high mechanical toughness, record&#8208;breaking elongation capacity of &#8776;25 000%, excellent conformability to arbitrary and complex surfaces, 3D printability, a tenfold increase in electrical conductivity, and a fourfold increase in Young's modulus compared to its pristine counterpart. By taking advantage of these unique properties, a durable and self&#8208;healing bionic glove is developed for hand gesture sensing and sign translation. Indeed, CareGum is a new advanced material with promising applications in fields like cyborganics, bionics, soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, 3D&#8208;printed electronics, and flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>Chiral Helimagnetism and One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic Solitons in a Cr&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral helimagnetism and 1D magnetic solitons are discovered in Cr&#8208;intercalated 2H&#8208;TaS2. The chiral helimagnetic structure has an initial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and it transforms into a chiral soliton lattice in an external magnetic field. The spatial period evolution of this topological spin texture obeys the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, revealing great potential for fast&#8208;speed racetrack memories.








Abstract
Chiral magnets endowed with topological spin textures are expected to have promising applications in next&#8208;generation magnetic memories. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 2D or 3D magnetic skyrmions, the authors report the discovery of 1D nontrivial magnetic solitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide 2H&#8208;TaS2 via precise intercalation of Cr elements. In the synthetic Cr1/3TaS2 (CTS) single crystal, the coupling of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction from TaS2 and the chiral arrangement of the magnetic Cr ions evoke a robust Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. A magnetic helix having a short spatial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm is observed in CTS via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, the helical spin structure transforms into a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) with the spin structure evolution being consistent with the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, which opens promising perspectives for the application of CSL to fast&#8208;speed nonvolatile magnetic memories. This work introduces a new paradigm to soliton physics and provides an effective strategy for seeking novel 2D magnets.

         <title>Penta&#8208;PdPSe: A New 2D Pentagonal Material with Highly In&#8208;Plane Optical, Electronic, and Optoelectronic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D pentagonal material, penta&#8208;PdPSe, with low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics, is introduced to the 2D family. Such a low&#8208;symmetry structure endows this material with strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, in which high conductance and photoresponsivity anisotropic ratios of 4.74 and 6.17 are achieved, respectively. These results make 2D penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.








Abstract
Due to their low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics and intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, 2D pentagonal materials, a new class of 2D materials composed entirely of pentagonal atomic rings, are attracting increasing research attention. However, the existence of these 2D materials has not been proven experimentally until the recent discovery of PdSe2. Herein, penta&#8208;PdPSe, a new 2D pentagonal material with a novel low&#8208;symmetry puckered pentagonal structure, is introduced to the 2D family. Interestingly, a peculiar polyanion of [Se&#63743;P&#63743;P&#63743;Se]4&#8722; is discovered in this material, which is the biggest polyanion in 2D materials yet discovered. Strong intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropic behavior endows penta&#8208;PdPSe with highly anisotropic optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. Impressively, few&#8208;layer penta&#8208;PdPSe&#8208;based phototransistor not only achieves excellent electronic performances, a moderate electron mobility of 21.37 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a high on/off ratio of up to 108, but it also has a high photoresponsivity of &#8776;5.07&#160;&#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 at 635&#160;nm, which is ascribed to the photogating effect. More importantly, penta&#8208;PdPSe also exhibits a large anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;max&#160;= 3.85) and responsivity (Rmax/Rmin&#160;= 6.17 at 808&#160;nm), superior to most 2D anisotropic materials. These findings make penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Design of a Self&#8208;Adhesive Agent for Durable Moisture Management and Bacterial Inhibition on PET Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mussel&#8208;inspired hydrophilic agent based on the cation&#8211;&#960; interaction is developed with strong self&#8208;adhesion on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric to form a durable superhydrophilic and antibacterial coating. It shows great potential in designing a Janus PET fabric for efficient sweat/heat management and bacterial inhibition without interfering the balance of the skin microflora, which is highly valued in physiological health and long&#8208;term wearing.








Abstract
Functional textiles with advanced moisture management can enhance human comfort and physiological health. However, conventional wet finishing processes used for textiles are usually highly polluting and exhibit poor fastness. Inspired by the strong underwater adhesion properties of mussels based on cation&#8211;&#960; interaction, a novel superhydrophilic polymeric molecule with strong cohesion and adhesion property is designed on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric. The cation&#8211;&#960; hydrophilic agent (CPHA) can efficiently transform the hydrophobic PET fabric to a superhydrophilic one, and its superhydrophilicity can withstand 150 home laundry cycles. In addition, the cationic moieties in the CPHA self&#8208;adhere to the PET fabric without any finishing auxiliary that would cause pollution. Due to its strong adhesion, CPHA can be applied to one side of the PET fabric via spray coating and curing to form a Janus hydrophobic/superhydrophilic fabric capable of diode&#8208;like one&#8208;way sweat transportation (with forward transportation capability of 1115% and backward transportation capability of &#8722;1509%). Moreover, the Janus fabric inhibits bacterial growth and invasion, while simultaneously preserving the inner ecological healthy balance of the skin's microflora. This work opens up a pathway to develop adhesives in textile wet processing for more diverse, smarter applications, e.g., quick&#8208;dry sportswear, protective suits, or air&#8208;conditioning fabrics.

         <title>Facile Production of Phosphorene Nanoribbons towards Application in Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) are prepared by a facile electrochemical exfoliation with a high yield of &gt;80%. The PNR film acts as a protective layer on a lithium&#8208;metal anode to form a Li+&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting Li3P interface that enables long&#8208;time cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Like phosphorene, phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) promises exotic properties but unzipping phosphorene into edge&#8208;defined PNR is non&#8208;trivial because of uncontrolled cutting of phosphorene along random directions. Here a facile electrochemical strategy to fabricate zigzag&#8208;edged PNRs in high yield (&gt;80%) is reported. The presence of chemically active zigzag edges in PNR allows it to spontaneously react with Li to form a Li+ ion conducting Li3P phase, which can be used as a protective layer on Li metal anode in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). PNR protective layer prevents the parasitic reaction between lithium metal and electrolyte and promotes Li+ ion diffusion kinetics, enabling homogenous Li+ ion flux and long&#8208;time cycling stability up to 1100&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4|PNR&#8208;Li full&#8208;cell batteries with an areal capacity of 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a lean electrolyte (20&#160;&#181;l&#160;mAh&#8722;1) and a negative/positive (N/P) electrodes ratio of 3.5 can be stably cycled over 100 cycles.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels for Rapid Water Disinfection and Sustainable Solar Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial hydrogels (ABHs) are designed as tablets for rapid water disinfection (&gt;99.999%) and can be easily removed from water without leaving chemical impurities. With excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be functional in solar water&#8208;purification technologies to enable stable distillate production after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. 








Abstract
Consumption of unsafe water is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing regions. Pasteurizing or boiling water to remove pathogens is energy&#8208;intensive and often impractical to off&#8208;grid communities. Therefore, low capital cost, rapid and energy&#8208;efficient water disinfection methods are urgently required to address global challenges of safe water access. Here, anti&#8208;bacterial hydrogels (ABHs) with catechol&#8208;enabled molecular&#8208;level hydrogen peroxide generators and quinone&#8208;anchored activated carbon particles are designed for effective water treatment. The bactericidal effect is attributed to the synergy of hydrogen peroxide and quinone groups to attack essential cell components and disturb bacterial metabolism. ABHs can be directly used as tablets to achieve &gt;99.999% water disinfection efficiency within 60&#160;min without energy input. No harmful byproducts are formed during the treatment process, after which the ABH tablets can be easily removed without residues. Taking advantage of their excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be applied as solar evaporators to achieve stable water purification under sunlight (&#8804;1&#160;kW m&#8722;2) after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. The ABH platform offers reduced energy and chemical demands for point&#8208;of&#8208;use water treatment technologies in remote areas and emergency rescue applications.

         <title>Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Eppur Non si Muove: A Critical Evaluation of Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>

The &gt;105 discrepancy between recent reports of proton diffusion constants in halide perovskites is analyzed and it is found that the lower value is likely correct. The higher diffusion rate determined from single crystals may be the result of high&#8208;diffusivity pathways.








Abstract
A recent report by Cahen and co&#8208;workers is examined that finds the diffusion constant for proton migration in methylammonium lead triiodide single crystals to be 2 &#215; 105&#8208;fold greater than that previously reported by Sadhu et&#160;al. By comparing the conversion of single crystals versus microcrystalline samples, it is concluded that proton diffusion in macroscopic single crystals is accelerated by the presence of defects acting as high&#8208;diffusivity paths.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Measure What is Measurable, and Make Measurable What is Not So: Discrepancies between Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films</title>

What can explain the 105 times difference higher value of the proton diffusion coefficient in iodide perovskite single crystals relative to other reported values in thin films? Instead of migration through imperfections, which is shown to be highly improbable, experimentally testable alternatives are proposed.








Abstract
Buffeteau et&#160;al. note that the proton diffusion coefficient in MAPbI3 that is deduced (by the authors) from results, obtained by a suite of complementary techniques, on a large number of single crystals (Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2002467) is 5 orders of magnitude higher than what is estimated (by them) in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 10431, from infrared spectroscopy on ultrathin MAPbI3 films; use of (deuterium/hydrogen) D/H isotope substitution is common to both studies. Buffeteau et&#160;al. speculated that proton diffusion in halide perovskite single crystals is dominated by 1D defects, which will somehow not be present in thin films, as those are made up of small&#8208;sized crystallites. It is shown here that the idea of a 1D defect is not supported by the body of experimental data gathered on these crystals, that the statistical analysis employed in to Buffeteau et&#160;al. to support the criticism is problematic, and it is concluded that the source of the difference must lie elsewhere. Constructive suggestions for this difference are provided and experiments to discern between possible reasons for it are proposed.

Perovskite Photodetectors
In article number 2101714, Wei Tian, Liang Li, and co&#8208;workers report a practical method to adjust the phase distribution in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites to construct efficient and stable perovskite photodetectors. The ordered arrangement of phase compositions facilitates the separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers, and endows the device with improved performance and environmental stability.

Microbatteries
The proliferation and performance of physically small electronics have been severely limited by the microbatteries that power them. In article number 2101760, John B. Cook, Paul V. Braun, James H. Pikul, and co&#8208;workers report a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density through the use of thick and near&#8208;fully dense electrodeposited cathodes and multifunctional current collectors that eliminate most of the hermetic packaging.

Biocompatible Materials
The history of biomaterials began with naturally derived materials such as nacre and animal tissues. Gradually mankind developed more advanced materials such as metals, ceramics, alloys and polymers to yield prosthetics and implants. Flexible and reconfigurable materials such as &#8220;CareGum&#8221; are slowly changing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by yielding flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces (e.g., bionic eyes, brain implants, heart patches, and bionic wearables (like the electronic glove developed by Alireza Dolatshahi&#8208;Pirouz in article number 2100047)).

&lt;p&gt;The history of biomaterials began with naturally derived materials such as nacre and animal tissues. Gradually mankind developed more advanced materials such as metals, ceramics, alloys and polymers to yield prosthetics and implants. Flexible and reconfigurable materials such as &#8220;CareGum&#8221; are slowly changing the current state-of-the-art by yielding flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces (e.g., bionic eyes, brain implants, heart patches, and bionic wearables (like the electronic glove developed by Alireza Dolatshahi-Pirouz in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202100047"&gt;2100047&lt;/a&gt;)).

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order (Adv. Mater. 35/2021)</title>

Liquid Crystals
A new class of cholesteric phase with local polar order is realized by Fumito Araoka and Hiroya Nishikawa in article number 2101305. In general, the periodicity of the conventional cholesteric liquid crystal corresponds to the half&#8208;pitch of the helix, having head&#8208;and&#8208;tail symmetry in the local nematic director. On the other hand, the newly found polar cholesteric liquid crystal is characterized with a full&#8208;pitch periodicity of the helix due to the polar degeneracy in the local nematic director. This delivers some unprecedented properties, such as fast electro&#8208;optic response based on the photonic band modulated with polar helix deformation.

         <title>Materials with Electroprogrammable Stiffness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel applications, such as soft robotics and haptics, require emerging material systems whose stiffness can be selectively programmed using an electrical input to increase performance and simplify designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials with electroprogrammable stiffness are reviewed, categorizing them into those governed by electrostatics and phase&#8208;changes, and identifying challenges and opportunities toward the next generation of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots. The numerous applications for materials with electrically driven stiffness modulation has driven a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Here, a comprehensive review of the available materials that realize electroprogrammable stiffness is provided, showing that all current approaches can be categorized as using electrostatics or electrically activated phase changes, and summarizing the advantages, limitations, and applications of these materials. Finally, a perspective identifies state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art trends and an outlook of future opportunities for the development and use of materials with electroprogrammable stiffness.

Respiration carries a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. An overview of TENG&#8208;enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion monitoring and chemical breath analysis, is presented.








Abstract
In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths, which has traditionally been an underutilized resource potentially encompassing a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low&#8208;cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG&#8208;based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part. Then the sensing mechanism, theoretical modeling, and applications related to detection of chemicals released from breathing gases are systemically summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of triboelectric effect enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring are comprehensively discussed and criticized.

         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are discussed according to their different roles ranging from power supplies to self&#8208;powered active sensors. TENG&#8208;based sensor systems with new principles, structures, or applications are highlighted. The discussion is from the perspective of classical analytical chemistry, based on elements such as target molecules and probes. Finally, some limitations and challenges are mentioned.








Abstract
The rapid advances in the Internet of things and wearable devices have created a massive platform for sensor systems that detect chemical or biological agents. The accelerated development of these devices in recent years has simultaneously aggravated the power supply problems. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a thriving renewable energy technology with the potential to revolutionize this field. In this review, the significance of TENG&#8208;based sensor systems in chemical or biological detection from the perspective of the development of power supply for biochemical sensors is discussed. Further, a range of TENGs are classified according to their roles as power supplies and/or self&#8208;powered active sensors. The TENG powered sensor systems are further discussed on the basis of their framework and applications. The working principles and structures of different TENG&#8208;based self&#8208;powered active sensors are presented, along with the classification of the sensors based on these factors. In addition, some representative applications are introduced, and the corresponding challenges are discussed. Finally, some perspectives for the future innovations of TENG&#8208;based sensor systems for chemical/biological detection are discussed.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Tunneling Devices&#8212;From Electric&#8208;Field Driven to Optical&#8208;Field Driven</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast electron tunneling devices are summarized. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based electron transport devices, electron tunneling devices can provide, significantly, much faster response time due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs on femtosecond timescales. The central tenet of optical&#8208;field&#8208;driven tunneling devices is realizing sub&#8208;optical&#8208;cycle response lightwave electronics.








Abstract
The search for ever higher frequency information processing has become an area of intense research activity within the micro, nano, and optoelectronics communities. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based diffusive transport electron devices, electron tunneling devices provide significantly faster response times due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs at sub&#8208;femtosecond timescales. As a result, the enhanced performance of electron tunneling devices is demonstrated, time and again, to reimagine a wide variety of traditional electronic devices with a variety of new &#8220;lightwave electronics&#8221; emerging, each capable of reducing the electron transport channel transit time down to attosecond timescales. In response to unprecedented rapid progress within this field, here the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in electron tunneling devices is reviewed, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and possible future research directions are identified.

         <title>Energy Autonomous Sweat&#8208;Based Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweat&#8208;based energy harvesting and storage devices, along with the key components of sweat&#8208;based energy autonomous wearables systems are comprehensively reviewed. Various considerations such as the power management and the sweat extraction, etc., are discussed for continuous operation of sweat&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
The continuous operation of wearable electronics demands reliable sources of energy, currently met through Li&#8208;ion batteries and various energy harvesters. These solutions are being used out of necessity despite potential safety issues and unsustainable environmental impact. Safe and sustainable energy sources can boost the use of wearables systems in diverse applications such as health monitoring, prosthetics, and sports. In this regard, sweat&#8208; and sweat&#8208;equivalent&#8208;based studies have attracted tremendous attention through the demonstration of energy&#8208;generating biofuel cells, promising power densities as high as 3.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, storage using sweat&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based supercapacitors with energy and power densities of 1.36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and sweat&#8208;activated batteries with an impressive energy density of 67 Ah kg&#8722;1. A combination of these energy generating, and storage devices can lead to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables capable of providing sustainable power in the &#181;W to mW range, which is sufficient to operate both sensing and communication devices. Here, a comprehensive review covering these advances, addressing future challenges and potential solutions related to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables is presented, with emphasis on sweat&#8208;based energy storage and energy generation elements along with sweat&#8208;based sensors as applications.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Rich MnSb2Te4: A Topological Insulator with Magnetic Gap Closing at High Curie Temperatures of 45&#8211;50 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;rich MnSb2Te4 is shown to exhibit ferromagnetic hysteresis with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy and Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K. It is a topological insulator with Dirac point close to the Fermi level and a magnetic gap that closes at the Curie temperature. These favorable properties are caused by excess Mn that substitutes Sb within the septuple layers.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic topological insulators exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect, which is potentially useful for high&#8208;precision metrology, edge channel spintronics, and topological qubits. &#160;The stable 2+ state of Mn enables intrinsic magnetic topological insulators. MnBi2Te4 is, however, antiferromagnetic with 25 K N&#233;el temperature and is strongly n&#8208;doped. In this work, p&#8208;type MnSb2Te4, previously considered topologically trivial, is shown to be a ferromagnetic topological insulator for a few percent Mn excess. i) Ferromagnetic hysteresis with record Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K, ii) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, iii) a 2D Dirac cone with the Dirac point close to the Fermi level, iv) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy, and v) a magnetically induced bandgap closing at the Curie temperature, demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), are shown. Moreover, a critical exponent of the magnetization &#946;&#160;&#8776; 1 is found, indicating the vicinity of a quantum critical point. Ab initio calculations reveal that Mn&#8211;Sb site exchange provides the ferromagnetic interlayer coupling and the slight excess of Mn nearly doubles the Curie temperature. Remaining deviations from the ferromagnetic order open the inverted bulk bandgap and render MnSb2Te4 a robust topological insulator and new benchmark for magnetic topological insulators.

         <title>Force&#8208;Based Wetting Characterization of Stochastic Superhydrophobic Coatings at Nanonewton Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning droplet adhesion microscopy and micropipette&#8208;based droplet friction measurements are used for quantitative evaluation of the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings. These novel force&#8208;based characterization techniques provide a detailed picture of the wetting performance and heterogeneity of super&#8208;repellent surfaces, far beyond what is afforded by traditional contact angle measurements.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic coatings have extraordinary properties like self&#8208;cleaning and staying dry, and have recently appeared on industrial and consumer markets. The stochastic nature of the coating components and coating processes (e.g., spraying, painting) affects the uniformity of the water repellency across the coated substrate. The wetting properties of those coatings are typically quantified on macroscale using contact angle goniometry (CAG). Here, highly sensitive force&#8208;based methods, scanning droplet adhesion microscopy (SDAM), and micropipette force sensor (MFS), are used, to quantify the microscale heterogeneity in the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings with irregular surface topography that cannot be investigated by CAG. By mapping the wetting adhesion forces with SDAM and friction forces with MFS, it is demonstrated that even the best coatings on the market are prone to heterogeneities that induce stick&#8211;slip motion of droplets. Thus, owing to their high spatial and force resolution, the advantages of these techniques over CAG are demonstrated.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionally Graded Composite Assembled Using Cellulose Nanocrystals and Genetically Engineered Proteins with Controlled Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formulation of a graded multiphase nanocomposite that mimics key molecular and architectural features of the mantis shrimp dactyl club in the complex shape of dental implant crown, exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and toughness, is reported. The material consists of expanded helicoidaly organized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins regulating both binding to CNCs and the growth of reinforcing apatite crystals.








Abstract
Nature provides unique insights into design strategies evolved by living organisms to construct robust materials with a combination of mechanical properties that are challenging to replicate synthetically. Hereby, inspired by the impact&#8208;resistant dactyl club of the stomatopod, a mineralized biocomposite is rationally designed and produced in the complex shapes of dental implant crowns exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and fracture toughness. This material consists of an expanded helicoidal organization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins that regulate both binding to CNCs and in situ growth of reinforcing apatite crystals. Critically, the structural properties emerge from controlled self&#8208;assembly across multiple length scales regulated by rational engineering and phase separation of the protein components. This work replicates multiscale biomanufacturing of a model biological material and also offers an innovative platform to synthesize multifunctional biocomposites whose properties can be finely regulated by colloidal self&#8208;assembly and engineering of its constitutive protein building blocks.

         <title>Programmable Multistable Perforated Shellular</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multidirectional multistable shellular metamaterials are developed by adding perforations on the Schwarz Primitive surface, where introducing elliptical holes can lead to the motif's structural bistability, while n&#8208;layer staggered perforations contribute to a maximum of 2n&#8722;1 stable states. Independent three&#8208;directional multistable perforated shellulars are demonstrated using transformations of a staggered perforated motif along the three orthogonal coordinate directions.








Abstract
Developing bistable metamaterials has recently offered a new design paradigm for deployable structures and reusable dampers. While most bistable mechanisms possess inclined/curved struts, a new 3D multistable shellular metamaterial is developed by introducing delicate perforations on the surface of Schwarz's Primitive shellular, integrating the unique properties of shellular materials such as high surface area, stiffness, and energy absorption with the multistability concept. Denoting the fundamental snapping part by motif, certain shellular motifs with elliptical perforations exhibit mechanical bistability. To bring the concept of multistability to a single motif, multistable shellular motifs are developed by introducing multilayer staggered perforations that form hinges and facilitate local instability. Adopting an n&#8208;layer staggered perforation (n hinges) design leads to a maximum 2n&#8722;1 stable states within one shellular motif during loading and unloading. Three&#8208;directional multistable shellulars are attained by extending the perforation design in three orthogonal directions. Harnessing snap&#8208;through and snap&#8208;back behaviors and self&#8208;contact, the introduced multistable perforated shellulars exhibit strong rigidity both in loading and unloading, and enhanced energy dissipation. The introduced design strategy opens up new horizons for creating multidirectional multistable metamaterials with load bearing capabilities for applications in soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing architectures, and reusable and deployable energy absorbers/dampers.

         <title>Ultrathin PdAuBiTe Nanosheets as High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Catalysts for a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin quaternary PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D&#160;nanosheets are first achieved by a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template strategy. As high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, the PdAuBiTe nanosheets can greatly increase power densities and durability in direct methanol fuel cell devices. The maximum power densities of PdAuBiTe nanosheets are up to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8211;2 in O2/air, respectively.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D metal nanostructures have sparked a lot of research interest because of their improved electrocatalytic properties for fuel cells. So far, no effective technique for preparing ultrathin 2D Pd&#8208;based metal nanostructures with more than three compositions has been published. Herein, a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template technique for producing PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D ultrathin nanosheets is developed. The mass activity of the PdAuBiTe nanosheets against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 2.48 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.5/17.7 times that of industrial Pd/C/Pt/C, respectively. After 10&#160;000 potential cyclings, there is no decrease in ORR activity. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets exhibit high methanol tolerance and in situ anti&#8208;CO poisoning properties. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets, as cathode electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells, can thus give significant improvement in terms of power density and durability. In O2/air, the power density can be increased to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, higher than that reported in previous work, and which is 2.32/3.59 times higher than Pt/C.

         <title>Constructing Graphitic&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Bonded Pentagons in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Graphene Matrix toward Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 m HClO4 is reported, with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials with high electrocatalytic activity are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in several renewable energy systems. However, the performance of carbon&#8208;based materials is far inferior to that of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in acid electrolytes. Here, a novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst is reported toward ORR in 0.1 m HClO4 with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability (100 h reaction time)&#160;than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of the carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy characterizations confirm the formation of GN&#8208;bonded pentagons in this carbon material. Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the activity is linearly associated with the amounts of both pentagons and adjacent GN atoms. Density function theory further demonstrates that adjacent GN atoms significantly increase the charge density at the carbon atom of a GN&#8208;bonded pentagon, which is the activity origin for the ORR.

         <title>Ambulatory Cardiovascular Monitoring Via a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Textile Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A waterproof textile&#8208;based wearable cardiovascular monitoring system is developed via a systematical integration of a triboelectric sensor, a signal processing circuit, a Bluetooth module, and a customized user&#8208;friendly APP interface. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, this system can perform continuous blood pressure monitoring against body motion and perspiration.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics for continuous and reliable pulse wave monitoring against body motion and perspiration remains a great challenge and highly desired. Here, a low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high&#8208;fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 &#181;A kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built&#8208;in algorithm is developed for one&#8208;click health data sharing and data&#8208;driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.

&lt;p&gt;Wearable bioelectronics for continuous and reliable pulse wave monitoring against body motion and perspiration remains a great challenge and highly desired. Here, a low-cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high-fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal-to-noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 &#181;A kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built-in algorithm is developed for one-click health data sharing and data-driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing new donor/acceptor materials and combining a ternary blending strategy, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is achieved. It is demonstrated that finely tuning the light utilization and photophysical processes of the active layer has great potential for further improving the PCEs of OPV cells.








Abstract
Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) is important for broadening the applications of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single&#8208;junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor named PBQx&#8208;TF and a new low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9&#8208;2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F&#8208;BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high&#8208;performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.

Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single-junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide-bandgap polymer donor named PBQx-TF and a new low-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9-2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F-BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open-circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short-circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and fill factor of 0.809.
