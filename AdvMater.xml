         <title>Piezoelectric&#8208;Enhanced Nanocatalysts Trigger Neutrophil N1 Polarization against Bacterial Biofilm by Disrupting Redox Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signaling provides an emerging strategy for anti&#8208;infective treatment. Here, the MOF nanocatalytic system induces a strong antibacterial response by triggering redox homeostasis imbalance in both of the bacteria and neutrophils, and initiate neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment.








Abstract
Strategies of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signals have revolutionized therapeutics involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, certain diseases with dual resistance barriers to the attacks by both ROS and immune cells, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants, are difficult to eradicate by a single exogenous oxidative stimulus due to the diversity and complexity of the redox species involved. Here, this work demonstrates that metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles capable of disrupting the bacterial ROS&#8208;defense system can dismantle bacterial redox resistance and induce potent antimicrobial immune responses in a mouse model of surgical implant infection by simultaneously modulating redox homeostasis and initiating neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment. Mechanistically, the piezoelectrically enhanced MOF triggers ROS production by tilting the band structure and acts synergistically with the aurintricarboxylic acid loaded within the MOF, which inhibits the activity of the cystathionine &#947;&#8208;cleaving enzyme. This leads to biofilm structure disruption and antigen exposure through homeostatic imbalance and synergistic activation of neutrophil N1 polarization signals. Thus, this study provides an alternative but promising strategy for the treatment of antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilm infections.

         <title>Thresholding Computing with Heterogeneous Integration of Memristive Kernel with Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Capacitor for Temporal Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated thresholding kernel with two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS) metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) for precise thresholding in time&#8208;series data. This kernel system demonstrates an improved detection scheme in ECG analysis and achieved high accuracy in spoken digit classification, utilizing the capacitive thresholding to enhance memristive event detection ability for bio&#8208;indicator applications.








Abstract
Precise event detection within time&#8208;series data is increasingly critical, particularly in noisy environments. Reservoir computing, a robust computing method widely utilized with memristive devices, is efficient in processing temporal signals. However, it typically lacks intrinsic thresholding mechanisms essential for precise event detection. This study introduces a new approach by integrating two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and one Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS)&#160;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) to implement a tunable thresholding function. The current&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of memristors combined with the capacitance&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of the capacitor forms the basis of the 2M1MOS kernel system. The proposed kernel hardware effectively records feature&#8208;specified information of the input signal onto the memristors through capacitive thresholding. In electrocardiogram analysis, the memristive response exhibited a more than ten&#8208;fold difference between arrhythmia and normal beats. In isolated spoken digit classification, the kernel achieved an error rate of only 0.7% by tuning thresholds for various time&#8208;specific conditions. The kernel is also applied to biometric authentication by extracting personal features using various threshold times, presenting more complex and multifaceted uses of heartbeats and voice data as bio&#8208;indicators. These demonstrations highlight the potential of thresholding computing in a memristive framework with heterogeneous integration.

         <title>Suppressing Hole Accumulation Through Sub&#8208;Nanometer Dipole Interfaces in Hybrid Perovskite/Organic Solar Cells for Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Photon Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In hybrid perovskite/organic solar cells (HSCs), the interface between the perovskite and organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) is carefully engineered with dipole interfacial layers (DILs). These DILs form strong interfacial dipoles, effectively reducing energy barriers and suppressing hole accumulation. Additionally, DILs enhance near&#8208;infrared photon harvesting and charge transport, boosting efficiency to 24.0% and achieving stability of 1200&#160;h under extreme moisture conditions.








Abstract
The potential of hybrid perovskite/organic solar cells (HSCs) is increasingly recognized owing to their advantageous characteristics, including straightforward fabrication, broad&#8208;spectrum photon absorption, and minimal open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss. Nonetheless, a key bottleneck for efficiency improvement is the energy level mismatch at the perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) interface, leading to charge accumulation. In this study, it is demonstrated that introducing a uniform sub&#8208;nanometer dipole layer formed of B3PyMPM onto the perovskite surface effectively reduces the 0.24&#160;eV energy band offset between the perovskite and the donor of BHJ. This strategic modification suppresses the charge recombination loss, resulting in a noticeable 30&#160;mV increase in the VOC and a balanced carrier transport, accompanied by a 5.0% increase in the fill factor. Consequently, HSCs that achieve power conversion efficiency of 24.0% is developed, a new record for Pb&#8208;based HSCs with a remarkable increase in the short&#8208;circuit current of 4.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to enhanced near&#8208;infrared photon harvesting.

         <title>Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Interface Induced Internal Electric Fields for Electrochromic Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 nanosheets with abundant amorphous/crystalline heterointerfaces (A/C&#8208;TiO2) are constructed. The alignment of Fermi levels of amorphous and crystalline TiO2 domains can introduce an internal electric field and therefore reduce the diffusion energy barrier of Li+. Consequently, it shortens the response time and improves the coloration efficiency.








Abstract
Balancing optical modulation and response time is crucial for achieving high coloration efficiency in electrochromic materials. Here, internal electric fields are introduced to titanium dioxide nanosheets by constructing abundant amorphous&#8208;crystalline interfaces, ensuring large optical modulation while reducing response time and therefore improving coloration efficiency. Aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) reveals the presence of numerous amorphous&#8208;crystalline phase boundaries in titanium dioxide nanosheets. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) exhibits an intense surface potential distribution, demonstrating the presence of internal electric fields. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterointerfaces can generate internal electric fields and reduce diffusion barriers of lithium ions. As a result, the amorphous&#8208;crystalline titanium dioxide nanosheets exhibit better coloration efficiency (35.1&#160;cm2&#160;C&#8722;1) than pure amorphous and crystalline titanium dioxide nanosheets.

         <title>Topologically Close&#8208;Packed Frank&#8208;Kasper C15 Phase Intermetallic Ir Alloy Electrocatalysts Enables High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unconventional Frank&#8208;Kasper intermetallic C15&#8208;Ir2M (M = rare earth metals) nanocrystals is prepared as hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts, which features higher Ir&#8208;M coordination numbers and electron&#8208;rich environment. The C15&#8208;Ir2Ce/C||IrO2 system in a practical PEMWE requires only a cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V to achieve the industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 and can keep stable for 1000&#160;h at 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Chemical synthesis of unconventional topologically close&#8208;packed intermetallic nanocrystals (NCs) remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation of large volume asymmetry between the components. Here, a series of unconventional intermetallic Frank&#8208;Kasper C15 phase Ir2M (M = rare earth metals La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Tm) NCs is successfully prepared via a molten&#8208;salt assisted reduction method as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared to the disordered counterpart (A1&#8208;Ir2Ce), C15&#8208;Ir2Ce features higher Ir&#8208;Ce coordination number that leads to an electron&#8208;rich environment for Ir sites. The C15&#8208;Ir2Ce catalyst exhibits excellent and pH&#8208;universal HER activity and requires only 9, 16, and 27&#160;mV overpotentials to attain 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, representing one of the best HER electrocatalysts ever reported. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the C15&#8208;Ir2Ce cathode achieves an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V at 80&#160;&#176;C and can operate stably for 1000 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 50 &#181;V h&#8722;1. Theoretical investigations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ir sites intensify the polarization of *H2O intermediate on C15&#8208;Ir2Ce, thus lowering the energy barrier of the water dissociation and facilitating the HER kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;A series of unconventional Frank-Kasper intermetallic C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M (M = rare earth metals) nanocrystals is prepared as hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts, which features higher Ir-M coordination numbers and electron-rich environment.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical synthesis of unconventional topologically close-packed intermetallic nanocrystals (NCs) remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation of large volume asymmetry between the components. Here, a series of unconventional intermetallic Frank-Kasper C15 phase Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M (M = rare earth metals La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Tm) NCs is successfully prepared via a molten-salt assisted reduction method as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).

The C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce catalyst exhibits excellent and pH-universal HER activity and requires only 9, 16, and 27&#160;mV overpotentials to attain 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, representing one of the best HER electrocatalysts ever reported.

         <title>Robust Electric&#8208;Field Control of Colossal Exchange Bias in CrI3 Homotrilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust electric&#8208;field control of exchange bias (EB)&#160;effect and magnetism transition is realized in a pure CrI3 homotrilayer. The doping from the Y&#8208;doped HfO2 substrate alters the interlayer coupling of intrinsic CrI3 trilayer and further causes the EB effect. The gate voltage reverses the magnetization direction layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer in homotrilayer CrI3, leading to a colossal EB modulation of 0.48 T.








Abstract
Controlling exchange bias (EB) by electric fields is crucial for next&#8208;generation magnetic random access memories and spintronics with ultralow energy consumption and ultrahigh speed. Multiferroic heterostructures have been traditionally used to electrically control EB and interfacial ferromagnetism through weak/indirect coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric films. However, three major bottlenecks (lattice mismatch, interface defects, and weak/indirect coupling in multiferroic heterostructures) remain, resulting in only a few tens of milli&#8208;tesla EB field. Here, this study reports a robust electric&#8208;field control recipe to dynamically tailor the EB effect in a pure CrI3 homotrilayer on a ferroelectric Y&#8208;doped HfO2 (HYO) substrate, and demonstrate a colossal and tunable EB field (HE) from &#8722;0.15 to +0.33 T, giving rise to an EB modulation of 0.48 T. The charge doping due to ferroelectric HYO film divides a homo&#8208;configuration of CrI3 homotrilayer into one antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer CrI3 and one ferromagnetic (FM) monolayer CrI3, favoring direct exchange coupling. The synergies of charge doping and electric field induce a transition of magnetic orders from AFM to FM phase in bilayer CrI3, which is also supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, leading to the robust electric control of colossal EB effect. The results therefore open numerous opportunities for exploring 2D spintronics, memories, and braininspired in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Interface/Dipole Polarized Antibiotics&#8208;Loaded Fe3O4/PB Nanoparticles for Non&#8208;Invasive Therapy of Osteomyelitis Under Medical Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a microwave (MW)&#8208;responsive magnetically targeted composite PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent combined with MTT/MDT/CT is developed for the eradication of acute osteomyelitis infected by S aureus. PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent improved dielectric loss and optimized impedance matching, which improved MW absorption capacity. Due to interfacial polarization and dipole polarization effects, PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent could generate ROS, thus it has MW catalytic performance.








Abstract
Due to their poor light penetration, photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy are ineffective in treating deep tissue infections, such as osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Here, a microwave (MW)&#8208;responsive magnetic targeting composite system consisting of ferric oxide (Fe3O4)/Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles, gentamicin (Gent), and biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) is reported. The PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent complex is used in combination with MW thermal therapy (MTT), MW dynamic therapy (MDT), and chemotherapy (CT) to treat acute osteomyelitis infected with S. aureus&#8208;infected. The powerful antibacterial effect of the PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent is determined by the synergistic effects of heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the Fe3O4/PB nanoparticles under MW irradiation and the effective release of Gent at the infection site via magnetic targeting. The antibacterial mechanism of the PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent under MW irradiation is analyzed using bacterial transcriptome RNA sequencing. The MW heat and ROS reduce the activity of the protein transporters on the bacterial membrane, along with the transport of various ions and the acceleration of phosphate metabolism, which can lead to increased permeability of the bacterial membrane, damage the ribosome and DNA, and accompany the internal protein efflux of the bacteria, thus effectively killing the bacteria.

AMV@NanoCip, a novel biomimetic nanomedicine, integrates PBP2a antibody&#8208;presenting nanovesicles with self&#8208;assembled ciprofloxacin nanoparticles exhibiting sonodynamic properties. This formulation demonstrates exceptional MRSA&#8208;targeting and antibacterial efficacy, achieving 99.99% sterilization in vitro and significant bacterial reduction in a pneumonia model. The sequential treatment strategy, combining adhesion, membrane disruption, and synergistic therapy, presents a promising approach for combating bacterial infections.








Abstract
Bacterial&#8208;induced lower respiratory tract infections are a growing global health concern, exacerbated by the inefficacy of conventional antibiotics and delivery methods to effectively target the lower respiratory tract, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. To address this challenge, this work engineers PBP2a antibody&#8208;presenting membrane nanovesicles (AMVs) specifically designed to target the penicillin&#8208;binding protein variant on the surface of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Concurrently, this work develops pure ciprofloxacin nanoparticles (NanoCip) that, for the first time, exhibits exceptional self&#8208;generated sonodynamic properties, attributed to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, while maintaining their inherent pharmacological efficacy. These NanoCip particles are integrated with AMVs to create a novel biomimetic nanomedicine, AMV@NanoCip. This formulation demonstrated remarkable MRSA&#8208;targeting affinity in both in vitro and in vivo models, significantly enhancing antibacterial activity. Upon ultrasound stimulation, AMV@NanoCip achieves over 99.99% sterilization of MRSA in vitro, with a reduction exceeding 5.14 Log CFU. Prokaryotic transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the synergistic mechanisms by which AMV@NanoCip, coupled with ultrasound, disrupts the MRSA exoskeleton. In a MRSA&#8208;induced pneumonia animal model, AMV@NanoCip+US results in a substantial bacterial load reduction in the lungs (99.99%, 4.02 Log CFU). This sequential treatment strategy (adhesion&#8208;membrane disruption&#8208;synergistic therapy) offers significant promise as an innovative therapeutic approach for combating bacterial infections.

         <title>Supramolecular Architectures of Dendritic Polymers Provide Irreversible Inhibitor to Block Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work introduces functional antiviral polymers that can bind to virus particles and inhibit their interaction with cells. The antiviral polymers can inhibit the cell infection irreversibly only when self&#8208;assembled into 2D supramolecular structures. Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit the virus reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution.








Abstract
In Nature, most known objects can perform their functions only when in supramolecular self&#8208;assembled from, e.g. protein complexes and cell membranes. Here, a dendritic polymer is presented that inhibits severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) with an irreversible (virucidal) mechanism only when self&#8208;assembled into a Two&#8208;dimmensional supramolecular polymer (2D&#8208;SupraPol). Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution. Upon assembly, 2D&#8208;SupraPol shows a remarkable half&#8208;inhibitory concentration (IC50 30&#160;nM) in vitro and in vivo in a Syrian Hamster model has a good efficacy. Using cryo&#8208;TEM, it is shown that the 2D&#8208;SupraPol has a controllable lateral size that can be tuned by adjusting the pH and use small angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering to unveil the architecture of the supramolecular assembly. This functional 2D&#8208;SupraPol, and its supramolecular architecture are proposed, as a prophylaxis nasal spray to inhibit the virus interaction with the respiratory tract.

&lt;p&gt;The work introduces functional antiviral polymers that can bind to virus particles and inhibit their interaction with cells. The antiviral polymers can inhibit the cell infection irreversibly only when self-assembled into 2D supramolecular structures. Monomeric analogs of the dendritic polymer can only inhibit the virus reversibly, thus allowing for the virus to regain infectivity after dilution.

         <title>Fiber Optic&#8208;Mediated Type I Photodynamic Therapy of Brain Glioblastoma Based on an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy that harnesses a less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type I aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer and a modified optical fiber is developed for the first time to implement exceptional photodynamic therapy in the hypoxic glioblastoma after circumventing the light blockage from skin, skull, and tissues.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. The current standard&#8208;of&#8208;care is highly invasive with strong toxic side effects, leading to poor prognosis and high mortality. As a safe and effective clinical approach, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a suitable option for GBM. Nevertheless, its implementation is significantly impeded by the limits of light penetration depth and the firm reliance on oxygen. To overcome these challenges, herein, a promising strategy that harnesses a modified optical fiber and less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type I aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) is developed for the first time to realize in vivo GBM treatments. The proposed AIE PS, namely TTTMN, characterized by a highly twisted molecular architecture and a bulky spacer, exhibits enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission and strong production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals at the aggregated state, thus affording efficient fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided PDT once formulated into nanoparticles. The inhibition of orthotopic and subcutaneous GBM xenografts provides compelling evidence of the treatment efficacy of Type I PDT irradiated through a tumor&#8208;inserted optical fiber. These findings highlight the substantially improved therapeutic outcomes achieved through fiber optic&#8208;mediated Type I PDT, positioning it as a promising therapeutic modality for GBM.

         <title>Conjugated Polymer&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Crosslinker for Efficient Photo&#8208;Patterning of Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conjugated polymer&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinker, PN3, with phenyl&#8208;substituted azide groups in the side chains, is developed for efficient photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors with superior performance, featuring a significantly low UV light exposure dose, high sensitivity (S), and high contrast (&#947;).








Abstract
Photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors using photo&#8208;crosslinkers has shown potential for organic circuit fabrication via solution processing techniques. However, the performance of patterning, including resolution (R), UV light exposure dose, sensitivity (S), and contrast (&#947;), remains unsatisfactory. In this study, a novel conjugated polymer based photo&#8208;crosslinker (PN3, Figure 1a) is reported for the first time, which entails phenyl&#8208;substituted azide groups in its side chains. Due to the potential &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the conjugated backbone of PN3 and those of polymer semiconductors, PN3 exhibits superior miscibility with polymer semiconductors compared to the commonly used small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinker 4Bx (Figure 1a). Consequently, photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors with PN3 demonstrates improved performance with much lower UV light exposure dose, higher S and higher &#947; compared to 4Bx. By utilizing electron beam lithography, patterned arrays of polymer semiconductors with resolutions down to 500&#160;nm and clearer edges are successfully fabricated using PN3. Furthermore, patterned arrays of PDPP4T, the p&#8208;type semiconductor (Figure 1b), after being doped, can function as source&#8208;drain electrodes for fabricating field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with comparable charge mobility and significantly lower sub&#8208;threshold swing value compared to those with gold electrodes.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Supercapacitors Based on a Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Conducting Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The n&#8208;type conjugated polymer PBDF offers new prospects for energy storage applications, showcasing both desirable performance and stability without the need for additives or binders and relying on environmentally friendly solutions. It is possible to combine PBDF with the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K to fabricate asymmetric cells with excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Environmentally&#8208;benign materials play a pivotal role in advancing the scalability of energy storage devices. In particular, conjugated polymers constitute a potentially greener alternative to inorganic&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based materials. One challenge to wider implementation is the scarcity of n&#8208;doped conducting polymers to achieve full cells with high&#8208;rate performance. Herein, this work demonstrates the use of a self&#8208;doped n&#8208;doped conjugated polymer, namely poly(benzodifurandione) (PBDF), for fabricating aqueous supercapacitors. PBDF demonstrates a specific capacitance of 202 &#177; 3 F&#160;g&#8722;1, retaining 81% of the initial performance over 5000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1 in 2&#160;m NaCl(aq). PBDF demonstrates rate performances of up to 100 and 50 A&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1 and 2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Electrochemical impedance analysis reveals a surface&#8208;mediated charge storage mechanism. Improvements can be achieved by adding reduced graphene oxide (rGO), thereby obtaining a specific capacitance of 288 &#177; 8 F&#160;g&#8722;1 and high&#8208;rate operation (270 A&#160;g&#8722;1). The performance of PBDF is examined in symmetric and asymmetric membrane&#8208;less cells, demonstrating high&#8208;rate performance, while retaining 83% of the initial capacitance after 100&#160;000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1. PBDF thus offers new prospects for energy storage applications, showcasing both desirable performance and stability without the need for additives or binders and relying on environmentally friendly solutions.

         <title>Electrolyte Solvation Engineering Stabilizing Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Battery With 4.0&#160;V&#8208;Class Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A WSAS electrolyte is designed by creating robust solvation clusters during the dynamic solvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which relies on the balanced interplay between ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;solvent interactions. This design facilitates the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich CEI and SEI, enabling commercial anode&#8208;free pouch cells to retain 80% of their capacity after 50 cycles.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are regarded as the &#8220;ceiling&#8221; for current sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high&#8208;voltage cathode and anode&#8208;free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion&#8208;stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+&#8208;solvent and Na+&#8208;anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0&#160;V&#8208;class layered oxide cathode from &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi&#8208;layer anode&#8208;free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This work takes a pivotal step for the further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Na batteries.

However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high-voltage cathode and anode-free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion-stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-solvent and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0&#160;V-class layered oxide cathode from &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi-layer anode-free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This work takes a pivotal step for the further development of high-energy-density Na batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Poly(Ionic Liquid) for Direct and Continuous Production of Pure Formic Acid from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth&#8208;poly(ionic liquid) (Bi&#8208;PIL) hybrid exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion to pure formic acid from flue gas via electrochemical CO2RR process. PIL coating improves CO2 adsorption and lowers the activation barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation. The integrated process shows significantly reduced cost compared to a decoupled process.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to close the carbon cycle and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, traditional decoupled CO2RR processes involve energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture, conversion, and product separation, which increases operational costs. Here, we report the development of a bismuth&#8208;poly(ionic liquid) (Bi&#8208;PIL) hybrid catalyst that exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion to formate. The Bi&#8208;PIL catalyst achieves over 90% Faradaic efficiency for formate over a wide potential range, even at low 15% v/v CO2 concentrations typical of industrial flue gas. The biphenyl in PIL backbone affords hydrophobicity while maintaining high ionic conductivity, effectively mitigating the flooding issues. The PIL layer plays a crucial role as a CO2 concentrator and co&#8208;catalyst that accelerates the CO2RR kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of Bi&#8208;PIL catalysts in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) electrolyzer for the continuous and direct production of pure formic acid solutions from flue gas. Techno&#8208;economic analysis suggests that this integrated process can produce formic acid at a significantly reduced cost compared to the traditional decoupled approaches. This work presents a promising strategy to overcome the challenges associated with low&#8208;concentration CO2 utilization and streamline the production of valuable liquid fuels and chemicals from CO2.

         <title>An Ultrastable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Battery Using a Covalent Organic Framework Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;based covalent organic framework (HATP&#8208;PT COF) material is synthesized as an anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries. Due to the stable framework and hydrogen&#8208;bond coordinated mechanism, such HATP&#8208;PT COF can deliver an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. This study offers insights for the design of future anodes for aqueous ammonium ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries have garnered significant research interest due to their safety and sustainability advantages. However, the development of reliable ammonium&#8208;based full batteries with consistent electrochemical performance, particularly in terms of cycling stability, remains challenging. A primary issue stems from the lack of suitable anode materials, as the relatively large NH4+ ions can cause structural damage and material dissolution during battery operation. To address this challenge, an Aza&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) material is introduced as an anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries. This material exhibits superior ammonium storage capabilities compared to existing anode materials. It operates effectively within a negative potential range of 0.3 to&#8210;1.0 V versus SCE, achieves high capacity even at elevated current densities (&#8776;74 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1), and demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining a capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, by pairing this COF anode with a Prussian blue cathode, an ammonium rocking&#8208;chair full battery is developedd that maintains 89% capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported ammonium ion full batteries. This study offers insights for the design of future anodes for ammonium ion batteries and holds promise for high&#8208;energy storage solutions.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Disruption&#8208;Induced Multi&#8208;Scale Mediating Strategy for Anticoagulation in Blood&#8208;Contacting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;scale mediation coating strategy is proposed to simultaneously inhibit nanoscale coagulation factors and resist aggregation of microscale thrombi. Surface force measurements reveal that the coating disrupts the thrombi skeleton, and in vivo intubation experiments in rabbits show significantly reduced thromboinflammation, promising for the long&#8208;term anticoagulation of blood&#8208;contacting devices.








Abstract
Minimally invasive blood&#8208;contacting interventional devices are increasingly used to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the risk of device&#8208;related thrombosis remains a significant concern, particularly the formation of cycling thrombi, which pose life&#8208;threatening risks. To better understand the interactions between these devices and blood, the initial stages of coagulation contact activation on extrinsic surfaces are&#160;investigated. Direct force measurements reveals that activated contact factors stimulate the intrinsic coagulation pathway and promote surface crosslinking of fibrin. Furthermore, fibrin aggregation is disrupted by surface&#8208;grafted inhibitors, as confirmed by ex vivo coagulation tests. An engineered serum protein with zwitterion grafts to resist the deposition of biological species such as fibrin, platelets, and red blood cells is also developed. Simultaneously, a protease inhibitor&#8208;based coacervate is incorporated into the coating to inhibit the intrinsic pathway effectively. The loaded coacervate can be released and reloaded through modulation of catechol&#8208;amine interactions, facilitating material regeneration. The strategy offers a novel multi&#8208;scale mediation strategy that simultaneously inhibits nanoscale coagulation factors and resists microscale thrombus aggregation, providing a long&#8208;term solution for anticoagulation in blood&#8208;contacting devices.

         <title>An Intelligent Intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip for Rapid Screening of Probiotics with Relief&#8208;Enteritis Function</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC figure shows an advanced intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system integrated with machine learning for efficient, high&#8208;throughput probiotic screening to treat enteritis. This system supports intestinal cell&#8211;probiotic coculture and generates multimodal datasets. Machine learning then analyzes these datasets to detect subtle therapeutic differences among probiotic strains, ranking their effectiveness for cost&#8208;effective, accurate screening.








Abstract
Screening probiotics with specific functions is essential for advancing probiotic research. Current screening methods primarily use animal studies or clinical trials, which are inefficient and costly in terms of time, money, and labor. An intelligent intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip integrating machine learning (ML) is developed to screen relief&#8208;enteritis functional probiotics. A high&#8208;throughput microfluidic chip combined with environment control systems provides a standardized and scalable intestinal microenvironment for multiple probiotic cocultures. An unsupervised ML&#8208;based score analyzer is constructed to accurately, comprehensively, and efficiently evaluate interactions between 12 Bifidobacterium strains and host cells of the colitis model in the intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chips. The most effective contender, Bifidobacterium longum 3&#8211;14, is discovered to relieve intestinal inflammation and enhance epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. A distinct advantage of this strategy is that it can intelligently differentiate small therapeutic variations in probiotic strains and prioritize their efficacies, allowing for economical, efficient, accurate functional probiotics screening.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen electrocatalysis acts as a pivotal circle of many green energy technologies, while the sluggish dynamic behavior restricts their development and device applications. This review deeply analyzes the structure&#8211;activity relationships (including geometric morphology and chemical structures) of oxygen electrocatalysts by combining experimental results, advanced characterizations, and theoretical simulations, favorably promoting the industrialization of oxygen electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Oxygen electrocatalysis, as the pivotal circle of many green energy technologies, sets off a worldwide research boom in full swing, while its large kinetic obstacles require remarkable catalysts to break through. Here, based on summarizing reaction mechanisms and in situ characterizations, the structure&#8211;activity relationships of oxygen electrocatalysts are emphatically overviewed, including the influence of geometric morphology and chemical structures on the electrocatalytic performances. Subsequently, experimental/theoretical research is combined with device applications to comprehensively summarize the cutting&#8208;edge oxygen electrocatalysts according to various material categories. Finally, future challenges are forecasted from the perspective of catalyst development and device applications, favoring researchers to promote the industrialization of oxygen electrocatalysis at an early date.

         <title>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)&#8208;Inspired Fully Printed Soft Pressure Sensor Array with Self&#8208;Adaptive Pressurization for Highly Reliable Individualized Long&#8208;Term Pulse Diagnostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system to enable 3D reconstruction of the pulse.








Abstract
Reliable, non&#8208;invasive, continuous monitoring of pulse and blood pressure is essential for the prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases. However, the pulse wave varies drastically among individuals or even over time in the same individual, presenting significant challenges for the existing pulse sensing systems. Inspired by pulse diagnosis methods in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), this work reports a self&#8208;adaptive pressure sensing platform (PSP) that combines the fully printed flexible pressure sensor array with an adaptive wristband&#8208;style pressure system can identify the optimal pulse signal. Besides the detected pulse rate/width/length, &#8220;Cun, Guan, Chi&#8221; position, and &#8220;floating, moderate, sinking&#8221; pulse features, the PSP combined with a machine learning&#8208;based linear regression model can also accurately predict blood pressure such as systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure values. The developed diagnostic platform is demonstrated for highly reliable long&#8208;term monitoring and analysis of pulse and blood pressure across multiple human subjects over time. The design concept and proof&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;concept demonstrations also pave the way for the future developments of flexible sensing devices/systems for adaptive individualized monitoring in the complex practical environments for personalized medicine, along with the support for the development of digital TCM.

         <title>Lateral Heterostructures Fabricated via Artificial Pressure Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for portable preparation of lateral heterostructures using artificial pressure gradients has been designed. Taking violet phosphorus as a case, the controllable pressure gradient generated by diamond anvil cells is utilized to fabricate the violet/blue phosphorus and violet/black phosphorus lateral heterostructures.








Abstract
Hydrostatic conditions are generally pursued in high&#8208;pressure research, maintained to prevent the intrinsic pressure gradient on the culets of diamond anvil cells (DACs) from introducing heterogeneity to the structure and physical properties of the regulated materials. Here, a pioneering route to fabricate lateral heterostructures is proposed via artificial pressure gradients intentionally designed in DACs. Under the tailored pressure gradients, different structural phases emerge in distinct parts of the material, resulting in the formation of heterostructures. Harnessing the polymorphic transition nature of violet phosphorus under high pressure, violet/blue and violet/black phosphorus lateral heterostructures with different electrical properties have been successfully prepared by the pressure gradient method. This achievement highlights the potential of artificial pressure gradients as a portable and universal strategy for the fabrication of lateral heterostructures, shedding new light on the preparation and regulation of lateral heterostructures across a wider range of materials.

         <title>Topological Synthesis of 2D High&#8208;Entropy Multimetallic (Oxy)hydroxide for Enhanced Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative topological strategy is developed for preparing 2D multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, including ternary CoFeZn, quaternary CoFeMnZn, and high&#8208;entropy CoFeMnCuZn. The key to the synthesis lies in using Ca&#8208;rich brownmillerite oxide as a precursor. The presence of Zn in the multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide initiates a lattice oxidation mechanism for efficient and durable oxygen evolution reaction catalysis.








Abstract
Owing to sluggish reaction kinetics and high potential, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability. Herein, an innovative topological strategy is presented for preparing 2D multimetallic (oxy)hydroxide, including ternary CoFeZn, quaternary CoFeMnZn, and high&#8208;entropy CoFeMnCuZn. The key to the synthesis lies in using Ca&#8208;rich brownmillerite oxide as a precursor, which possesses inherent structural flexibility enabling tailored elemental adjustments and topologically transforms from a point&#8208;shared structure of metal&#8208;oxygen octahedrons into an edge&#8208;shared structure under alkaline conditions. The presence of Zn in the catalysts causes a shift in the center of the O2p band toward the Fermi level, resulting in more Co4+ species, which drive holes into oxygen ligands to promote intramolecular oxygen coupling. The triggered lattice oxidation mechanism is identified by detecting peroxo&#8208;like (O22&#8722;) negative species using tetramethylammonium chemical probe, along with 18O isotope labeling experiments. As a result, the catalyst demonstrates an overpotential of 267&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, ranking it among the top&#8208;performing non&#8208;Ni&#8208;based catalysts. Importantly, the catalysts also show high Fe&#8208;leaching resistance during OER compared to conventional NiFe and CoFe hydroxides/(oxy)hydroxides. The assembled zinc&#8208;air battery enables stable operation for over 225 h at a low charging voltage of 1.93&#160;V.

         <title>A Perspective on Electrochemical Point Source Utilization of CO2 and Other Flue Gas Components to Value Added Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective covers the material design strategies for the Electrochemical Point Source Utilization of CO2 and Other Flue Gas Components to Value Added Chemicals. It also highlights how lab&#8208;scale catalysis can be translated to real&#8208;time industrial level consumption of flue gas mixture by electrochemical catalysis.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has been explored extensively for mitigation of noxious CO2 gas generating C1 and C2+ hydrocarbons and oxygenates as value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals with remarkable selectivity. The source of CO2 being a pure CO2 feed, it does not fully satisfy the real&#8208;time digestion of industrial exhausts. Besides the detrimental effect of noxious gas mixture leading to global warming, there is a huge capital investment in purifying the flue gas mixtures from industries. The presence of other impurity gases affects the eCO2RR mechanism and its activity and selectivity toward C2+ products dwindle drastically. Impurities like NOx, SOx, O2, N2, and halide ions present in flue gas mixture reduce the conversion and selectivity of eCO2RR significantly. Instead of wiping out these impurities via separation processes, new strategies from material chemistry and electrochemistry can open new avenues for turning foes to friends! In this perspective, the co&#8208;electroreduction will vividly discussed and supporting role of different heteroatom&#8208;containing impurity gases with CO2, generating highly stable C&#9472;N, C&#9472;S, C&#9472;X bonds, and highlight the existing limitations and providing probable solutions for attaining further success in this field and translating this to industrial exhaust streams.

In this work, maleimide&#8208; and styrene&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) macromers are used to prepare photocrosslinked hydrogels along a continuum of network topologies, from step&#8208; to chain&#8208;growth. This simple approach provides precise control over hydrogel nanostructure, decoupling gel modulus and diffusivity from the initial polymer content and presenting new opportunities for (bio)materials science and the study of soft matter physics.








Abstract
Hydrogels are often synthesized through photoinitiated step&#8208;, chain&#8208;, and mixed&#8208;mode polymerizations, generating diverse network topologies and resultant material properties that depend on the underlying network connectivity. While many photocrosslinking reactions are available, few afford controllable connectivity of the hydrogel network. Herein, a versatile photochemical strategy is introduced for tuning the structure of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels using macromolecular monomers functionalized with maleimide and styrene moieties. Hydrogels are prepared along a gradient of topologies by varying the ratio of step&#8208;growth (maleimide dimerization) to chain&#8208;growth (maleimide&#8208;styrene alternating copolymerization) network&#8208;forming reactions. The initial PEG content and final network physical properties (e.g., modulus, swelling, diffusivity) are tailored in an independent manner, highlighting configurable gel mechanics and reactivity. These photochemical reactions allow high&#8208;fidelity photopatterning and 3D printing and are compatible with 2D and 3D cell culture. Ultimately, this photopolymer chemistry allows facile control over network connectivity to achieve adjustable material properties for broad applications.

         <title>Unlocking Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Through Ru&#8211;Sn Dual Metal Sites and a Novel Hydroxyl Spillover Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO2 NS electrocatalyst, with optimized Ru&#8211;Sn sites for water dissociation and hydrogen adsorption and SnO2&#8208;induced unique hydroxyl spillover, enhances the alkaline hydrogen evolution by accelerating hydroxyl transfer and protecting active sites.








Abstract
Alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has great potential in practical hydrogen production but is still limited by the lack of active and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, the efficient water dissociation process, fast transfer of adsorbed hydroxyl and optimized hydrogen adsorption are first achieved on a cooperative electrocatalyst, named as Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO2 NS, in which the Ru&#8211;Sn dual metal sites and SnO2 heterojunction are constructed based on porous Ru nanosheet. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ infrared spectra suggest that Ru&#8211;Sn dual sites can optimize the water dissociation process and hydrogen adsorption, while the existence of SnO2 can induce the unique hydroxyl spillover effect, accelerating the hydroxyl transfer process and avoiding the poison of active sites. As results, Ru&#8211;Sn/SnO2 NS display remarkable alkaline HER performance with an extremely low overpotential (12&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and robust stability (650&#160;h), much superior to those of Ru NS (27&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 90&#160;h stability) and Ru&#8211;Sn NS (16&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 120&#160;h stability). The work sheds new light on designing of efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst.

         <title>Microfiber Actuators With Hot&#8208;Pressing&#8208;Programmable Mechano&#8208;Photothermal Responses for Electromagnetic Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hot&#8208;pressing&#8208;programmable microfiber&#8208;film actuator is developed with mechano&#8208;photothermal cooperativities and electromagnetic radiation perceptivity (sensitivity of 99.73% &#177; 0.15%). It demonstrates superior actuation response with mechanical/thermal/electrical stability, and realizes an amphibious robot with land&#8211;water adaptive locomotion for electromagnetic dynamic detection. This microstructure&#8208;dominated electromagnetic&#8208;perceptive actuator can inspire a new direction of environment&#8208;interactive smart materials, and soft robots with multi&#8208;scenario adaptivity and autonomous environment perceptivity.








Abstract
Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is a ubiquitous harm and hard to detect dynamically in multiple scenarios. A mechano&#8208;photothermal cooperative microfiber film (MFF) actuator is developed that can synchronously detect EMR with high reliability. The programmable actuation is deployed by a hot&#8208;pressing methodology, achieving the MFF with moderate modulus (378&#160;MPa) and superior toughness (87.26&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that ensure superior response (0.068&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) and bending curvature (0.63&#160;cm&#8722;1). A secondary hot&#8208;pressing can further program the actuation behavior with black phosphorus local photothermal enhancement patterns to achieve 2D&#8211;3D transformable geometries. An amphibious robot with a land&#8211;water adaptive locomotion mechanism is designed by programming the MFFs. It can crawl on land and locomote on water with a velocity up to &#8776;1.8&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1, and &#8776;2.39&#160;cm&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively. Employing the conductive fabric layer of the actuator with electromagnetic induction effect, the amphibious robot can synchronously perceive environmental EMR with sensitivity up to 99.73%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.15% during locomotion, with superior adaptability to EMR source intensity (0.1 to 3000&#160;W) and distance (&#8776;9&#160;m) compared to a commercial EMR detector. This EMR detective microfiber actuator can inspire a new direction of environment&#8208;interactive smart materials, and soft robots with multi&#8208;scenario adaptivity and autonomous environment perceptivity.

         <title>Bioinspired Homonuclear Diatomic Iron Active Site Regulation for Efficient Antifouling Osmotic Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by structural and functional models of natural cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), the conformations of the 2 hemes intrinsic to CcO can inspire the biomimetic active site regulation of nanozymes with powerful ROS generation capability for efficient antifouling osmotic energy conversion is demonstrated. The power density of bioinspired membranes reached 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and the antimicrobial performance increased 44.5&#8208;fold.








Abstract
Membrane&#8208;based reverse electrodialysis is globally recognized as a promising technology for harnessing osmotic energy. However, its practical application is greatly restricted by the poor anti&#8208;fouling ability of existing membrane materials. Inspired by the structural and functional models of natural cytochrome c oxidases (CcO), the first use of atomically precise homonuclear diatomic iron composites as high&#8208;performance osmotic energy conversion membranes with excellent anti&#8208;fouling ability is demonstrated. Through rational tuning of the atomic configuration of the diatomic iron sites, the oxidase&#8208;like activity can be precisely tailored, leading to the augmentation of ion throughput and anti&#8208;fouling capacity. Composite membranes featuring direct Fe&#8208;Fe motif configurations embedded within cellulose nanofibers (CNF/Fe&#8208;DACs&#8208;P) surpass state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CNF&#8208;based membranes with power densities of ca. 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and a 44.5&#8208;fold enhancement in antimicrobial performance. Combined, experimental characterization and density functional theory simulations reveal that homonuclear diatomic iron sites with metal&#8208;metal interactions can achieve ideally balanced adsorption and desorption of intermediates, thus realizing superior oxidase&#8208;like activity, enhanced ionic flux, and excellent antibacterial activity.

Combined, experimental characterization and density functional theory simulations reveal that homonuclear diatomic iron sites with metal-metal interactions can achieve ideally balanced adsorption and desorption of intermediates, thus realizing superior oxidase-like activity, enhanced ionic flux, and excellent antibacterial activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the use of grayscale DLP 3D printing to fabricate polymeric composites with tailored conductivity. By manipulating light intensity and incorporating lithium ions, the process enables the creation of materials with conductivity differences exceeding three orders of magnitude, paving the way for low&#8208;cost, rapid production of intricate electronic circuits and sensors.








Abstract
Fabricating polymeric composites with desirable characteristics for electronic applications is a complex and costly process. Digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing emerges as a promising technique for manufacturing intricate structures. In this study, polymeric samples are fabricated with a conductivity difference exceeding three orders of magnitude in various portions of a part by employing grayscale DLP (g&#8208;DLP) single&#8208;vat single&#8208;cure 3D printing deliberate resin design. This is realized through the manipulation of light intensity during the curing process. Specifically, the rational resin design with added lithium ions results in the polymer cured under the maximum UV&#8208;light intensity exhibiting higher electrical resistance. Conversely, sections that are only partially cured retains uncured monomers, serving as a medium that facilitates ion mobility, consequently leading to higher conductivity. The versatility of g&#8208;DLP allows precise control of light intensity in different regions during the printing process. This characteristic opens up possibilities for applications, notably the low&#8208;cost, facile, and rapid production of complex electrical circuits and sensors. The utilization of this technique makes it feasible to fabricate materials with tailored conductivity and functionality, providing an innovative pathway to advance the accelerated and facile creation of sophisticated electronic devices.

         <title>Sustainable Nanofibril Interfaces for Strain&#8208;Resilient and Multimodal Porous Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous, soft bioelectronics are breathable and offer long&#8208;term biocompatibility, but face challenges in stability under stretching and sweat management. This study uses cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) as interfaces to improve strain resilience and printing quality on porous substrates. In addition, CNF&#8208;based microfluidics enables continuous sweat monitoring, resulting in a multimodal bioelectronic system for tracking energy metabolism and consumption.








Abstract
Porous soft bioelectronics have attracted significant attention due to their high breathability, long&#8208;term biocompatibility, and other unique features inaccessible in nonporous counterparts. However, fabricating high&#8208;quality multimodal bioelectronic components that operate stably under strain on porous substrates, along with integrating microfluidics for sweat management, remains challenging. In this study, cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) are explored, biomass&#8208;derived sustainable biomaterials, as nanofibril interfaces with unprecedented interfacial robustness to enable high&#8208;quality printing of strain&#8208;resilient bioelectronics on porous substrates by reducing surface roughness and creating mechanical heterogeneity. Also, CNF&#8208;based microfluidics can provide continuous sweat collection and refreshment, crucial for accurate biochemical sensing. Building upon these advancements, a multimodal porous wearable bioelectronic system is further developed capable of simultaneously detecting electrocardiograms and glucose and beta&#8208;hydroxybutyrate in sweat for monitoring energy metabolism and consumption. This work introduces novel strategies for fabricating high&#8208;quality, strain&#8208;resilient porous bioelectronics with customizable multimodalities to meet arising personalized healthcare needs.

         <title>Bifunctionally Electrocatalytic Bromine Redox Reaction by Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Performance Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mesoporous carbon framework with dispersed single iron atom coordinated with nitrogen atom (FeN5) moiety dispersed (FeSAC&#8208;CMK) is developed as a conductive catalytic bromine host, which not only enhances the physicochemical adsorption of bromine species but also acts as a bifunctional electrocatalytic reactor to speed up redox kinetics of bromide/bromine (Br&#8722;/Br0) and free&#8208;up1/3 unserviceable Br&#8722; locked by tribromide (Br3&#8722;) via conversing Br3&#8722;/Br&#8722; redox reaction to Br0/Br&#8722; redox reaction for high energy storage.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;bromine (Zn||Br2) batteries are regarded as one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high safety, theoretical energy density, and low cost. However, the sluggish bromine redox kinetics and the formation of a soluble tribromide (Br3&#8722;) hinder their practical applications. Here, it is proposed dispersed single iron atom coordinated with nitrogen atoms (FeN5) in a mesoporous carbon framework (FeSAC&#8208;CMK) as a conductive catalytic bromine host, which possesses porous structure and electrocatalytic functionality of FeN5 species for enhanced confinement and electrocatalytic effect. The active FeN5 species can fix the bromine (Br0) species to suppress the formation of Br3&#8722; effectively and bifunctionally catalyze the bromide (Br&#8722;)/Br&#176; conversion. These free up 1/3 Br&#8722; locked by Br3&#8722; complexing agent for enhanced bromine utilization efficiency and conversion reversibility. Accordingly, the Zn||Br2 battery with FeSAC&#8208;CMK delivers an impressive specific capacity of 344 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and superior rate capability with 164 mAh g&#8722;1 achieved even at 20 A g&#8722;1, much higher than that of inactive CMK (262 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1; 6 mAh g&#8722;1 at only 8 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the battery demonstrates excellent cycling performance of 88% capacity retention after 2000 cycles.

Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved.

Abstract
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&#8722;2, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&#8722;2. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color&#8208;changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision&#8208;based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.

         <title>Polypyridiniums with Inherent Autophagy&#8208;Inducing Activity for Atherosclerosis Treatment by Intracellularly Co&#8208;Delivering Two Antioxidant Enzymes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polypyridiniums are proposed to effectively deliver two antioxidant enzymes into cytosolic of treated cells to down&#8208;regulate lipopolysaccharide induced ROS.

Abstract
Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial intima and is becoming the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is considerable evidence that defective autophagy and overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are closely involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Here, a polymer is developed with the inherent autophagy&#8208;inducing activity to treat atherosclerosis by co&#8208;delivering antioxidant enzymes. The lead material P5c screened from a library of polypyridiniums shows robust efficacy in cytosolic protein delivery, and efficiently delivers superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) into macrophages to down&#8208;regulate intracellular ROS. Moreover, P5c activates autophagy in macrophages and sufficiently inhibits foam cell formation. The P5c nanoparticle loaded with both SOD and CAT is further coated with neutrophil membranes to treat atherosclerosis in an ApoE&#8722;/&#8722; mice model. The treatment exhibits potent anti&#8208;atherosclerosis effect via activating autophagy, decreasing the infiltration of senescent cells in atherosclerotic plaques, regulating the M2 polarization of macrophages, and restoring the structure and function of splenic corpuscles. The polymer offers a multifaceted approach to combat atherosclerosis, addressing both cellular dysfunction and the need for targeted protein delivery within affected cells.

         <title>Low&#8208;Symmetry Van der Waals Dielectric GaInS3 Triggered 2D MoS2 Giant Anisotropy via Symmetry Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;symmetry dielectrics GaInS3 sparks MoS2 obvious anisotropy, at the inface of MoS2/GaInS3 heterojunction. The anisotropic optical responses are confirmed through polarized Raman and PL spectra. Under dual&#8208;gate modulation, MoS2 FET demonstrates highly adjustable anisotropic conductivity up to 106. Remarkably, the GaInS3&#8208;gated MoS2 photodetector exhibits a large dichroic ratio (&#8776;167), which greatly promotes its application in polarized photodetection.








Abstract
Low&#8208;symmetry structures in van der Waals materials have facilitated the advancement of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, the intrinsic low symmetry structure exhibits a small adjustable anisotropy ratio (1&#8211;10), which hinders its further assembly and processing into high&#8208;performance devices. Here, a novel 2D anisotropic dielectric, GaInS3 (GIS), which induces isotropic MoS2 to exhibit significant anisotropic optical and electrical responses is demonstrated. With the excellent gate modulation ability of 2D GIS (dielectric constant k &#8764;12), MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows an adjustable conductance ratio from isotropic to anisotropic under dual&#8208;gate modulation, up to 106. Theoretical calculations indicate that anisotropy originates from lattice mismatch&#8208;induced charge density deformation at the interface. Moreover, the MoS2/GIS photodetector demonstrates high responsivity (&#8776;4750 A W&#8722;1) and a large dichroic ratio (&#8776;167). The anisotropic van der Waals dielectric GIS paves the way for the development of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) in the fields of anisotropic photonics, electronics, and optoelectronics.

         <title>Innovative In Situ Passivation Strategy for High&#8208;Efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
10.81%&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell is achieved using an in situ passivation technique, which involves incorporating sodium selenosulfate to the precursor solution, effectively passivates deep&#8208;level intrinsic defects, enhances film quality, and reduces non&#8208;radiative recombination.








Abstract
An effective defect passivation strategy is crucial for enhancing the performance of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) solar cells, as it significantly influences charge transport and extraction efficiency. Herein, a convenient and novel in situ passivation (ISP) technique is successfully introduced to enhance the performance of Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells, achieving a champion efficiency of 10.81%, which is among the highest recorded for Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells to date. The first principles calculations and the experimental data reveal that incorporating sodium selenosulfate in the ISP strategy effectively functions as an in situ selenization, effectively passivating deep&#8208;level cation antisite SbSe defect within the Sb2(S,Se)3 films and significantly suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination in the devices. Space&#8208;charge&#8208;limited current (SCLC), photoluminescence (PL), and transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements verify the high quality of the passivated films, showing fewer traps and defects. Moreover, the ISP strategy improved the overall quality of the Sb2(S,Se)3 films, and fine&#8208;tuned the energy levels, thereby facilitating enhanced carrier transport. This study thus provides a straightforward and effective method for passivating deep&#8208;level defects in Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells.

         <title>Controlling the Relaxation Dynamics of Polymer Networks by Combining Associative and Dissociative Dynamic Covalent Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The network topology and spatial structure of dynamic covalent polymer networks can be designed independently from their temporal structure and dynamic nature by the judicious combination of two distinctly different dynamic covalent chemistries. This enables improved extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing, healing without creep and shape memory at time scales where the dissociative chemistry is activated and the associative chemistry remains inactive.








Abstract
Dynamic polymer networks offer a promising solution to key challenges in polymers such as recyclability, processability, and damage repair. However, the trade&#8208;off between combining facile processability, fast self&#8208;healing, and high creep resistance remains a major obstacle to implementation. To overcome this, two very distinct dynamic covalent chemistries, Diels&#8211;Alder and transesterification, is combined in a single network. The resulting dual dynamic networks offer an unprecedented set of properties and control over the relaxation times. The system decouples the relaxation dynamics of the network from the spatial motifs, and the tuning of the ratio between chemistries enables to control of the relaxation dynamics over six orders of magnitude. Taking advantage of this control, the composition and rheological behavior is optimized to drastically improve the resolution for extrusion&#8208;based additive manufacturing of dynamic covalent networks. Additionally, two well&#8208;defined and separated stress relaxation peaks are observed at compositions close to 50% of each dynamic chemistry, accentuating the double character of the system's relaxation dynamics. This atypical situation, enables to preparation of self&#8208;healing materials with negligible creep, and with shape&#8208;memory properties solely leveraging the two distinct relaxation dynamics, instead of the glass transition temperature or the melting point.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Coordination Ligand for Multifunctional Sol&#8211;Gel Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to endow sol&#8211;gel oxide films with difficult&#8208;to&#8208;realize useful functionalities, such as direct photolithography, high dielectric strength, and high mobility by replacing the native ligand of sol&#8211;gel oxide with strategically designed/synthesized functional ligands is presented. This demonstrated a high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed all&#8208;oxide patterning approach by controlling the functional ligands, facilitating a large&#8208;area oxide TFT array with high reliability.








Abstract
Here a ligand exchange strategy for synthesizing sol&#8211;gel oxides is demonstrated to achieve multifunctionality including direct photolithography, high dielectric strength, and high charge carrier mobility, which is challenging to obtain in such oxides. For this purpose, a series of bidentate ligands with azide termini and ethylene&#8208;glycol bridges is synthesized, and these ligands are universally applicable to the synthesis of a variety of dielectric and semiconductor oxides. Optimized photolithography conditions yield a high&#8208;quality ZrO2 dielectric film with a high dielectric constant and strength of &#8776;18 and &#8776;7 MV cm&#8722;1, respectively. Additionally, this strategy is applied to semiconductor oxides such as In2O3 and ZnO, and the all&#8208;oxide&#8208;patterned solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film transistor (TFT) demonstrates a high charge carrier mobility of &#8776;40 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. An oxide TFT array is fully photopatterned on a 4&#8208;inch Si wafer; uniform performances are observed across these devices. This study suggests the possibility of realizing multifunctional oxides for application in advanced electronics using simple ligand exchange chemistry.

         <title>Elastocaloric Heat Pump by Twist Induced Periodical Non&#8208;Linear Stress for Low Hysteresis and High Carnot Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fiber twisting induces periodic non&#8208;linear stress, leading to high elastocaloric performance and material COP. A novel elastocaloric heat pump is designed using this technique, incorporating a three&#8208;port valve and a pump to separate the cooling and heating media, which results in low hysteresis, high efficiency, enhanced durability, and excellent cooling.









Abstract
Elastocaloric cooling is one of the most promising solid&#8208;state cooling approaches to address the issues of energy shortage and global warming. However, the cooling efficiency and cycle life of this technology need to be improved, and the required driving force shall be reduced. Here, a novel elastocaloric heat pump by periodic non&#8208;linear stress is developed by employing fiber twisting and separated cooling and heating media. The non&#8208;linear stress generated by fiber twisting yields a hierarchical, rigid&#8208;yet&#8208;flexible architecture and a periodic entropy spatial distribution, which result in a low mechanical hysteresis work and a high cooling efficiency (a maximum material coefficient of performance (COP) of 30.8 and a maximum Carnot efficiency of 82%). The torsional non&#8208;linear stress inhibits crack propagation and results in a highly extended cycle life (14752 cycles, more than ten times of fiber stretching). The heat pump exhibits a maximum average temperature span of 25.6 K, a maximum specific cooling power of 1850&#160;W Kg&#8722;1, a maximum device COP of 19.5, and a maximum device power of 5.0&#160;W, under each optimal condition.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Micro&#8208;Nanostructured Electron Transport Layer via Bubble&#8208;Assisted Assembly for Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unbalanced diffusion lengths of photogenerated electrons and holes in formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite materials facilitate the charge recombination. Here, ordered SnO2 micro&#8208;nanoarrays are constructed by a bubble&#8208;assisted printing method and serve as &#8220;speedway&#8221; for electron transport in perovskite photovoltaics. Perovskite layers embedded with SnO2 arrays result in reduced charge recombination and improved power conversion efficiency in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention in photovoltaic research, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and cost&#8208;effective manufacturing techniques. However, the unbalanced charge carrier diffusion length in perovskite materials leads to the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The inefficient charge carrier collecting process severely affects the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs. Herein, a solution&#8208;processed SnO2 array electron transport layer with precisely tunable micro&#8208;nanostructures is fabricated via a bubble&#8208;template&#8208;assisted approach, serving as both electron transport layers and scaffolds for the perovskite layer. Due to the optimized electron transporting pathway and enlarged perovskite grain size, the PSCs achieve a PCE of 25.35% (25.07% certificated PCE).

         <title>Customization of 2D Atomic&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction with Manipulatable Charge&#8208;Transfer and Band Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined atomic&#8208;molecular heterojunction strategy is developed featuring strong covalent bonds between organic molecule and 2D violet phosphorus atomic crystal, enabling enhanced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics and customizable band structure regulation at the molecular level. Our research provides a low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;efficiency regulatory approach to optimize device performance across diverse application domains.








Abstract
Manipulating the properties of 2D&#160;materials through meticulously engineered artificial heterojunctions holds great promise for novel device applications. However, existing research on the crucial charge&#8208;transfer interactions and energy profile regulation is predominantly focused on 2D van der Waals structures formed via weak van der Waals forces, limiting regulatory efficiency at high costs. Herein, a refined atomic&#8208;molecular heterojunction strategy featuring strong covalent bonds between organic molecule and 2D violet phosphorus (VP) atomic crystal is developed, which enables enhanced charge&#8208;transfer dynamics and customizable band structure regulation at the molecular level. Both experimentally and theoretically, it is demonstrated that grafting efficiency, charge redistribution, and energy gap regulation critically depend on organic electronegativity, providing a low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;efficiency regulatory effect on a large scale. As a proof of concept, the novel VP&#8208;molecular heterojunctions exhibit optimized performance in diverse application domains, presenting a general platform for future high&#8208;performance device applications.

         <title>Upcycling the Spent Graphite Anode Into the Prelithiation Catalyst: A Separator Strategy Toward Anode&#8208;Free Cell Prototyping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Value&#8208;added recycling of spent anode has become an urgent need for the circular battery manufacturing. In this work, Yao et&#160;al. developed an &#8220;integrated closed&#8208;loop route&#8221; to upgrade the spent graphite into the prelithiation catalyst upon the fine tuning of the interlayer spacing and defect concentration, enabling customized prelithiation for the Li&#8208;deficient electrodes. It fulfills both the sustainable supply chain and battery prototyping with higher energy efficiency.








Abstract
The substantial manufacturing of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) requires sustainable, circular, and decarbonized recycling strategies. While efforts are concentrated on extracting valuable metals from cathodes using intricate chemical process, the direct, efficient cathode regeneration remains a technological challenge. More urgently, the battery supply chain also requires the value&#8208;added exploitation of retired anodes. Here, a &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; approach is proposed to upcycle spent graphite into the prelithiation catalyst, namely the fewer&#8208;layer graphene flakes (FGF), upon the exquisite tuning of interlayer spacing and defect concentration. Since the catalytic FGF mitigates the delithiation energy barrier from calcinated Li5FeO4 nanocrystalline, the composite layer of which cast on the polyolefin substrate thus enables a customized prelithiation capability (98% Li+ utilization) for the retired LiFePO4 recovery. Furthermore, the hydrophobic polymeric modification guarantees the moisture tolerance of Li5FeO4 agents, aligning with commercial battery manufacturing standards. The separator strategy well regulates the interfacial chemistry in the anode&#8208;free pouch cell (LiFePO4||Cu), the prototype of which balances the robust cyclability, energy density up to 386.6&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 as well as the extreme power output of 1159.8&#160;W kg&#8722;1. This study not only fulfills the sustainable supply chain with graphite upcycling, but also establishes a generic, viable protocol for the anode&#8208;free cell prototyping.

         <title>De&#8208;Passivation and Surface Crystal Plane Reconstruction via Chemical Polishing for Highly Reversible Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemically polished Zn metal anode (CP&#8208;Zn), achieved through a facile immersion method, effectively removes passivation layers and selectively exposes (002) crystal planes. This process ensures uniform zinc deposition and improved cell stability, demonstrated by over 4600 hours of stable cycling in symmetric cells and high capacity retention in full cells.








Abstract
Despite the widespread adoption of Zn anodes for aqueous energy storage, the presence of an inherent passivation layer and the polycrystalline interface of commercial Zn foil consistently lead to non&#8208;uniform electrodeposition, undermining stability and practicality. Herein, the study introduces a chemically polished Zn metal anode (CP&#8208;Zn) fabricated via a simple immersion method. This &#8220;chemically polishing&#8221; process can effectively remove the interfacial passivation layer (de&#8208;passivation), providing ample active sites for plating/stripping and ensuring the uniformly distributed electric field and Zn2+ ion flux. Additionally, selective etching during chemical polishing exposes more (002) crystal planes, promoting homogeneous and smooth zinc deposition while suppressing related side reactions. Demonstrated by CP&#8208;Zn anode, the symmetric cell exhibits stable cycling over 4600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 240&#160;h at 50% depth of discharge (DOD), with a CP&#8208;Zn||VO2 full cell maintaining &#8776;75.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 A g&#8722;1. This chemically polishing strategy presents a promising avenue for advancing the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

Additionally, selective etching during chemical polishing exposes more (002) crystal planes, promoting homogeneous and smooth zinc deposition while suppressing related side reactions. Demonstrated by CP-Zn anode, the symmetric cell exhibits stable cycling over 4600&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 240&#160;h at 50% depth of discharge (DOD), with a CP-Zn||VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; full cell maintaining &#8776;75.3% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 3 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This chemically polishing strategy presents a promising avenue for advancing the commercialization of aqueous zinc-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aided Porous Medium Emulsification for Functional Hydrogel Microparticles Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aided porous medium emulsification for hydrogel microparticle synthesis (APME&#8208;HMS) system introduces a new approach to the hydrogel microparticle synthesis arsenal utilizing emulsification in a 3D porous medium. This innovative method synthesizes various&#8208;sized, functional microgels in minutes. With a scalable, cost&#8208;effective technique, APME&#8208;HMS has vast potential in biomedicine and beyond, with promising advancements in drug delivery, biosensing, and culinary arts.








Abstract
Despite the substantial advancement in developing various hydrogel microparticle (HMP) synthesis methods, emulsification through porous medium to synthesize functional hybrid protein&#8211;polymer HMPs has yet to be addressed. Here, the aided porous medium emulsification for hydrogel microparticle synthesis (APME&#8208;HMS) system, an innovative approach drawing inspiration from porous medium emulsification is introduced. This method capitalizes on emulsifying immiscible phases within a 3D porous structure for optimal HMP production. Using the APME&#8208;HMS system, synthesized responsive bovine serum albumin (BSA) and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) HMPs of various sizes are successfully synthesized. Preserving protein structural integrity and functionality enable the formation of cytochrome c (cyt c) &#8211; PEGDA HMPs for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) detection at various concentrations. The flexibility of the APME&#8208;HMS system is demonstrated by its ability to efficiently synthesize HMPs using low volumes (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;L) and concentrations (100&#160;&#181;m) of proteins within minutes while preserving proteins&#8217; structural and functional properties. Additionally, the capability of the APME&#8208;HMS method to produce a diverse array of HMP types enriches the palette of HMP fabrication techniques, presenting it as a cost&#8208;effective, biocompatible, and scalable alternative for various biomedical applications, such as controlled drug delivery, 3D printing bio&#8208;inks, biosensing devices, with potential implications even in culinary applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Metaphotonic PCR Chip with Near&#8208;Perfect Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metasurface&#8208;based, efficient, and low&#8208;cost photonic PCR device using a titanium nitride&#8208;based broadband meta&#8208;absorber is proposed by providing rapid heating and cooling, resulting in ultrafast DNA amplification within 6&#160;min 30 s using a compact single infrared LED. The meta&#8208;absorber is fabricated using cost&#8208;effective colloidal lithography on a 6&#8208;inch Si wafer, enabling mass production for applying photonic PCR for POC diagnosis.








Abstract
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the gold standard for nucleic acid amplification and quantification in diverse fields such as life sciences, global health, medicine, agricultural science, forensic science, and environmental science for global sustainability. However, implementing a cost&#8208;effective PCR remains challenging for rapid preventive medical action to the widespread pandemic diseases due to the absence of highly efficient and low&#8208;cost PCR chip&#8208;based POC molecular diagnostics. Here, this work reports an ultrafast metaphotonic PCR chip as a solution of a cost&#8208;effective and low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption POC device for the emerging global challenge of sustainable healthcare. This work designs a near&#8208;perfect photonic meta&#8208;absorber using ring&#8208;shaped titanium nitride to maximize the photothermal effect and realize rapid heating and cooling cycles during the PCR process. This work fabricates a large&#8208;area photonic meta&#8208;absorber on a 6&#8208;inch wafer cost&#8208;effectively using simple colloidal lithography. In addition, this work demonstrates 30 thermocycles from 65 (annealing temperature) to 95&#160;&#176;C (denaturation temperature) within 3&#160;min 15&#160;s, achieving an average 16.66&#160;&#176;C&#160;s&#8722;1 heating rate and 7.77&#160;&#176;C&#160;s&#8722;1 cooling rate during thermocycling, succeeding rapid metaphotonic PCR. This work believes a metaphotonic PCR chip can be used to create a low&#8208;cost, ultrafast molecular diagnostic chip with a meta&#8208;absorber.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Passivated Monolayer WSe2 Nanoribbon Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents edge passivation for p&#8208;type monolayer WSe2 nanoribbon transistors using nanolithography and a controlled remote O2 plasma process. The edge passivation material consists of amorphous WOxSey. Compared to microribbons, nanoribbons with passivated edges exhibit reduced defect density and increased p&#8208;doping, whereas nanoribbons with open edges exhibit higher defect densities and reduced p&#8208;doping.








Abstract
The ongoing reduction in transistor sizes drives advancements in information technology. However, as transistors shrink to the nanometer scale, surface and edge states begin to constrain their performance. 2D&#160;semiconductors&#160;like&#160;transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160;have dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces, hence achieving minimal surface states. Nonetheless, edge state disorder still limits the performance of width&#8208;scaled 2D transistors. This work demonstrates a facile edge passivation method to enhance the electrical properties of monolayer WSe2 nanoribbons, by combining scanning transmission electron microscopy, optical spectroscopy, and field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) transport measurements. Monolayer WSe2 nanoribbons are passivated with amorphous WOxSey at the edges, which is achieved&#160;using nanolithography and a controlled remote O2 plasma process. The same nanoribbons, with and without edge passivation are sequentially fabricated and measured. The passivated&#8208;edge nanoribbon FETs exhibit 10 &#177; 6 times higher field&#8208;effect mobility than the open&#8208;edge nanoribbon FETs, which are characterized with dangling bonds at the edges. WOxSey edge passivation minimizes edge disorder and enhances the material quality of WSe2 nanoribbons. Owing to its simplicity and effectiveness, oxidation&#8208;based edge passivation could become a turnkey manufacturing solution for TMD nanoribbons in beyond&#8208;silicon electronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Harnessing Nanochaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy for Selective Clearance of Pathogenic Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research demonstrates a nanochaperone&#8208;mediated&#8208;autophagy&#8208;based strategy that can specifically recognize pathogenic tau and recruit them, thereby maintaining the tau homeostasis to guarantee microtubule stability. Meanwhile, the captured pathogenic tau can be sequestered by in situ autophagy activation and transported along the stabilized microtubule to achieve successful fusion with lysosomes, resulting in selective clearance of pathogenic tau protein in Alzheimer's disease.








Abstract
Accumulation of pathological tau is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which correlates more closely with cognitive impairment than does the amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) burden. Autophagy is a powerful process for the clearance of toxic proteins including aberrant tau. However, compromised autophagy is demonstrated in neurodegeneration including AD, and current autophagy inducers remain enormously challenging due to inability of restoring autophagy pathway and lack of targeting specificity. Here, pathogenic tau&#8208;specific autophagy based on customized nanochaperone is developed for AD treatment. In this strategy, the nanochaperone can selectively bind to pathogenic tau and maintain tau homeostasis, thereby ensuring microtubule stability which is important for autophagy pathway. Meanwhile, the bound pathogenic tau can be sequestered in autophagosomes by in situ autophagy activation of nanochaperone. Consequently, autophagosomes wrapping with pathogenic tau are able to be trafficked along the stabilized microtubule to achieve successful fusion with lysosomes, resulting in the enhancement of autophagic flux and pathologic tau clearance. After treatment with this nanochaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy strategy, the tau burden, neuron damages, and cognitive deficits of AD mice are significantly alleviated in the brain. Therefore, this work represents a promising candidate for AD&#8208;targeted therapy and provides new insights into future design of anti&#8208;neurodegeneration drugs.

         <title>Composition Modulation&#8208;Mediated Band Alignment Engineering from Type I to Type III in 2D vdW Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The band alignment of 1L&#8208;WSe2/5L&#8208;Bi2Te3&#8208;xSex vdWHs can be continuously modulated from Type I (x = 0) to Type III (x = 3) by increasing Se mole fraction, which is crucial for promoting charge separation and transfer in optoelectronic devices, ultimately determining the behavior of photodetectors and LEDs based on vdWHs.








Abstract
Band alignment engineering is crucial for facilitating charge separation and transfer in optoelectronic devices, which ultimately dictates the behavior of Van der Waals heterostructures (vdWH)&#8208;based photodetectors and light emitting diode (LEDs). However, the impact of the band offset in vdWHs on important figures of merit in optoelectronic devices has not yet been systematically analyzed. Herein, the regulation of band alignment in WSe2/Bi2Te3&#8208;xSex vdWHs (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 3) is demonstrated through the implementation of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). A combination of experimental and theoretical results proved that the synthesized vdWHs can be gradually tuned from Type I (WSe2/Bi2Te3) to Type III (WSe2/Bi2Se3). As the band alignment changes from Type I to Type III, a remarkable responsivity of 58.12 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 2.91&#215;1012 Jones (in Type I) decrease in the vdWHs&#8208;based photodetector, and the ultrafast photoresponse time is 3.2 &#181;s (in Type III). Additionally, Type III vdWH&#8208;based LEDs exhibit the highest luminance and electroluminescence (EL) external quantum efficiencies (EQE) among p&#8208;n diodes based on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDs) at room temperature, which is attributed to band alignment&#8208;induced distinct interfacial charge injection. This work serves as a valuable reference for the application and expansion of fundamental band alignment principles in the design and fabrication of future optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Reversible Solar Heating and Radiative Cooling Devices via Mechanically Guided Assembly of 3D Macro/Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices employing mechanically guided 3D architectures demonstrate dual&#8208;mode actuation with uniaxial strain. These devices, which are applicable on macro/microscales, utilize optimized 3D platforms that accommodate both rigid and soft materials. Heating/cooling layers achieve heating/cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The fabricated devices exhibit effective heating/cooling on diverse surfaces.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling are promising solutions for decreasing global energy consumption because these strategies use the Sun (&#8776;5800&#160;K) as a heating source and outer space (&#8776;3&#160;K) as a cooling source. Although high&#8208;performance thermal management can be achieved using these eco&#8208;friendly methods, they are limited by daily temperature fluctuations and seasonal changes because of single&#8208;mode actuation. Herein, reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices formed via the mechanically guided assembly of 3D architectures are demonstrated. The fabricated devices exhibit the following properties: i) The devices reversibly change between solar heating and radiative cooling under uniaxial strain, called dual&#8208;mode actuation. ii) The 3D platforms in the devices can use rigid/soft materials for functional layers owing to the optimized designs. iii) The devices can be used for dual&#8208;mode thermal management on a macro/microscale. The devices use black paint&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) films as solar absorbers with multilayered films comprising thin layers of polydimethylsiloxane/silver/PI, achieving heating and cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Moreover, mode changes according to the angle of the 3D structures are demonstrated and the heating/cooling performance with skin, glass, steel, aluminum, copper, and PI substrates is investigated.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforced MOF&#8208;Based Nanogel Alleviates Osteoarthritis by Long&#8208;Acting Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanogel, KZIF@HA, formed through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions between surface&#8208;modified Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) and hyaluronic acid is developed. The nanogel exhibits sustained drug release for one month with minimal leakage risk. ZIF&#8208;8's acid&#8208;degrading properties promote extracellular matrix secretion and M2 macrophage polarization, reversing osteoarthritis progression. Transcriptome sequencing and in vivo experiments confirm KZIF@HA's potential for osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
Intra&#8208;articular injection of drugs is an effective strategy for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. However, the complex microenvironment and limited joint space result in rapid clearance of drugs. Herein, a nanogel&#8208;based strategy is proposed for prolonged drug delivery and microenvironment remodeling. Nanogel is constructed through the functionalization of hyaluronic acid (HA) by amide reaction on the surface of Kartogenin (KGN)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (denoted as KZIF@HA). Leveraging the inherent hydrophilicity of HA, KZIF@HA spontaneously forms nanogels, ensuring extended drug release in the OA microenvironment. KZIF@HA exhibits sustained drug release over one month, with low leakage risk from the joint cavity compared to KZIF, enhanced cartilage penetration, and reparative effects on chondrocytes. Notably, KGN released from KZIF@HA serves to promote extracellular matrix (ECM) secretion for hyaline cartilage regeneration. Zn2+ release reverses OA progression by promoting M2 macrophage polarization to establish an anti&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment. Ultimately, KZIF@HA facilitates cartilage regeneration and OA alleviation within three months. Transcriptome sequencing validates that KZIF@HA stimulates the polarization of M2 macrophages and secretes IL&#8208;10 to inhibit the JNK and ERK pathways, promoting chondrocytes recovery and enhancing ECM remodeling. This pioneering nanogel system offers new therapeutic opportunities for sustained drug release, presenting a significant stride in OA treatment strategies.

         <title>Carbonated Beverage Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transformative approach using Cola&#8208;like supersaturated CO2 for interface upgrading is proposed to stabilize 4.8&#160;V polycrystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathodes, and it is also generalized to high&#8208;voltage single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2. 4.8 V NCM811 delivers an ultra&#8208;high capacity over 235&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and cathode energy over 900 W h kg&#8722;1 and retains &#8776;90% capacity over 100 cycles.








Abstract
Advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries utilize high upper cut&#8208;off voltages up to 4.8&#160;V versus lithium metal to reach extraordinary energy densities. Such a harsh environment challenges the cathode stability and requires the construction of robust cathode electrolyte interphases at their electrochemical interface. Inspired by carbonated beverages with supersaturated CO2, here, a surface modification strategy that produces effective passivation layer of low modulus from the weakest link, is proposed CO2 bubbles preferentially nucleate and grow at rough surfaces, which in oxide cathodes, are also the local regions offering fast degradation pathway. Metal ion exchange on carbonated layer assists the construction of highly elastic interface under the guidance of packing factor. This method enables surface reconstruction at both primary and secondary particle levels for various cathodes exemplified by high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) and LiCoO2 (LCO). Remarkably, with ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8&#160;V versus Li+/Li, over 235 mAh g&#8722;1 discharge capacity, and over 900&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 discharge energy at cathode level, &#8776;90% capacity retention can be obtained for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 over 100 cycles at 0.5 C with commercial carbonate electrolytes. This carbonated beverage chemistry is promising for constructing high&#8208;quality surface passivation in many extreme&#8208;condition applications beyond battery cathodes.

Inspired by carbonated beverages with supersaturated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, here, a surface modification strategy that produces effective passivation layer of low modulus from the weakest link, is proposed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubbles preferentially nucleate and grow at rough surfaces, which in oxide cathodes, are also the local regions offering fast degradation pathway. Metal ion exchange on carbonated layer assists the construction of highly elastic interface under the guidance of packing factor. This method enables surface reconstruction at both primary and secondary particle levels for various cathodes exemplified by high-voltage LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811) and LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO). Remarkably, with ultra-high upper cut-off voltage of 4.8&#160;V versus Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Li, over 235 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; discharge capacity, and over 900&#160;W h kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; discharge energy at cathode level, &#8776;90% capacity retention can be obtained for LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over 100 cycles at 0.5 C with commercial carbonate electrolytes. This carbonated beverage chemistry is promising for constructing high-quality surface passivation in many extreme-condition applications beyond battery cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Visualization of Defect&#8208;Controlled Diffusion in van der Waals Gaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
W atom diffusion at van der Waals (vdW) interfaces (BN/WSe2, BN/BN), and on BN surfaces using scanning transmission electron microscopy is visualized. Diffusion is in all cases is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam&#8208;generated defect sites, suggesting processes that are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. This enables direct visualization of atomic interactions and materials inside vdW heterostructures.








Abstract
Diffusion processes govern fundamental phenomena such as phase transformations, doping, and intercalation in van der Waals (vdW) bonded materials. Here, the diffusion dynamics of W atoms by visualizing the motion of individual atoms at three different vdW interfaces: hexagonal boron nitride (BN)/vacuum, BN/BN, and BN/WSe2, by recording scanning transmission electron microscopy movies is quantified. Supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it is inferred that in all cases diffusion is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam&#8208;generated defect sites. This leads to diffusion properties that depend strongly on the number of defects. These results suggest that diffusion and intercalation processes in vdW materials are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. The demonstration of imaging, with high spatial and temporal resolution, of layers and individual atoms inside vdW heterostructures offers possibilities for direct visualization of diffusion and atomic interactions, as well as for experiments exploring atomic structures, their in situ modification, and electrical property measurements of active devices combined with atomic resolution&#160;imaging.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Semiconducting Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion&#8208;exchange doping of semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with small and large bandgaps using AuCl3 as the p&#8208;dopant with a range of electrolyte anions of different sizes is demonstrated. Larger anion size correlates with higher electrical conductivity, which is explained with the reduced depth of the impurity band formed at high doping densities.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are a promising thermoelectric material with high power factors after chemical p&#8208; or n&#8208;doping. Understanding the impact of dopant counterions on charge transport and thermoelectric properties of nanotube networks is essential to further optimize doping methods and to develop better dopants. This work utilizes ion&#8208;exchange doping to systematically vary the size of counterions in thin films of small and large diameter, polymer&#8208;sorted semiconducting SWCNTs with AuCl3 as the initial p&#8208;dopant and investigates the impact of ion size on conductivity, Seebeck coefficients, and power factors. Larger anions are found to correlate with higher electrical conductivities and improved doping stability, while no significant effect on the power factors is found. Importantly, the effect of counterion size on the thermoelectric properties of dense SWCNT networks is not obscured by morphological changes upon doping. The observed trends of carrier mobilities and Seebeck coefficients can be explained by a random resistor model for the nanotube network that accounts for overlapping Coulomb potentials leading to the formation of an impurity band whose depth depends on the carrier density and counterion size. These insights can be applied more broadly to understand the thermoelectric properties of doped percolating disordered systems, including semiconducting polymers.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks into Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D metal&#8211;organic framework crystals can be exfoliated into 2D nanosheets via simple sonication&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation. The ease of exfoliation for a given 3D crystal can be quantified by the facilely available mechanical anisotropy index, Emax/Emin (Emax and Emin denote the maximum and minimum elastic modulus, respectively).








Abstract
Traditionally, the acquisition of 2D materials involved the exfoliation of layered crystals. However, the anisotropic bonding arrangements within 3D crystals indicate they are mechanically reminiscent of 2D counterparts and could also be exfoliated into nanosheets. This report delineates the preparation of 2D nanosheets from six representative 3D metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) through liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation. Notably, the cleavage planes of exfoliated nanosheets align perpendicular to the direction of the minimum elastic modulus (Emin) within the pristine 3D frameworks. The findings suggest that the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bonding forces of the exfoliated nanosheets can be correlated with the maximum elastic modulus (Emax) and Emin of the 3D frameworks, respectively. Emax influences the ease of cleaving adjacent layers, while Emin governs the ability to resist cracking of layers. Hence, a combination of large Emax and small Emin indicates an efficient exfoliation process, and vice versa. The ratio of Emax/Emin, denoted as Amax/min, is adopted as a universal index to quantify the ease of mechanical exfoliation for 3D MOFs. This ratio, readily accessible through mechanical experiments and computation, serves as a valuable metric for selecting appropriate exfoliation methods to produce surfactant&#8208;free 2D nanosheets from various 3D materials.

         <title>Potential Water Collection From Air by Chloride Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores metal chloride perovskites as a novel class of sorbent materials for atmospheric water harvesting. These materials effectively adsorb water vapor through delicate bonds with water molecules and reversible reactions involving hydrate intermediates. This design locks hygroscopic A&#8208;site ions within a stable [PbCl3] sublattice, forming perovskite crystals, making them promising candidates for atmospheric water harvesting applications.








Abstract
Directly capturing water from the air has become a compelling strategy to secure water resources. Yet, challenges persist with sorption&#8208;based hygroscopic materials, such as inadequate water adsorption efficiency, material degradation post&#8208;adsorption, and the need for energy input during water collection. This study introduces an alternative category of sorbent materials potentially for atmospheric water harvesting&#8212;metal chloride perovskites&#8212;that exhibit spontaneous water vapor adsorption and liquid water collection. This water uptake capability stems from the uncoordinated polar ions that form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, while the cubic lattice imparts a solid framework ensuring structural stability and inhibiting hydrolysis. The methylammonium lead chloride perovskite pellets exhibit efficient water collection performance, with a record absorption rate of 0.841 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and a total water collection of 3.675 L m&#8722;2 within a 7&#8208;h cycle. This initiative attempts to provide a new material class candidate for the potential application of passive atmospheric water harvesting.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Through Decoupling of Colloidal Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The utilization of &#8242;QD&#8208;in&#8208;organic solid solution&#8217; as an emissive layer in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes achieves deep&#8208;blue emission by mitigating particle interactions that typically lead to a spectral redshift in the film. This approach results in a &#8776;7 nm blueshifted emission, with a deep&#8208;blue color coordinate of CIEy &lt; 0.06, along with a notable external quantum efficiency of 6.2%.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have exceptional color purity but designs that emit deep&#8208;blue color with high efficiency have not been fully achieved and become more difficult in the thin film of confined perovskite colloidal quantum dots (PeQDs) due to particle interaction. Here it is demonstrated that electronic coupling and energy transfer in PeQDs induce redshift in the emission by PeQD film, and consequently hinder deep&#8208;blue emission. To achieve deep&#8208;blue emission by avoiding electronic coupling and energy transfer, a QD&#8208;in&#8208;organic solid solution is introduced to physically separate the QDs in the film. This physical separation of QDs reduces the interaction between them yielding a blueshift of &#8776;7&#160;nm in the emission spectrum. Moreover, using a hole&#8208;transporting organic molecule with a deep&#8208;lying highest occupied molecular orbital (&#8776;6.0&#160;eV) as the organic matrix, the formation of exciplex emission is suppressed. As a result, an unprecedently high maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.2% at 462&#160;nm from QD&#8208;in&#8208;organic solid solution film in PeLEDs is achieved, which satisfies the deep&#8208;blue color coordinates of CIEy &lt;&#160;0.06. This work suggests an important material strategy to deepen blue emission without reducing the particle size to &lt;&#8776;4&#160;nm.

         <title>Coexistence and Interplay of Two Ferroelectric Mechanisms in Zn1&#8208;xMgxO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the ferroelectric properties of Zn1&#8208;xMgxO using automated piezoresponse force microscopy, unveiling a novel &#8220;fringing&#8208;ridge mechanism&#8221; for polarization switching, marked by lateral nucleation expansion without depth propagation. This contradicts the conventional polarization switching process observed in perovskite ferroelectrics. This discovery enhances the understanding of polarization dynamics and their potential applications in information technology.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials promise exceptional attributes including low power dissipation, fast operational speeds, enhanced endurance, and superior retention to revolutionize information technology. However, the practical application of ferroelectric&#8208;semiconductor memory devices has been significantly challenged by the incompatibility of traditional perovskite oxide ferroelectrics with metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology. Recent discoveries of ferroelectricity in binary oxides such as Zn1&#8208;xMgxO and Hf1&#8208;xZrxO have been a focal point of research in ferroelectric information technology. This work investigates the ferroelectric properties of Zn1&#8208;xMgxO utilizing automated band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy. This findings reveal the coexistence of two ferroelectric subsystems within Zn1&#8208;xMgxO. A &#8220;fringing&#8208;ridge mechanism&#8221; of polarization switching is proposed that is characterized by initial lateral expansion of nucleation without significant propagation in depth, contradicting the conventional domain growth process observed in ferroelectrics. This unique polarization dynamics in Zn1&#8208;xMgxO suggests a new understanding of ferroelectric behavior, contributing to both the fundamental science of ferroelectrics and their application in information technology.

         <title>Compliant DNA Origami Nanoactuators as Size&#8208;Selective Nanopores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconfigurable MechanoPore, built from DNA origami, is a nanopore with tunable lumen sizes that can be controllably activated by different molecular triggers. The MechanoPores can switch between 3 distinct states (open, intermediate, closed), after incorporation into a lipid membrane, enabling the controlled influx or exclusion of differently&#8208;sized cargo.








Abstract
Biological nanopores crucially control the import and export of biomolecules across lipid membranes in cells. They have found widespread use in biophysics and biotechnology, where their typically narrow, fixed diameters enable selective transport of ions and small molecules, as well as DNA and peptides for sequencing applications. Yet, due to their small channel sizes, they preclude the passage of large macromolecules, e.g., therapeutics. Here, the unique combined properties of DNA origami nanotechnology, machine&#8208;inspired design, and synthetic biology are harnessed, to present a structurally reconfigurable DNA origami MechanoPore (MP) that features a lumen that is tuneable in size through molecular triggers. Controllable switching of MPs between 3 stable states is confirmed by 3D&#8208;DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution imaging and through dye&#8208;influx assays, after reconstitution of the large MPs in the membrane of liposomes via an inverted&#8208;emulsion cDICE technique. Confocal imaging of transmembrane transport shows size&#8208;selective behavior with adjustable thresholds. Importantly, the conformational changes are fully reversible, attesting to the robust mechanical switching that overcomes pressure from the surrounding lipid molecules. These MPs advance nanopore technology, offering functional nanostructures that can be tuned on&#8208;demand &#8211; thereby impacting fields as diverse as drug delivery, biomolecule sorting, and sensing, as well as bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology.

         <title>Observation of Antiferroelectric Domain Walls in a Uniaxial Hyperferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emergence of antiferroelectric domain walls in ferroelectric Pb5Ge3O11 is reported. Alternating Pb displacements are resolved, resulting in antiferroelectrically coupled dipole layers. Calculations show that Pb5Ge3O11 is hyperferroelectric, allowing the system to stabilize antiparallel ordering of dipoles along the longitudinal direction. The results suggest a new type of excited domain&#8208;wall state, expanding studies on ferroelectric domain walls into the realm of antiferroic phenomena.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are a rich source of emergent electronic properties and unusual polar order. Recent studies show that the configuration of ferroelectric walls can go well beyond the conventional Ising&#8208;type structure. N&#233;el&#8208;, Bloch&#8208;, and vortex&#8208;like polar patterns have been observed, displaying strong similarities with the spin textures at magnetic domain walls. Here, the discovery of antiferroelectric domain walls in the uniaxial ferroelectric Pb5Ge3O11 is reported. Highly mobile domain walls with an alternating displacement of Pb atoms are resolved, resulting in a cyclic 180&#176; flip of dipole direction within the wall. Density functional theory calculations show that Pb5Ge3O11 is hyperferroelectric, allowing the system to overcome the depolarization fields that usually suppress the antiparallel ordering of dipoles along the longitudinal direction. Interestingly, the antiferroelectric walls observed under the electron beam are energetically more costly than basic head&#8208;to&#8208;head or tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail walls. The results suggest a new type of excited domain&#8208;wall state, expanding previous studies on ferroelectric domain walls into the realm of antiferroic phenomena.

         <title>Fusible and Radiopaque Microspheres for Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fusible and radiopaque microspheres (FRMs) are prepared for transcatheter arterial embolization. A clinical contrast agent, Lipiodol, is encapsulated in the microspheres, making them fusible in physiological environments, contributing to complete ischemic necrosis. Additionally, Lipiodol provides the microspheres with a sustained X&#8208;ray imaging feature, allowing for the monitoring of their location in vivo.








Abstract
In this work, fusible microspheres loaded with radiopaque agents as an embolic agent for transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) are developed. A poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCL) multi&#8208;block copolymer basing polyurethane (PCEU) is synthesized and fabricated into blank microspheres (BMs). The microspheres are elastic in compression test. A clinical contrast agent lipiodol is encapsulated in the microspheres to receive fusible radiopaque microspheres (FRMs). The sizes of FRMs are uniform and range from 142.2 to 343.1&#160;&#181;m. The encapsulated lipiodol acts as the plasticizer to reduce the melting temperature point (Tm) of PECU microspheres, thus, leading to the fusion of microspheres to exhibit efficient embolization in vivo. The performance of FRMs is carried out on a rabbit ear embolization model. Serious ischemic necrosis is observed and the radiopacity of FRMs sustains much longer time than that of commercial contrast agent Loversol in vivo. The fusible and radiopaque microsphere is promising to be developed as an exciting embolic agent.

         <title>Accounting for the Quantum Capacitance of Graphite in Constant Potential Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The constant applied potential molecular dynamics method is modified to account for the quantum capacitance of electrode materials. The parameterization is made based on density functional theory calculations of the electronic density of states. The method is validated by computing the capacitance of graphite electrodes in contact with ionic electrolytes.








Abstract
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at a constant electric potential are an essential tool to study electrochemical processes, providing microscopic information on the structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties. Despite the numerous advances in the simulation of electrodes, they fail to accurately represent the electronic structure of materials such as graphite. In this work, a simple parameterization method that allows to tune the metallicity of the electrode based on a quantum chemistry calculation of the density of states (DOS) is introduced. As a first illustration, the interface between graphite electrodes and two different liquid electrolytes, an aqueous solution of NaCl and a pure ionic liquid, at different applied potentials are studied. It is shown that the simulations reproduce qualitatively the experimentally&#8208;measured capacitance; in particular, they yield a minimum of capacitance at the point of zero charge (PZC), which is due to the quantum capacitance (QC) contribution. An analysis of the structure of the adsorbed liquids allows to understand why the ionic liquid displays a lower capacitance despite its large ionic concentration. In addition to its relevance for the important class of carbonaceous electrodes, this method can be applied to any electrode materials (e.g. 2D materials, conducting polymers, etc), thus enabling molecular simulation studies of complex electrochemical devices in the&#160;future.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Reconfiguration of Oxyhydroxides for Photoanodes with 4.24% Efficiency and Stability Beyond 250 Hours</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting attracts significant interest in converting solar energy into clean hydrogen fuels. A light&#8208;accelerated atomic reconfiguration of NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy heterostructure based on NiFe nanofilm is engineered as a catalytic&#8208;protective layer for photoanodes, reporting a record ABPE value of 4.24% in buried homojunction&#8208;free photoanodes and stability over 250 h with above 88% retention of the initial current density.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is attracting significant research interest in addressing sustainable development goals in renewable energy. Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, however, cannot provide photoanodes with simultaneously high efficiency and long&#8208;lasting lifetime. Here, large&#8208;scale NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy hybridized co&#8208;catalyst layer that exhibits an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 4.24% in buried homojunction&#8208;free photoanodes and stability over 250 h is reported. These performances represent an increase over the present highest&#8208;performing technology by 408% in stability and the most stable competitor by over 330% in efficiency. These results originate from a previously unexplored mechanism of light&#8208;induced atomic reconfiguration, which rapidly self&#8208;generates a catalytic&#8208;protective amorphous/crystalline heterostructure at low biases. This mechanism provides active sites for reaction and insulates the photoanode from performance degradation. Photon&#8208;generated NiFe oxyhydroxides are more than 200% higher than the quantity that pure electrocatalysis would otherwise induce, overcoming the threshold for an efficient water oxidation reaction in the device. While of immediate interest in the industry of water splitting, the light&#8208;induced NiFe oxyhydroxides&#8208;alloy co&#8208;catalyst developed in this work provides a general strategy to enhance further the performances and stability of PEC devices for a vast panorama of chemical reactions, ranging from biomass valorization to organic waste degradation, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion.

         <title>Calcium Hexacyanoferrate (III) Nanocatalyst Enables Redox Homeostasis for Autism Spectrum Disorder Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity. Oxidative stress is a critical pathological feature of ASD, contributing to neuronal damage and inflammation due to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS). Herein a pioneering intervention, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), a distinct catalytic nanoenzyme designed for ASD treatment is unveiled. By mitigating oxidative stress, impeding cellular apoptosis, and fostering an anti&#8208;inflammatory environment within the neural milieu, CaH NCs play a pivotal role in alleviating autism&#8208;like behaviors in animal models of ASD.








Abstract
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a multifaced neurodevelopmental disorder with considerable heterogeneity, in which over&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce a cascade of pathological changes, including cellular apoptosis and inflammatory responses. Given the complex etiology of ASD, no effective treatment is available for ASD. In this work, a specific catalytic nanoenzyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate (III) nanocatalysts (CaH NCs), is designed and engineered for efficient ASD treatment. CaH NCs can mimic the activities of natural enzymes including superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, which mitigates intracellular excessive ROS and regulates redox equilibrium. These CaH NCs modulate mitochondrial membrane potential, elevate B&#8208;cell lymphoma&#8208;2 levels, and suppress pro&#8208;apoptotic proteins, including Caspase&#8208;3 and B&#8208;cell lymphoma&#8208;2&#8208;associated X, thus effectively reducing cellular apoptosis. Importantly, CaH NCs alleviate inflammation by upregulating anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokine interleukin&#8208;10 and downregulating pro&#8208;inflammatory factors, resulting in attenuated activation of microglial and astrocytic and subsequent reduction in neuroinflammation. Subsequently, CaH NCs enhance social abilities, decrease anxiety levels, ameliorate repetitive behaviors, and improve learning and memory in ASD animal models through inflammation regulation and apoptosis inhibition. The CaH NCs in managing and preventing ASD represents a paradigm shift in autism treatment, paving the alternative but efficient way for clinical interventions in neurological conditions.

         <title>Regulating Surface Metal Abundance via Lattice&#8208;Matched Coordination for Versatile and Environmentally&#8208;Viable Sn&#8208;Pb Alloying Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice&#8208;matched coordination of Sn&#8208;Pb alloying perovskites by cobweb&#8208;like quadrangular macrocyclic porphyrin chelators beneficially regulates the surface metal abundance for versatile construction of high&#8208;efficiency single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells with extended lifespan and minimized toxic Pb leakage.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb alloying perovskites showcased great potential in constructing multiple&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies approaching or exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. However, the uncontrollable surface metal abundance (Sn2+ and Pb2+ ions) hinders their efficiency and versatility in different device structures. Additionally, the undesired Pb distribution mainly at the buried interface accelerates the Pb leakage when devices are damaged. In this work, a novel strategy is presented to modulate crystallization kinetics and surface metal abundance of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites using a cobweb&#8208;like quadrangular macrocyclic porphyrin material, which features a molecular size compatible with the perovskite lattice and robustly coordinates with Pb2+ ions, thus immobilizing them and increasing surface Pb abundance by 61%. This modulation reduces toxic Pb leakage rates by 24&#8208;fold, with only &#8764;23 ppb Pb in water after severely damaged PSCs are immersed in water for 150 h.This strategy can also enhance chemical homogeneity, reduce trap density, release tensile strain and optimize carrier dynamics of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites and relevant devices. Encouragingly, the power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of 23.28% for single&#8208;junction, full&#8208;stack devices and 21.34% for hole transport layer&#8208;free Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs are achieved.Notably, the related monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell also achieves a PCE of 27.03% with outstanding photostability.

     alt="Regulating Surface Metal Abundance via Lattice-Matched Coordination for Versatile and Environmentally-Viable Sn-Pb Alloying Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lattice-matched coordination of Sn-Pb alloying perovskites by cobweb-like quadrangular macrocyclic porphyrin chelators beneficially regulates the surface metal abundance for versatile construction of high-efficiency single-junction and tandem solar cells with extended lifespan and minimized toxic Pb leakage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narrow-bandgap Sn-Pb alloying perovskites showcased great potential in constructing multiple-junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with efficiencies approaching or exceeding the Shockley-Queisser limit. However, the uncontrollable surface metal abundance (Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions) hinders their efficiency and versatility in different device structures. Additionally, the undesired Pb distribution mainly at the buried interface accelerates the Pb leakage when devices are damaged. In this work, a novel strategy is presented to modulate crystallization kinetics and surface metal abundance of Sn-Pb perovskites using a cobweb-like quadrangular macrocyclic porphyrin material, which features a molecular size compatible with the perovskite lattice and robustly coordinates with Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, thus immobilizing them and increasing surface Pb abundance by 61%. This modulation reduces toxic Pb leakage rates by 24-fold, with only &#8764;23 ppb Pb in water after severely damaged PSCs are immersed in water for 150 h.This strategy can also enhance chemical homogeneity, reduce trap density, release tensile strain and optimize carrier dynamics of Sn-Pb perovskites and relevant devices. Encouragingly, the power conversion efficiency (PCEs) of 23.28% for single-junction, full-stack devices and 21.34% for hole transport layer-free Sn-Pb PSCs are achieved.Notably, the related monolithic all-perovskite tandem solar cell also achieves a PCE of 27.03% with outstanding photostability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating the Double&#8208;Way Traffic of Cations and Anions in Ambipolar Polymer Cathodes for High&#8208;Performing Aluminum Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bipolar donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type conjugated polymer cathodes with the co&#8208;storage of AlCl4&#8722; and AlCl2+ are designed for aluminum dual&#8208;ion batteries. The regulated double&#8208;way traffic of cation and anion charge carriers through optimal donor/acceptor match enables the resultant polymer cathode to show a high capacity of 205&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, fast kinetics, and function efficiently at high mass loadings, i.e., 100 mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The strong Coulombic interactions between Al3+ and traditional inorganic crystalline cathodes present a significant obstacle in developing high&#8208;performance rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) that hold promise for safe and sustainable stationary energy storage. While accommodating chloroaluminate ions (AlCl4&#8722;, AlCl2+, etc.) in redox&#8208;active organic compounds offers a promising solution for RABs, the issues of dissolution and low ionic/electronic conductivities plague the development of organic cathodes. Herein, electron donors are synthetically connected with acceptors to create crosslinked, bipolar&#8208;conjugated polymer cathodes. These cathodes exhibit overlapped redox potential ranges for both donors and acceptors in highly concentrated AlCl3&#8208;based ionic liquid electrolytes. This approach strategically enables on&#8208;site doping of the polymer backbones during redox reactions involving both donor and acceptor units, thereby enhancing the electron/ion transfer kinetics within the resultant polymer cathodes. Based on the optimal donor/acceptor combination, the bipolar polymer cathodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 205&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 by leveraging the co&#8208;storage of AlCl4&#8722; and AlCl2+. The electrodes exhibit excellent rate performance, a stable cycle life of 60&#160;000 cycles, and function efficiently at high mass loadings, i.e., 100&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, and at low temperatures, i.e., &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The findings exemplify the exploration of high&#8208;performing conjugated polymer cathodes for RABs through rational structural design.

         <title>Accelerating the Rate&#8208;Determining Steps of Sulfur Conversion Reaction for Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries Working at an Ultrawide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous bismuth vanadate spheres have been used as sulfur host material, which achieve the rapid snap&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalytic process by shortening lithium&#8208;ion transport pathway and targeted accelerating rate&#8208;determining steps. Such the promoting effect greatly inhibits severe &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; at high temperatures and improves sulfur conversion efficiency in the cryogenic environment.








Abstract
Wide operation temperature is the crucial objective for an energy storage system that can be applied under harsh environmental conditions. For lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, the &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfide intermediates will aggravate with the temperature increasing, while the reaction kinetics decreases sharply as the temperature decreasing. In particular, sulfur reaction mechanism at low temperatures seems to be quite different from that at room temperature. Here, through in situ Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies, the newly emerged platform at cryogenic temperature corresponds to the reduction process of Li2S8 to Li2S4, which will be another rate&#8208;determining step of sulfur conversion reaction, in addition to the solid&#8208;phase conversion process of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S at low temperatures. Porous bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) spheres are designed as sulfur host material, which achieve the rapid snap&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalytic process by shortening lithium&#8208;ion transport pathway and accelerating the targeted rate&#8208;determining steps. Such promoting effect greatly inhibits severe &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; at high temperatures and simultaneously improves sulfur conversion efficiency in the cryogenic environment. The cell with the porous BiVO4 spheres as the host exhibits excellent rate capability and cycle performance under wide working temperatures.

         <title>A Novel PiGF@Diamond Color Converter with a Record Thermal Conductivity for Laser&#8208;Driven Projection Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel color converting architecture of phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;glass film on transparent diamond (PiGF@diamond) is reported. Thermal conductivity of the PiGF@diamond reaches a record value of 599.3 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, making it bear the laser power density up to 40.24 W mm&#8722;2 and a maximum luminance flux of 5602 lm without luminescence saturation. This enables its promising application in high&#8208;color rendering laser&#8208;driven projection display.








Abstract
High&#8208;brightness laser lighting is confronted with crucial challenges in developing laser&#8208;excitable color converting materials with effective heat dissipation and super optical performance. Herein, a novel composite of phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;glass film on transparent diamond (PiGF@diamond) is designed and fabricated via a facile low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;sintering strategy. The as&#8208;prepared La3Si6N11:Ce3+ (LSN:Ce) PiGF@diamond with well&#8208;retained optical properties of raw phosphor shows a record thermal conductivity of &#8776;599 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, which is about 60 times higher than that of currently well&#8208;used PiGF@sapphire (&#8776;10 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). As a consequence, this color converter can bear laser power density up to 40.24 W mm&#8722;2 and a maximum luminance flux of 5602&#160;lm without luminescence saturation due to efficient inhibition of laser&#8208;induced heat accumulation. By further supplementing red spectral component of CaAlSiN3:Eu2+ (CASN:Eu), the PiGF@diamond based white laser diode is successfully constructed, which can yield warm white light with a high color rendering index of 89.3 and find practical LD&#8208;driven applications. The findings will pave the way for realizing the commercial application of PiGF composite in laser lighting and display.

A trident photoswitch molecule doping strategy is proposed to simultaneously balance the cohesion&#8208;adhesion trade&#8208;off and overcome the conflict of strong adhesion and easy detachment for the magic transformation of commercial polymers into tough yet smart switchable adhesives, which integrates high bonding strength, remarkable switch ratio, extended reuses and broad harsh&#8208;condition adaptability.








Abstract
Here, a trident molecule doping strategy is introduced to overcome both cohesion&#8208;adhesion trade&#8208;off and adhesion&#8208;switchability conflict, transforming commercial polymers into tough yet photo&#8208;switchable adhesives. The strategy involves initial rational design of new trident photoswitch molecules namely TAzo&#8208;3 featuring azobenzene and hydroxy&#8208;terminated alkyl chains involved rigid&#8208;soft tri&#8208;branch structure, and subsequent doping into commercial polycaprolactone (PCL) via simple blending. Unique design enables TAzo&#8208;3 as a versatile dopant, not only regulating the internal and external supramolecular interaction to balance cohesion and interface adhesion for tough bonding, but also affording marked photothermal effect to facilitate rapid adhesive melting for great photo&#8208;switchability. Thus, the optimal TAzo&#8208;3&#8208;doped PCL (TAzo&#8208;3@P) displays markedly&#8208;improved bonding performance on diverse substrates compared to linear azobenzene&#8208;doped PCL and pure PCL. Impressively, TAzo&#8208;3@P on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) attains large room&#8208;temperature adhesion strength of 6.7&#160;MPa &#8211; surpassing most reported adhesives and many commercial adhesives on PMMA, along with easy photo&#8208;induced detachment with remarkable switch ratio of 2.09&#160;&#215;&#160;105. Besides, TAzo&#8208;3@P can also act as &#8220;permanent&#8221; adhesives for only adhesion, demonstrating excellent multi&#8208;reusability, anti&#8208;freezing and waterproof ability. Mechanism studies unveil that the switchable adhesion is closely linked with the dopant molecule structure while rigid&#8208;soft coupled trident structures and hydroxy&#8208;terminated alkyl chains are key factors.

&lt;p&gt;A trident photoswitch molecule doping strategy is proposed to simultaneously balance the cohesion-adhesion trade-off and overcome the conflict of strong adhesion and easy detachment for the magic transformation of commercial polymers into tough yet smart switchable adhesives, which integrates high bonding strength, remarkable switch ratio, extended reuses and broad harsh-condition adaptability.

&lt;p&gt;Here, a trident molecule doping strategy is introduced to overcome both cohesion-adhesion trade-off and adhesion-switchability conflict, transforming commercial polymers into tough yet photo-switchable adhesives. The strategy involves initial rational design of new trident photoswitch molecules namely TAzo-3 featuring azobenzene and hydroxy-terminated alkyl chains involved rigid-soft tri-branch structure, and subsequent doping into commercial polycaprolactone (PCL) via simple blending. Unique design enables TAzo-3 as a versatile dopant, not only regulating the internal and external supramolecular interaction to balance cohesion and interface adhesion for tough bonding, but also affording marked photothermal effect to facilitate rapid adhesive melting for great photo-switchability. Thus, the optimal TAzo-3-doped PCL (TAzo-3@P) displays markedly-improved bonding performance on diverse substrates compared to linear azobenzene-doped PCL and pure PCL.

         <title>Compliant Lattice Modulations Enable Anomalous Elasticity in Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga Martensite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike any other crystalline metal, modulated Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga can achieve large reversible strains under mechanical loads comparable to a fingertip grip force. Dedicated laser&#8208;ultrasonic measurements on this material reveal that it has locally nearly zero elastic stiffness with respect to shear loads that modify the lattice modulations. This anomalous compliance makes Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga crystal one of the most elastically anisotropic materials ever reported, and is the key for understanding its peculiar mechanical instability and for searching for new materials with similar functionality.








Abstract
High mobility of twin boundaries in modulated martensites of Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga&#8208;based ferromagnetic shape memory alloys holds a promise for unique magnetomechanical applications. This feature has not been fully understood so far, and in particular, it has yet not been unveiled what makes the lattice mechanics of modulated Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga specifically different from other martensitic alloys. Here, results of dedicated laser&#8208;ultrasonic measurements on hierarchically twinned five&#8208;layer modulated (10M) crystals fill this gap. Using a combination of transient grating spectroscopy and laser&#8208;based resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, it is confirmed that there is a shear elastic instability in the lattice, being significantly stronger than in any other martensitic material and also than what the first&#8208;principles calculations for Ni&#8211;Mn&#8211;Ga predict. The experimental results reveal that the instability is directly related to the lattice modulations. A lattice&#8208;scale mechanism of dynamic faulting of the modulation sequence that explains this behavior is proposed; this mechanism can explain the extraordinary mobility of twin boundaries in 10M.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Biased Bionic Fingertip E&#8208;Skin with Multimodal Tactile Perception and Artificial Intelligence for Augmented Touch Awareness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an intelligent E&#8208;skin featuring a minimalist design and versatile functions. Based on zero&#8208;biased triboelectric&#8208;based and ionic hydrogel&#8208;based artificial neurons, it realizes high&#8208;accuracy perception of surface texture, roughness, hardness, material, and temperature with only a single sensing unit, empowered by multimodal tactile sensing capability and artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Electronic skins (E&#8208;Skins) are crucial for future robotics and wearable devices to interact with and perceive the real world. Prior research faces challenges in achieving comprehensive tactile perception and versatile functionality while keeping system simplicity for lack of multimodal sensing capability in a single sensor. Two kinds of tactile sensors, transient voltage artificial neuron (TVAN) and sustained potential artificial neuron (SPAN), featuring self&#8208;generated zero&#8208;biased signals are developed to realize synergistic sensing of multimodal information (vibration, material, texture, pressure, and temperature) in a single device instead of complex sensor arrays. Simultaneously, machine learning with feature fusion is applied to fully decode their output information and compensate for the inevitable instability of applied force, speed, etc, in real applications. Integrating TVAN and SPAN, the formed E&#8208;Skin achieves holistic touch awareness in only a single unit. It can thoroughly perceive an object through a simple touch without strictly controlled testing conditions, realize the capability to discern surface roughness from 0.8 to 1600&#160;&#181;m, hardness from 6HA to 85HD, and correctly distinguish 16 objects with temperature variance from 0 to 80&#160;&#176;C. The E&#8208;skin also features a simple and scalable fabrication process, which can be integrated into various devices for broad applications.

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Inspired Formable Wood&#8208;Based Phase Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, muscle&#8208;inspired, formable wood&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) are fabricated by leveraging the aligned structure of delignified wood and supramolecular networks of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/wood composites. The biodegradable PVA/wood composite with solvent&#8208;responsive characteristics between wood fibers and PVA chains enables the development of wood&#8208;based PCMs with switchable stiffness, making them formable and sustainable for versatile thermal management applications.








Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) are crucial for sustainable thermal management in energy&#8208;efficient construction and cold chain logistics, as they can store and release renewable thermal energy. However, traditional PCMs suffer from leakage and a loss of formability above their phase change temperatures, limiting their shape stability and versatility. Inspired by the muscle structure, formable PCMs with a hierarchical structure and solvent&#8208;responsive supramolecular networks based on polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/wood composites are developed. The material, in its hydrated state, demonstrates low stiffness and pliability due to the weak hydrogen bonding between aligned wood fibers and PVA molecules. Through treatment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into the PVA/wood PEG gel (PEG/PVA/W) with strengthened hydrogen bonds, the resulting wood&#8208;based PCMs in the hard and melting states elevate the tensile stress from 10.14 to 80.86&#160;MPa and the stiffness from 420&#160;MPa to 4.8&#160;GPa, making it 530 times stiffer than the PEG/PVA counterpart. Capable of morphing in response to solvent changes, these formable PCMs enable intricate designs for thermal management. Furthermore, supported by a comprehensive life cycle assessment, these shape&#8208;adaptable, recyclable, and biodegradable PCMs with lower environmental footprint present a sustainable alternative to conventional plastics and thermal management materials.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Thin WS2 Kirigami for Bidirectional Polarization Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art WS2 nano&#8208;kirigami structures with various layer combinations and stacking configurations are synthesized by space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition method. With this obtained special stacking structure and unique etching channel, the metasurface is specially designed and integrated to achieve a photodetector with bidirectional polarization&#8208;sensitive detection capability in the infrared spectrum.








Abstract
The assembly and patterning engineering in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials hold importance for chip&#8208;level designs incorporating multifunctional detectors. At present, the patterning and stacking methods of 2D materials inevitably introduce impurity instability and functional limitations. Here, the space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition method is employed to achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art kirigami structures of self&#8208;assembled WS2, featuring various layer combinations and stacking configurations. With this technique as a foundation, the WS2 nano&#8208;kirigami is integrated with metasurface design, achieving a photodetector with bidirectional polarization&#8208;sensitive detection capability in the infrared spectrum. Nano&#8208;kirigami can eliminate some of the uncontrollable factors in the processing of 2D material devices, providing a freely designed platform for chip&#8208;level multifunctional detection across multiple modules.

With this technique as a foundation, the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nano-kirigami is integrated with metasurface design, achieving a photodetector with bidirectional polarization-sensitive detection capability in the infrared spectrum. Nano-kirigami can eliminate some of the uncontrollable factors in the processing of 2D material devices, providing a freely designed platform for chip-level multifunctional detection across multiple modules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Porous Li&#8211;Al Alloy Anode toward High&#8208;Performance Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous Li&#8211;Al alloy anode exhibits a record critical current density of 6.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 5000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells, and 1800 cycles (83% retention) and the highest areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 in LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#8208;based full cells at room temperature.








Abstract
Compared to lithium (Li) anode, the alloy/Li&#8208;alloy anodes show more compatible with sulfide solid electrolytes (SSEs), and are promising candidates for practical SSE&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries (ASSLBs). In this work, a porous Li&#8211;Al alloy (LiAl&#8208;p) anode is crafted using a straightforward mechanical pressing method. Various characterizations confirm the porous nature of such anode, as well as rich oxygen species on its surface. To the best knowledge, such LiAl&#8208;p anode demonstrates the best room temperature cell performance in comparison with reported Li and alloy/Li&#8208;alloy anodes in SSE&#8208;based ASSLBs. For example, the LiAl&#8208;p symmetric cells deliver a record critical current density of 6.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an ultralong cycling of 5000&#160;h; the LiAl&#8208;p|LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 full cells achieve a high areal capacity of 11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2 and excellent durability of 1800 cycles. Further in situ and ex situ experiments reveal that the porous structure can accommodate volume changes of LiAl&#8208;p and ensure its integrity during cycling; and moreover, a robust Li inorganics&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase can be formed originated from the reaction between SSE and surface oxygen species of LiAl&#8208;p. This study offers inspiration for designing high&#8208;performance alloy anodes by focusing on designing special architecture to alleviate volume change and constructing stable interphase.

         <title>An Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor Structured Nano&#8208;Aggregate for NIR&#8208;Triggered Interventional Photoimmunotherapy of Cervical Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;structured nanoaggregate is developed with dual phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), triggered by single near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. In combination with aluminum adjuvant gel, a novel photoimmunotherapy strategy for cervical cancer is developed and demonstrated to significantly inhibit primary and metastatic tumors in vivo.








Abstract
Compared with conventional therapies, photoimmunotherapy offers precise targeted cancer treatment with minimal damage to healthy tissues and reduced side effects, but its efficacy may be limited by shallow light penetration and the potential for tumor resistance. Here, an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A)&#8208;structured nanoaggregate is developed with dual phototherapy, including photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), triggered by single near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light. Benefiting from strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;structured nanoaggregates exhibit broad absorption extending to the NIR region and effectively suppressed fluorescence, which enables deep penetration and efficient photothermal conversion (&#951;&#160;=&#160;67.94%). A suitable HOMO&#8211;LUMO distribution facilitates sufficient intersystem crossing (ISC) to convert ground&#8208;state oxygen (3O2) to singlet oxygen (1O2) and superoxide anions (&#183;O2&#8722;), and catalyze hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) generation. The enhanced ICT and ISC effects endow the A&#8211;D&#8211;A structured nanoaggregates with efficient PTT and PDT for cervical cancer, inducing efficient immunogenic cell death. In combination with clinical aluminum adjuvant gel, a novel photoimmunotherapy strategy for cervical cancer is developed and demonstrated to significantly inhibit primary and metastatic tumors in orthotopic and intraperitoneal metastasis cervical cancer animal models. The noninvasive therapy strategy offers new insights for clinical early&#8208;stage and advanced cervical cancer treatment.

         <title>Olivine&#8208;Type Fe2GeX4 (X = S, Se, and Te): A Novel Class of Anode Materials for Exceptional Sodium Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The investigation in Na+ storage properties in Fe2GeX4 (X = S, Se, and Te) reveals their superior electrochemical performance and a combined intercalation&#8208;conversion&#8208;alloying reaction pathway, with the alloying process dominating capacity and determining the rate of Fe2GeS4 and Fe2GeSe4. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that Fe2GeS4 preferentially adsorbs Na&#8314; onto coexistence regions of Fe&#8208;S octahedral and Ge&#8208;S tetrahedral. Conversely, Fe2GeSe4 and Fe2GeTe4 exhibit homogeneous adsorption.








Abstract
The introduction of abundant metals to form ternary germanium&#8208;based chalcogenides can dilute the high price and effectively buffer the volume variation of germanium. Herein, olivine&#8208;structured Fe2GeX4 (X = S, Se, and Te) are synthesized by a chemical vapor transport method to compare their sodium storage properties. A series of in situ and ex situ measurements validate a combined intercalation&#8208;conversion&#8208;alloying reaction mechanism of Fe2GeX4. Fe2GeS4 exhibits a high capacity of 477.9&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 2660 cycles at 8 A g&#8722;1, and excellent rate capability. Furthermore, the Na3V2(PO4)3//Fe2GeS4 full cell delivers a capacity of 375.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, which is more than three times that of commercial hard carbon, with a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.23%. Capacity&#8208;contribution and kinetic analyses reveal that the alloying reaction significantly contributes to the overall capacity and serves as the rate&#8208;determining step within the reaction for both Fe2GeS4 and Fe2GeSe4. Upon reaching a specific cycle threshold, the assessment of the kinetic properties of Fe2GeX4 primarily relies on the ion diffusion process that occurs during charging. This work demonstrates that Fe2GeX4 possesses promising practical potential to outperform hard carbon, offering valuable insights and impetus for the advancement of ternary germanium&#8208;based anodes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Anchored Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Stacking Growth of Transition&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenide Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;anchored van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals stacking growth mechanism is developed to produce transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide nanoplates with desired lateral size and locations. As such, WSe2 and MoSe2 nanoplate arrays are produced for the subsequent fabrication of nanoplate&#8208;based optoelectronics.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) nanoplates exhibit unique properties different from their monolayer counterparts. Controllable nucleation and growth are prerequisite and highly desirable for their practical applications. Here, a self&#8208;anchored van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals stacking growth method is developed, by which the substrate pit induced by precursor etching anchors the source material, impedes the lateral spreading of source droplets and facilitates the in situ stacking growth of high&#8208;quality TMD nanoplates with a thickness of tens to hundreds of nanometers at well&#8208;defined locations. As such, an array of TMD nanoplates with controlled lateral dimensions are produced and applied in arrayed photodetectors.

&lt;p&gt;A self-anchored van-der-Waals stacking growth mechanism is developed to produce transition-metal dichalcogenide nanoplates with desired lateral size and locations. As such, WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplate arrays are produced for the subsequent fabrication of nanoplate-based optoelectronics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMDs) nanoplates exhibit unique properties different from their monolayer counterparts. Controllable nucleation and growth are prerequisite and highly desirable for their practical applications. Here, a self-anchored van-der-Waals stacking growth method is developed, by which the substrate pit induced by precursor etching anchors the source material, impedes the lateral spreading of source droplets and facilitates the in situ stacking growth of high-quality TMD nanoplates with a thickness of tens to hundreds of nanometers at well-defined locations.

         <title>A Dopamine&#8208;Modified Hyaluronic Acid&#8208;Based Mucus Carrying Phytoestrogen and Urinary Exosome for Thin Endometrium Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
CUEHD is an artificial mucus based on L&#8208;DOPA&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid combining phytoestrogen cajaninstilbene acid and rat urinary exosomes. Such a platform with long retention time and high biosafety promises good therapeutic efficacy in a rat model with thin endometrium. The improvement is manifested both in morphological endometrial thickness and fertility function.








Abstract
Thin endometrium (TE) is closely associated with infertility in reproductive medicine. Estrogen therapy gains unsatisfactory outcomes. In this study, an artificial mucus based on dopamine (L&#8208;DOPA)&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid combining phytoestrogen cajaninstilbene acid and rat urinary exosomes (CUEHD) is constructed for TE treatment using a rat TE model. In the rat TE model, the dominant elastic behavior and adhesive properties of CUEHD guarantee adequate retention, rendering superior synergistic treatment efficacy and favorable biosafety characteristics. CUEHD treatment significantly increases endometrial thickness and promotes receptivity and fertility. Mechanistically, estrogen homeostasis, inflammation inhibition, and endometrial regeneration are achieved through the crosstalk between ER&#8208;NLRP3&#8208;IL1&#946; and Wnt&#8208;&#946; catenin&#8208;TGF&#946;&#8208;smad signaling pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of exosomes from human urine and adipose tissue&#8208;derived stem cells (ADSCs) and rat ADSCs are also demonstrated, indicating extensive use of the artificial mucus system. Thus, this study illustrates a platform combining phytoestrogen and exosomes with promising implications for TE treatment.

         <title>A Multiferroic Spin&#8208;Crossover Molecular Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first molecular multiferroic crystal of Fe(II) spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) complex is successfully designed to show the coexistence of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and SCO behavior. It exhibits a 222F2 type ferroelectric/ferroelastic phase transition accompanied by spatial symmetry breaking and a spin transition involving d orbital breaking.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;crossover (SCO) ferroelectrics with dual&#8208;function switches have attracted great attention for significant magnetoelectric application prospects. However, the multiferroic crystals with SCO features have rarely been reported. Herein, a molecular multiferroic Fe(II) crystalline complex [FeII(C8&#8208;F&#8208;pbh)2] (1&#8208;F, C8&#8208;F&#8208;pbh = (1Z,N'E)&#8208;3&#8208;F&#8208;4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;N&#8217;&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;ylmethylene)&#8208;benzo&#8208;hydrazonate) showing the coexistence of ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity, and SCO behavior is presented for the first time. By H/F substitution, the low phase transition temperature (270&#160;K) of the non&#8208;fluorinated parent compound is significantly increased to 318&#160;K in 1&#8208;F, which exhibits a spatial symmetry breaking 222F2 type ferroelectric phase transition with clear room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity. Besides, 1&#8208;F also displays a spin transition between high&#8208; and low&#8208;spin states, accompanied by the d&#8208;orbital breaking within the t2g4eg2 and t2g6eg&#176; configuration change of octahedrally coordinated FeII center. Moreover, the 222F2 type ferroelectric phase transition is also a ferroelastic one, verified by the ferroelectric domains reversal and the evolution of ferroelastic domains. To the knowledge, 1&#8208;F is the first multiferroic SCO molecular crystal. This unprecedented finding sheds light on the exploration of molecular multistability materials for future smart devices.

         <title>Highly Conductive and Stretchable Hydrogel Nanocomposite Using Whiskered Gold Nanosheets for Soft Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High electrical conductivity (&#8776;520&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1) and high stretchability (&#8776;300%) are achieved simultaneously for conductive hydrogel nanocomposite, through a sequential formation method using whiskered gold nanosheets. The maximum conductivity reaches 3304&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. The conductive hydrogel nanocomposite functionalized with tissue adhesive property realizes robust integration with living organs, demonstrating high&#8208;performance bioelectronics in vivo.








Abstract
The low electrical conductivity of conductive hydrogels limits their applications as soft conductors in bioelectronics. This low conductivity originates from the high water content of hydrogels, which impedes facile carrier transport between conductive fillers. This study presents a highly conductive and stretchable hydrogel nanocomposite comprising whiskered gold nanosheets. A dry network of whiskered gold nanosheets is fabricated and then incorporated into the wet hydrogel matrices. The whiskered gold nanosheets preserve their tight interconnection in hydrogels despite the high water content, providing a high&#8208;quality percolation network even under stretched states. Regardless of the type of hydrogel matrix, the gold&#8208;hydrogel nanocomposites exhibit a conductivity of &#8776;520&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a stretchability of &#8776;300% without requiring a dehydration process. The conductivity reaches a maximum of &#8776;3304&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 when the density of the dry gold network is controlled. A gold&#8208;adhesive hydrogel nanocomposite, which can achieve conformal adhesion to moving organ surfaces, is fabricated for bioelectronics demonstrations. The adhesive hydrogel electrode outperforms elastomer&#8208;based electrodes in in vivo epicardial electrogram recording, epicardial pacing, and sciatic nerve stimulation.

         <title>Non&#8208;Centrosymmetric Single Crystalline Biomolecular Nano&#8208;Arrays for Responsive Electronics</title>

         <dc:description>
By integrating dip&#8208;pen nanolithography with solvent vapor annealing, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of nanoscale amino acid (AA) single crystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism. Importantly, these nanocrystals exhibit second harmonic generation (SHG), piezoelectric, and ferroelectric properties due to their non&#8208;centrosymmetric structures, making them potentially useful for sustainable electronics.








Abstract
Herein, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of single crystalline amino acid (AA) nanocrystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism by leveraging dip&#8208;pen nanolithography (DPN) and recrystallization via solvent vapor annealing. The crystals are prepared by first depositing nanoreactors consisting of a solvent with AAs, followed by water vapor&#8208;induced recrystallization. This leads to isotropic structures that are non&#8208;centrosymmetric with strong piezoelectric (g33 coefficients &gt;1000&#160;mVm&#160;N&#8722;1), ferroelectric, and non&#8208;linear optical properties. However, recrystallizing arrays of isotropic DL&#8208;alanine nanodot features with a binary solvent (water and ethanol) leads to arrays of 1D piezoelectric nanorods with their long axis coincident with the polar axis. Moreover, positioning nanoreactors containing AAs (the nanodot features) between micro electrodes leads to capillary formation, making the reactors anisotropic and facilitating piezoelectric nanorod formation between the electrodes. This offers a facile route to device fabrication. These as&#8208;fabricated devices respond to ultrasonic stimulation in the form of a piezoelectric response. The technique described herein is significant as it provides a rapid way of investigating non&#8208;centrosymmetric nanoscale biocrystals, potentially pivotal for fabricating a new class of stimuli&#8208;responsive devices such as sensors, energy harvesters, and stimulators.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a novel strategy is reported for synthesizing libraries of single crystalline amino acid (AA) nanocrystals with control over size, anisotropy, and polymorphism by leveraging dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) and recrystallization via solvent vapor annealing. The crystals are prepared by first depositing nanoreactors consisting of a solvent with AAs, followed by water vapor-induced recrystallization. This leads to isotropic structures that are non-centrosymmetric with strong piezoelectric (g&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; coefficients &amp;gt;1000&#160;mVm&#160;N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), ferroelectric, and non-linear optical properties. However, recrystallizing arrays of isotropic DL-alanine nanodot features with a binary solvent (water and ethanol) leads to arrays of 1D piezoelectric nanorods with their long axis coincident with the polar axis. Moreover, positioning nanoreactors containing AAs (the nanodot features) between micro electrodes leads to capillary formation, making the reactors anisotropic and facilitating piezoelectric nanorod formation between the electrodes. This offers a facile route to device fabrication. These as-fabricated devices respond to ultrasonic stimulation in the form of a piezoelectric response. The technique described herein is significant as it provides a rapid way of investigating non-centrosymmetric nanoscale biocrystals, potentially pivotal for fabricating a new class of stimuli-responsive devices such as sensors, energy harvesters, and stimulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circadian Rhythm&#8208;Regulated ADSC&#8208;Derived sEVs and a Triphasic Microneedle Delivery System to Enhance Tendon&#8208;to&#8208;Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized circadian rhythms in ADSCs enhance the production and the inflammatory regulatory capacity of their secreted sEVs (CR&#8208;sEVs). These CR&#8208;sEVs inhibit macrophage M1 polarization by modulating the cAMP signaling pathway via PF4 delivery. Delivered via a triphasic microneedle in a rat rotator cuff repair model, CR&#8208;sEVs/MN reduces inflammation, facilitates fibrocartilage regeneration, enhances tendon repair, and ultimately promotes tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing.








Abstract
Modulating the inflammatory microenvironment to reconstruct the fibrocartilaginous layer while promoting tendon repair is crucial for enhancing tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in rotator cuff repair (RCR), a persistent challenge in orthopedics. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) hold significant potential to modulate inflammation, yet the efficient production of highly bioactive sEVs remains a substantial barrier to their clinical application. Moreover, achieving minimally invasive local delivery of sEVs to the tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone interface presents significant technical difficulties. Herein, the circadian rhythm of adipose&#8208;derived stem cells is modulated to increase the yield and enhance the inflammatory regulatory capacity of sEVs. Circadian rhythm&#8208;regulated sEVs (CR&#8208;sEVs) enhance the cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling pathway in macrophage (M&#966;) via platelet factor 4 delivery, thereby inhibiting M&#966; M1 polarization. Subsequently, a triphasic microneedle (MN) scaffold with a tip, stem, and base is designed for the local delivery of CR&#8208;sEVs (CR&#8208;sEVs/MN) at the tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone junction, incorporating tendon&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix in the base to facilitate tendon repair. CR&#8208;sEVs/MN mitigates inflammation, promotes fibrocartilage regeneration, and enhances tendon healing, thereby improving biomechanical strength and shoulder joint function in a rat RCR model. Combining CR&#8208;sEVs with this triphasic microneedle delivery system presents a promising strategy for enhancing tendon&#8208;to&#8208;bone healing in clinical settings.

         <title>Shape Memory Polymers with Patternable Recovery Onset Regulated by Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape memory hydrogel with a photo&#8208;patterned onset time of autonomous shape recovery is prepared. Via introducing photo&#8208;responsive nitrocinnamate groups, thermally induced reversible microphase separation of the material is adjusted, which is responsible for the tunable recovery onset. Consequently, multi&#8208;shape morphing without any external stimulation can be realized, greatly extending the versatility of shape memory polymers.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) show attractive prospects in emerging fields such as soft robots and biomedical devices. Although their typical trigger&#8208;responsive character offers the essential shape&#8208;changing controllability, having to access external stimulation is a major bottleneck toward many applications. Recently emerged autonomous SMPs exhibit unique stimuli&#8208;free shape&#8208;shifting behavior with its controllability achieved via a delayed and programmable recovery onset. Achieving multi&#8208;shape morphing in an arbitrary fashion, however, is infeasible. In this work, a molecular design that allows to spatio&#8208;temporally define the recovery onset of an autonomous shape memory hydrogel (SMH) is reported. By introducing nitrocinnamate groups onto an SMH, its crosslinking density can be adjusted by light. This affects greatly the phase separation kinetics, which is the basis for the autonomous shape memory behavior. Consequently, the recovery onset can be regulated between 0 to 85&#160;min. With masked light, multiple recovery onsets in an arbitrarily defined pattern which correspondingly enable multi&#8208;shape morphing can be realized. This ability to achieve highly sophisticated morphing without relying on any external stimulation greatly extends the versatility of SMPs.

         <title>Branched Oligomer&#8208;Based Reversible Adhesives Enabled by Controllable Self&#8208;Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The smart supramolecular adhesive based on small molecules suffers from low adhesion strength and narrow designability. Herein, a strong tough, and large&#8208;span rapid reversible adhesive is designed through controlling branched oligomer self&#8208;aggregation strategy with design flexibility and reversible double cross&#8208;linking interactions. This work makes it possible to design reversible adhesives with long&#8208;span outstanding properties using covalent polymers.








Abstract
Supramolecular adhesion material systems based on small molecules have shown great potential to unite the great contradiction between strong adhesion and reversibility. However, these material systems suffer from low adhesion strength/narrow adhesion span, limited designability, and single interaction due to fewer covalent bond content and action sites in small molecules. Herein, an ultrahigh&#8208;strength and large&#8208;span reversible adhesive enabled by a branched oligomer controllable self&#8208;aggregation strategy is developed. The dense covalent bonds present in the branched oligomers greatly enhance adhesion strength without compromising reversibility. The resulting adhesive exhibits a large&#8208;span reversible adhesion of &#8776;140 times, switching between ultra&#8208;strong and tough adhesion strength (5.58&#160;MPa and 5093.92&#160;N&#160;m&#8722;1) and ultralow adhesion (0.04&#160;MPa and 87.656&#160;N&#160;m&#8722;1) with alternating temperature. Moreover, reversible dynamic double cross&#8208;linking endows the adhesive with stable reversible adhesion transitions even after 100 cycles. This reversible adhesion property can also be remotely controlled via a voltage of 8&#160;V, with a loading voltage duration of 45&#160;s. This work paves the way for the design of reversible adhesives with long&#8208;span outstanding properties using covalent polymers and offers a pathway for the rational design of high&#8208;performance adhesives featuring both robust toughness and exceptional reversibility.

         <title>Regulation of Electron Delocalization Region in 2D Heteroligand&#8208;Based Copper&#8208;Organic Framework to Enhance NH4+$ \rm {NH_{4}}{^+}$ Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroligand&#8208;based 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated copper&#8208;organic framework has been synthesized by a simple solvothermal method. Benefitting from the effective regulation of electron delocalization by heteroligand and the inherent hydrogen bond cage mechanism between ammonium ions, the as&#8208;prepared heteroligand&#8208;based 2D copper&#8208;organic framework as cathode can realize high&#8208;performance ammonium ion storage in sustainable aqueous ammonium ion batteries.








Abstract
The rechargeable aqueous ammonium ion battery shows great potential in low&#8208;cost energy storage system because of its long life and environmental friendliness. However, most inorganic host materials used in ammonium ion batteries are still limited by slow diffusion kinetics. Herein, it is identified that a 2D heteroligand&#8208;based copper&#8208;organic framework featuring numerous ammonium ion adsorption site in the &#960;&#8208;conjugated periodic skeleton supplies multiple accessible redox&#8208;active sites for high&#8208;performance ammonium storage. Benefitting from the effective regulation of electron delocalization by heteroligand and the inherent hydrogen bond cage mechanism between ammonium ions, the resultant full battery delivers a large specific energy density of 211.84&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1, and it can be stably operated for 12000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 for over 80 days. This explanatory understanding provides a new idea for the rational design of high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based ammonium ion battery cathode materials for efficient energy storage and conversion in the future.

         <title>Photocatalytic Carbon Dots&#8208;Triggered Pyroptosis for Whole Cancer Cell Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;induced pyroptotic cancer cells (PCIP), as a potential candidate for whole cancer cell vaccines (WCCV), can be used for effective tumor immunoprevention. In vivo, assessments reveal that PCIP induced specific immune&#8208;preventive effects through anticancer immune memory, demonstrating effective WCCV. This study provides a facile strategy that utilized photocatalytic CDs to induce pyroptosis of cancer cells for fabricating WCCV.








Abstract
Manufacturing whole cancer cell vaccines (WCCV) with both biosafety and efficacy is crucial for tumor immunotherapy. Pyroptotic cancer cells, due to their highly immunogenic properties, present a promising avenue for the development of WCCV. However, the successful development of WCCV based on pyroptotic cancer cells is yet to be accomplished. Here, a facile strategy that utilized photocatalytic carbon dots (CDs) to induce pyroptosis of cancer cells for fabricating WCCV is reported. Photocatalytic CDs are capable of generating substantial amounts of hydroxyl radicals and can effectively decrease cytoplasmic pH values under white light irradiation. This process efficiently triggers cancer cell pyroptosis through the reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;mitochondria&#8208;caspase 3&#8208;gasdermin E pathway and the proton motive force&#8208;driven mitochondrial ATP synthesis pathway. Moreover, in vitro, these photocatalytic CDs&#8208;induced pyroptotic cancer cells (PCIP) can hyperactivate macrophage (M0&#8211;M1) with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II expression. In vivo, PCIP induced specific immune&#8208;preventive effects in melanoma and breast cancer mouse models through anticancer immune memory, demonstrating effective WCCV. This work provides novel insights for inducing cancer cell pyroptosis and bridges the gap in the fabrication of WCCV based on pyroptotic cancer cells.

         <title>Dynamically Precise Constructing Dual&#8208;Atom Pd2 Catalyst:A Monodisperse Catalyst With High Stability for Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation of Alkyne</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomically dispersed Pd2 DAC constructed by the dynamic strategy exhibits higher activity and selectivity than that of Pd1 SAC and Pd2 NC in the semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes. DFT calculations and systematic experiments confirm the high performance of Pd2 DAC is due to the synergistic effect of dynamically generated Pd&#9472;Pd bonds.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) originate unprecedented reactivity and maximize resource efficiency. The fundamental difficulty lies in the high complexity and instability of DACs, making the rational design and targeted performance optimization a grand challenge. Here, an atomically dispersed Pd2 DAC with an in situ generated Pd&#9472;Pd bond is constructed by a dynamic strategy, which achieves high activity and selectivity for semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes and functional internal acetylene, twice higher than commercial Lindlar catalyst. Density functional theory calculations and systematic experiments confirms the ultrahigh properties of Pd2 DAC originates from the synergistic effect of the dynamically generated Pd&#9472;Pd bonds. This discovery highlights the potential for dynamic strategies and opens unprecedented possibilities for the preparation of robust DACs on an industrial scale.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Conformal Wearable Ultrasound Patch for Continuous Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a portable, wearable ultrasound system for continuous sonodynamic therapy. The integration of a multiplexed ultrasonic patch array possesses ability to accurately focus on lesion sites and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), ultimately driving the extinction of tumor tissue from the inside out. This study provides a promising approach to noninvasively, continuously, and efficiently treat deep tumors.








Abstract
Cancer treatment is a continuous process, that the current therapy cannot meet the requirement well, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Wearable ultrasound device has the potential for continuous sonodynamic therapy due to its portability. However, the miniaturization of ultrasonic probe, system integration of device, and the strategy of continuous treatment are still urgent issues to be addressed. Herein, a portable wearable antitumor system is introduced, which utilizes a custom&#8208;developed multiplexed ultrasonic patch array (CWUS Patch) to accurately focus ultrasound on the lesion site and controllably stimulate sonosensitizer to produce a large amount of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). The system enables dynamic control of the ultrasound patches and allows real&#8208;time adjustments to optimize their performance in various applications, providing greater flexibility and precision in healthcare technology. Furthermore, the excellent penetration property of ultrasound into tumor tissues that induce synchronous apoptosis of tumor cells from the inside out is verified through a mouse model of breast cancer. This fully integrated conformal wearable ultrasound system provides a promising approach to noninvasively, continuously, and efficiently treat deep tumors.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted Recovery of Sodium Metal Anodes for High&#8208;Rate Capability Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an alkali salt&#8208;assisted assembly&#8208;polymerization strategy to recover Na activity and reinforce solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase that consists of inner O&#8211;Si&#8211;O networks and outer hydrophobic epoxides. In consequence, the modified Na anodes can not only achieve their electrochemical recovery, but also withstand moisture air attacking and high current&#8208;density cycling.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium metal batteries are considered to be one of the most promising high energy density and cost&#8208;effective electrochemical energy storage systems. However, their practicality is constrained by the high reactivity of sodium metal anodes that readily brings about excessive accumulation of inactive Na species on the surface, either by chemical reactions with oxygen and moisture during electrode handling or through electrochemical processes with electrolytes during battery operation. Herein, this paper reports on an alkali, salt&#8208;assisted, assembly&#8208;polymerization strategy to recover Na activity and to reinforce the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) of sodium metal anodes. To achieve this, an alkali&#8208;reactive coupling agent 3&#8208;glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GPTMS) is applied to convert inactive Na species into Si&#8211;O&#8211;Na coordination with a self&#8208;assembly GPTMS layer that consists of inner O&#8211;Si&#8211;O networks and outer hydrophobic epoxides. As a result, the electrochemical activity of Na metal anodes can be fully recovered and the robust GPTMS&#8208;derived SEI layer ensures high capacity and long&#8208;term cycling under an ultrahigh rate of 30 C (93.1 mAh g&#8722;1, 94.8% after 3000 cycles). This novel process provides surface engineering clues on designing high power density and cost&#8208;effective alkaline metal batteries.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Catalytic NO/O2 Gas&#8208;Releasing Nanozyme for Radiotherapy Sensitization through Vascular Normalization and Hypoxia Relief</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Radiotherapy (RT) stands as a cornerstone treatment for nearly all types of cancers, but it is significantly challenged by tumor hypoxia and subsequent radioresistance. This work introduces a pioneering prosthetic&#8208;Arginine coassembled nanozyme system, HRRu&#8208;HFn, designed to counteract these challenges by directly delivering nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) to the tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT), essential for treating various cancers, faces challenges from tumor hypoxia, which induces radioresistance. A tumor&#8208;targeted &#8220;prosthetic&#8208;Arginine&#8221; coassembled nanozyme system, engineered to catalytically generate nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O2) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), overcoming hypoxia and enhancing radiosensitivity is presented. This system integrates the prosthetic heme of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and catalase (CAT) with NO&#8208;donating Fmoc&#8208;protected Arginine and Ru3+ ions, creating HRRu nanozymes that merge NOS and CAT functionalities. Surface modification with human heavy chain ferritin (HFn) improves the targeting ability of nanozymes (HRRu&#8208;HFn) to tumor tissues. In the TME, strategic arginine incorporation within the nanozyme allows autonomous O2 and NO release, triggered by endogenous hydrogen peroxide, elevating NO and O2 levels to normalize vasculature and improve blood perfusion, thus mitigating hypoxia. Employing the intrinsic O2&#8208;transporting ability of heme, HRRu&#8208;HFn nanozymes also deliver O2 directly to the tumor site. Utilizing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as a tumor model, the studies reveal that the synergistic functions of NO and O2 production, alongside targeted delivery, enable the HRRu&#8208;HFn nanozymes to combat tumor hypoxia and potentiate radiotherapy. This HRRu&#8208;HFn nanozyme based approach holds the potential to reduce the radiation dose required and minimize side effects associated with conventional radiotherapy.

This work introduces a pioneering prosthetic-Arginine coassembled nanozyme system, HRRu-HFn, designed to counteract these challenges by directly delivering nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to the tumor microenvironment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy (RT), essential for treating various cancers, faces challenges from tumor hypoxia, which induces radioresistance. A tumor-targeted &#8220;prosthetic-Arginine&#8221; coassembled nanozyme system, engineered to catalytically generate nitric oxide (NO) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the tumor microenvironment (TME), overcoming hypoxia and enhancing radiosensitivity is presented. This system integrates the prosthetic heme of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and catalase (CAT) with NO-donating Fmoc-protected Arginine and Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, creating HRRu nanozymes that merge NOS and CAT functionalities. Surface modification with human heavy chain ferritin (HFn) improves the targeting ability of nanozymes (HRRu-HFn) to tumor tissues. In the TME, strategic arginine incorporation within the nanozyme allows autonomous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO release, triggered by endogenous hydrogen peroxide, elevating NO and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels to normalize vasculature and improve blood perfusion, thus mitigating hypoxia. Employing the intrinsic O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-transporting ability of heme, HRRu-HFn nanozymes also deliver O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly to the tumor site. Utilizing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma as a tumor model, the studies reveal that the synergistic functions of NO and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, alongside targeted delivery, enable the HRRu-HFn nanozymes to combat tumor hypoxia and potentiate radiotherapy. This HRRu-HFn nanozyme based approach holds the potential to reduce the radiation dose required and minimize side effects associated with conventional radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Superatomic Layer of Cubic Mo4S4 Clusters Connected by Cl Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation of Mo8S8Cl11, a superatomic layer with a sandwich structure of cubic Mo4S4 clusters connected by Cl cross&#8208;linking, is reported. This vapor&#8208;phase reaction within nanotubes promotes the selective growth of monolayer Mo8S8Cl11, thereby allowing for comprehensive characterization. This reaction further yields microscopic flakes containing Mo8S8Cl11, which exhibit significant catalytic activity for the hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction.








Abstract
Superatomic clusters &#8211; assemblies of atoms with various sizes, shapes, and compositions &#8211; can form hierarchical architectures that exhibit emergent electronic properties not found in their individual units. In particular, cubic M4X4 clusters of chalcogenides (M = transition metal; X = chalcogen) are recognized as versatile building blocks for 3D structures with tunable morphologies and electronic properties. However, tetrahedral M4X4 clusters rarely assemble into 2D architectures, which could offer a distinct class of functional materials from their 3D analogues. Here, this work reports the preparation of 2D Mo8S8Cl11, a superatomic layer with a sandwich structure consisting of Mo4S4 clusters interconnected through Cl cross&#8208;linking. The vapor&#8208;phase reaction inside nanotubes promotes the selective growth of Mo8S8Cl11 nanoribbons, allowing detailed characterization via transmission electron microscopy. This methodology can be applied to the growth of layered structures containing Mo8S8Cl11 at the micrometer scale. This work has demonstrated that mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layer Mo8S8Cl11 can be prepared by exfoliation of parent solids. Electronic structure calculations indicate that the 2D monolayer has quasi&#8208;flat bands, giving rise to an indirect&#8208;to&#8208;direct bandgap transition under mechanical strain. Furthermore, scanning electrochemical microscopy reveals the potential of the layered structures as highly efficient catalysts for the hydrogen&#8208;evolution reaction.

         <title>Unraveling the Capacitive Behaviors in Nanoconfined Ionophilic Carbon Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compressed micropore&#8208;rich carbon framework is synthesized with tailored monolayer and bilayer confinement pores. With compatible ionophilic interfaces, they accommodate both cations and anions in ionic liquid electrolytes. A voltage&#8208;induced gradient pore&#8208;filling process has been proposed to explain the capacitive storage mechanism.








Abstract
Intensifying the synergy between confined carbon nanopores and ionic liquids (ILs) and a deep comprehension of the ion behavior is required for enhancing the capacitive storage performance. Despite many theoretical insights on the storage mechanism, experimental verification has remained lacking due to the intricate nature of pore texture. Here, a compressed micropore&#8208;rich carbon framework (CMCF) with tailored monolayer and bilayer confinement pores is synthesized, which exhibits a compatible ionophilic interface to accommodate the IL [EMIM][BF4]. By deploying in situ Raman spectroscopy, in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance, the effect of the pore textures on ions storage behaviors is elucidated. A voltage&#8208;induced ion gradient filling process in these ionophilic pores is proposed, in which ion exchange and co&#8208;ion desorption dominate the charge storage process. Moreover, it is established that the monolayer confinement of ions enhances the capacity, and bilayer confinement facilitates the charging dynamics. This work may guide the design of nanoconfinement carbon for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density supercapacitors and deepen the understanding of the charge storage mechanism in ionophilic pores.

         <title>Consistent Thermal Conductivities of Spring&#8208;Like Structured Polydimethylsiloxane Composites under Large Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>

Spring&#8208;like thermal conduction pathways of AgNW effectively improve the thermal conductivity of PDMS composites and endow them with consistent thermal conduction performance during deformation.








Abstract
Flexible and highly thermally conductive materials with consistent thermal conductivity (&#955;) during large deformation are urgently required to address the heat accumulation in flexible electronics. In this study, spring&#8208;like thermal conduction pathways of silver nanowire (S&#8208;AgNW) fabricated by 3D printing are compounded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to prepare S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites with excellent and consistent &#955; during deformation. The S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites exhibit a &#955; of 7.63&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at an AgNW amount of 20 vol%, which is &#8776;42 times that of PDMS (0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and higher than that of AgNW/PDMS composites with the same amount and random dispersion of AgNW (R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS) (5.37&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Variations in the &#955; of 20 vol% S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites are less than 2% under a deformation of 200% elongation, 50% compression, or 180&#176; bending, which benefits from the large deformation characteristics of S&#8208;AgNW. The heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (0.29&#160;W cm&#8722;2 K&#8722;1) of 20 vol% S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites is &#8776;1.3 times that of the 20 vol% R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites, which reduces the temperature of a full&#8208;stressed central processing unit by 6.8&#160;&#176;C compared to that using the 20 vol% R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites as a thermally conductive material in the central processing unit.

         <title>Augmented Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution by d&#8211;p Orbital Electron Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stimulated by the fantastic &#8220;cocktail effect,&#8221; a versatile 2D high&#8208;entropy metal phosphorus trisulfide platform is developed to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction process, where the adsorption of intermediates can be enhanced due to the elevated d&#8211;p orbital hybridization. The inherent correlation is further confirmed by advanced spectral characterizations and density functional theory analyses within this high&#8208;entropy system.








Abstract
While high&#8208;entropy alloys, high&#8208;entropy oxides, and high&#8208;entropy hydroxides, are advanced as a novel frontier in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, their inherent activity deficiency poses a major challenge. To achieve the unlimited goal to tailor the structure&#8211;activity relationship in multicomponent systems, entropy&#8208;driven composition engineering presents substantial potential, by fabricating high&#8208;entropy anion&#8208;regulated transition metal compounds as sophisticated oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. Herein, a versatile 2D high&#8208;entropy metal phosphorus trisulfide is developed as a promising and adjustable platform. Leveraging the multiple electron couplings and d&#8211;p orbital hybridizations induced by the cocktail effect, the exceptional oxygen evolution catalytic activity is disclosed upon van der Waals material (MnFeCoNiZn)PS3, exhibiting an impressively low overpotential of 240&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a minimal Tafel slope of 32&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, and negligible degradation under varying current densities for over 96 h. Density functional theory calculations further offer insights into the correlation between orbital hybridization and catalytic performance within high&#8208;entropy systems, underscoring the contribution of active phosphorus centers on the substrate to performance enhancements. Moreover, by achieving electron redistribution to optimize the electron coordination environment, this work presents an effective strategy for advanced catalysts in energy&#8208;related applications.

&lt;p&gt;Stimulated by the fantastic &#8220;cocktail effect,&#8221; a versatile 2D high-entropy metal phosphorus trisulfide platform is developed to accelerate oxygen evolution reaction process, where the adsorption of intermediates can be enhanced due to the elevated d&#8211;p orbital hybridization. The inherent correlation is further confirmed by advanced spectral characterizations and density functional theory analyses within this high-entropy system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While high-entropy alloys, high-entropy oxides, and high-entropy hydroxides, are advanced as a novel frontier in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution, their inherent activity deficiency poses a major challenge. To achieve the unlimited goal to tailor the structure&#8211;activity relationship in multicomponent systems, entropy-driven composition engineering presents substantial potential, by fabricating high-entropy anion-regulated transition metal compounds as sophisticated oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts. Herein, a versatile 2D high-entropy metal phosphorus trisulfide is developed as a promising and adjustable platform. Leveraging the multiple electron couplings and d&#8211;p orbital hybridizations induced by the cocktail effect, the exceptional oxygen evolution catalytic activity is disclosed upon van der Waals material (MnFeCoNiZn)PS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibiting an impressively low overpotential of 240&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a minimal Tafel slope of 32&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and negligible degradation under varying current densities for over 96 h. Density functional theory calculations further offer insights into the correlation between orbital hybridization and catalytic performance within high-entropy systems, underscoring the contribution of active phosphorus centers on the substrate to performance enhancements. Moreover, by achieving electron redistribution to optimize the electron coordination environment, this work presents an effective strategy for advanced catalysts in energy-related applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Half&#8208;metallization Atom&#8208;Fingerprints Achieved at Ultrafast Oxygen&#8208;Evaporated Pyrochlores for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology is proposed in the high&#8208;entropy Bi1Pb0.5Y0.5Ir1.5Sn0.5O7 pyrochlores to realize a controllable half&#8208;metallization atom&#8208;fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, in which the coexistence of metallic bonds and covalent bonds can reconfigure the spin electron occupation. This spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state facilitates the spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interaction between catalysts and intermediates, leading to spin&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics.








Abstract
The stability and catalytic activity of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are strongly determined by the coordination states and spatial symmetry among metal sites at catalysts. Herein, an ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology to rapidly soften the intrinsic covalent bonds using ultrahigh electrical pulses is suggested, in which prospective charged excited states at this extreme avalanche condition can generate a strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling to rapidly evaporate some coordinated oxygen (O) atoms, finally leading to a controllable half&#8208;metallization feature. Simultaneously, the relative metal (M) site arrays can be orderly locked to delineate some intriguing atom&#8208;fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, where the coexistence of metallic bonds (M&#9472;M) and covalent bonds (M&#9472;O) at this symmetry&#8208;breaking configuration can partially restrain crystal field effect to generate a particular high&#8208;spin occupied state. This half&#8208;metallization catalyst can effectively optimize the spin&#8208;related reaction kinetics in acidic OER, giving rise to 10.3 times (at 188&#160;mV overpotential) reactive activity than pristine pyrochlores. This work provides a new understanding of half&#8208;metallization atom&#8208;fingerprints at catalyst surfaces to accelerate acidic water oxidation.

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly porous 3D framework with abundant sodiophilic active sites can effectively uniform electric field distribution and reduce nucleation energy barriers. The synergistic interaction between the optimized interfacial solvation structure and the robust NaF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface layer contributes to a dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode, significantly prolonging the lifespan of sodium metal batteries.








Abstract
3D substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component is regulated and detrimental side reactions are restrained through the uniform loading of Na&#8211;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8211;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 h with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

         <title>Unraveling the Solution Aggregation Structures and Processing Resiliency of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaic Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temperature&#8208;dependent solution aggregation behavior of high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic blends is thoroughly investigated by complementary scattering techniques. The direct quantitative relationships established between multiscale solution structural parameters (Kuhn length of polymer aggregates, L1, and the percentage of acceptors distributed within polymer aggregates, &#1060;) and device performance provide valuable optimization guidelines for the preparation of high&#8208;performance organic electronic devices.








Abstract
The solution aggregation structure of conjugated polymers is crucial to the morphology and resultant optoelectronic properties of organic electronics and is of considerable interest in the field. Precise characterizations of the solution aggregation structures of organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends and their temperature&#8208;dependent variations remain challenging. In this work, the temperature&#8208;dependent solution aggregation structures of three representative high&#8208;efficiency OPV blends using small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray/neutron scattering are systematically probed. Three cases of solution processing resiliency are elucidated in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPV blends. The exceptional processing resiliency of high&#8208;efficiency PBQx&#8208;TF blends can be attributed to the minimal changes in the multiscale solution aggregation structure at elevated temperatures. Importantly, a new parameter, the percentage of acceptors distributed within polymer aggregates (&#1060;), for the first time in OPV blend solution, establishes a direct correlation between &#1060; and performance is quantified. The device performance is well correlated with the Kuhn length of the cylinder related to polymer aggregates L1 at the small scale and the &#1060; at the large scale. Optimal device performance is achieved with L1 at &#8776;30&#160;nm and &#1060; within the range of 60&#160;&#177;&#160;5%. This study represents a significant advancement in the aggregation structure research of organic electronics.

         <title>Conductive Zeolite Supported Indium&#8211;Tin Alloy Nanoclusters for Selective and Scalable Formic Acid Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative electrically conductive zeolite is designed as a favorable electrocatalytic support, which impregnates ultrasmall In0.2Sn0.8 alloy nanoclusters into the supercages of 12&#8208;ring framework with tunable electronic and geometric metal&#8211;support interactions, achieving industrial&#8208;level formic acid electrosynthesis from CO2 electrolysis and opening a new era of zeolites in applications of electrocatalysis and energy conversion.








Abstract
Upgrading excess CO2 toward the electrosynthesis of formic acid is of significant research and commercial interest. However, simultaneously achieving high selectivity and industrially relevant current densities of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion remains a grand challenge for practical implementations. Here, an electrically conductive zeolite support is strategically designed by implanting Sn ions into the skeleton structure of a zeolite Y, which impregnates ultrasmall In0.2Sn0.8 alloy nanoclusters into the supercages of the tailored 12&#8208;ring framework. The prominent electronic and geometric interactions between In0.2Sn0.8 nanoalloy and zeolite support lead to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between In active site and *OCHO intermediate. Thus, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *OCHO formation step is reduced, facilitating the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to formic acid. Accordingly, the developed zeolite electrocatalyst achieves an industrial&#8208;level partial current density of 322&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 98.2% for formate production and stably maintains Faradaic efficiency above 93% at an industrially relevant current density for over 102 h. This work opens up new opportunities of conductive zeolite&#8208;based electrocatalysts for industrial&#8208;level formic acid electrosynthesis from CO2 electrolysis and toward practically accessible electrocatalysis and energy conversion.

Here, an electrically conductive zeolite support is strategically designed by implanting Sn ions into the skeleton structure of a zeolite Y, which impregnates ultrasmall In&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt; alloy nanoclusters into the supercages of the tailored 12-ring framework. The prominent electronic and geometric interactions between In&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt; nanoalloy and zeolite support lead to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between In active site and *OCHO intermediate. Thus, the energy barrier for the rate-limiting *OCHO formation step is reduced, facilitating the electrocatalytic hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to formic acid. Accordingly, the developed zeolite electrocatalyst achieves an industrial-level partial current density of 322&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 98.2% for formate production and stably maintains Faradaic efficiency above 93% at an industrially relevant current density for over 102 h. This work opens up new opportunities of conductive zeolite-based electrocatalysts for industrial-level formic acid electrosynthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolysis and toward practically accessible electrocatalysis and energy conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supported IrO2 Nanocatalyst with Multilayered Structure for Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a supported IrO2 nanocatalyst with a tri&#8208;layered structure, dubbed IrO2@TaOx@TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO2 nanoparticles anchored on TaOx overlayer of TaB nanorods, is reported. The IrO2@TaOx@TaB can be used to fabricate a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading anode catalyst layer while maintaining excellent activity and stability in a proton exchange membrane electrolyzer.








Abstract
The design of a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading anode catalyst layer with high activity and durability is a key challenge for a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, the synthesis of a novel supported IrO2 nanocatalyst with a tri&#8208;layered structure, dubbed IrO2@TaOx@TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO2 nanoparticles anchored on amorphous TaOx overlayer of TaB nanorods is reported. The composite electrocatalyst shows great activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, thanks to its dual&#8208;interface structural feature. The electronic interaction in IrO2/TaOx interface can regulate the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, the Ir3+/ Ir4+ ratio, and the redox peak potential of IrO2 for enhancing OER activity, while the dense TaOx overlayer can prevent further oxidation of TaB substrate and stabilize the IrO2 catalytic layers for improving structural stability during OER. The IrO2@TaOx@TaB can be used to fabricate an anode catalyst layer of PEMWE with an iridium&#8208;loading as low as 0.26&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2. The low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading PEMWE delivers high current densities at low cell voltages (e.g., 3.9&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2@2.0 V), and gives excellent activity retention for more than 1500&#160;h at 2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 current density.

         <title>Bifunctional Oxygen&#8208;Defect Bismuth Catalyst toward Concerted Production of H2O2 with over 150% Cell Faradaic Efficiency in Continuously Flowing Paired&#8208;Electrosynthesis System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional oxygen&#8208;defect bismuth catalyst, obtained through the in situ electrochemical reconstruction of Bi&#8208;MOF nanorods, is applied as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for both anodic water oxidation reaction and cathodic oxygen reduction reaction, which is capable of promoting a novel continuously flowing paired&#8208;electrosynthesis system for large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;effective production of H2O2 with over 150% cell Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from O2 or H2O via the two&#8208;electron (2e&#8722;) oxygen reduction (2e&#8722; ORR) or water oxidation (2e&#8722; WOR) reaction provides a green and sustainable alternative to the traditional anthraquinone process. Herein, a paired&#8208;electrosynthesis tactic is reported for concerted H2O2 production at a high rate by coupling the 2e&#8722; ORR and 2e&#8722; WOR, in which the bifunctional oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched Bi2O3 nanorods (Ov&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;EO), obtained through electrochemically oxidative reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Bi&#8208;MOF) nanorod precursor, are used as both efficient anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, achieving concurrent H2O2 production at both electrodes with high Faradaic efficiencies. Specifically, the coupled 2e&#8722; ORR//2e&#8722; WOR electrolysis system based on such distinctive oxygen&#8208;defect Bi catalyst displays excellent performance for the paired&#8208;electrosynthesis of H2O2, delivering a remarkable cell Faradaic efficiency of 154.8% and an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.3 mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Experiments combined with theoretical analysis reveal the crucial role of oxygen vacancies in optimizing the adsorption of intermediates associated with the selective two&#8208;electron reaction pathways, thereby improving the activity and selectivity of the 2e&#8722; reaction processes at both electrodes. This work establishes a new paradigm for developing advanced electrocatalysts and designing novel paired&#8208;electrolysis systems for scalable and sustainable H2O2 electrosynthesis.

Self&#8208;Reinforced MOF&#8208;Based Nanogel
In article number 2401094, Mingzhu Zhang, Huiyu Liu, Qi Gu, and co&#8208;workers report a long&#8208;acting nanogel as a drug carrier based on MOFs, KZIF@HA. This nanogel responds to the inflammatory microenvironment of osteoarthritis, enabling the sustained release of kartogenin and Zn2+ over an extended period. Moreover, KZIF@HA significantly enhances the synthesis of extracellular matrix and the polarization of M2 macrophages. It also inhibits JNK and ERK signaling pathways, thereby achieving a multifaceted regulation of the pathological environment associated with osteoarthritis.

Size&#8208;Selective Nanopores
The reconfigurable MechanoPore, built from DNA origami, is a nanopore with tunable lumen sizes. It can switch between 3 distinct states (open, intermediate, closed), after incorporation into a lipid membrane, enabling the controlled influx or exclusion of differently&#8208;sized cargo. More details can be found in article number 2405104 by Amelie Heuer&#8208;Jungemann, Sabina Caneva, and co&#8208;workers.

PiGF@Diamond Color Converter
In article number 2406147, Yang Peng, Daqin Chen, and co&#8208;workers report a novel color converting architecture of phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;glass film on transparent diamond (PiGF@diamond). Thermal conductivity of the PiGF@diamond reaches a record value of 599.3 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, making it bear the laser power density up to 40.24 W mm&#8722;2 and a maximum luminous flux of 5602 lm without luminescence saturation. This enables its promising application in high&#8208;color rendering laser&#8208;driven projection display.

Superatomic Layer
In article number 2404249, Yusuke Nakanishi, Zheng Liu, and colleagues introduce the discovery of a molecular 2D material &#8216;superatomic layer&#8217; consisting of nanoscale cubes. Unlike conventional atomic layers e.g. graphene, this 2D material is composed of cubic Mo4S4 clusters called &#8216;superatoms&#8217; connected by chlorine. It shows significant potential as a hydrogen production catalyst.

SIBs/PIBs are regarded as highly promising candidates to LIBs in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to low cost. To rationalize the SIBs/PIBs technologies as alternatives to LIBs from the unit energy cost perspective, this review gives the specific criteria for their energy density at possible electrode&#8208;price grades and battery&#8208;longevity levels, and provides the correct development direction of energy&#8208;storage technologies.








Abstract
Cost&#8208;effectiveness plays a decisive role in sustainable operating of rechargeable batteries. As such, the low cost&#8208;consumption of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) provides a promising direction for &#8220;how do SIBs/PIBs replace Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) counterparts&#8221; based on their resource abundance and advanced electrochemical performance. To rationalize the SIBs/PIBs technologies as alternatives to LIBs from the unit energy cost perspective, this review gives the specific criteria for their energy density at possible electrode&#8208;price grades and various battery&#8208;longevity levels. The cost ($ kWh&#8722;1 cycle&#8722;1) advantage of SIBs/PIBs is ascertained by the cheap raw&#8208;material compensation for the cycle performance deficiency and the energy density gap with LIBs. Furthermore, the cost comparison between SIBs and PIBs, especially on cost per kWh and per cycle, is also involved. This review explicitly manifests the practicability and cost&#8208;effectiveness toward SIBs are superior to PIBs whose commercialization has so far been hindered by low energy density. Even so, the huge potential on sustainability of PIBs, to outperform SIBs, as the mainstream energy storage technology is revealed as long as PIBs achieve long cycle life or enhanced energy density, the related outlook of which is proceeded as the next development directions for commercial applications.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 39, September 26, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the latest advancements in the development of organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid manganese(II) halides as efficient light&#8208;emitting materials, which covers from their fundamental physicochemical properties to advanced optoelectronic applications, with an emphasis on the structural and functionality design especially for light&#8208;emitting diodes and X&#8208;ray scintillators. Current challenges and future efforts toward this active research field are envisioned.








Abstract
Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid manganese(II) halides (OIMnHs) have garnered tremendous interest across a wide array of research fields owing to their outstanding optical properties, abundant structural diversity, low&#8208;cost solution processibility, and low toxicity, which make them extremely suitable for use as a new class of luminescent materials for various optoelectronic applications. Over the past years, a plethora of OIMnHs with different structural dimensionalities and multifunctionalities such as efficient photoluminescence (PL), radioluminescence, circularly polarized luminescence, and mechanoluminescence have been newly created by judicious screening of the organic cations and inorganic Mn(II) polyhedra. Specifically, through precise molecular and structural engineering, a series of OIMnHs with near&#8208;unity PL quantum yields, high anti&#8208;thermal quenching properties, and excellent stability in harsh conditions have been devised and explored for applications in light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), X&#8208;ray scintillators, multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and fluorescent sensing. In this review, the latest advancements in the development of OIMnHs as efficient light&#8208;emitting materials are summarized, which&#160;covers from their fundamental physicochemical properties to advanced optoelectronic applications, with an emphasis on the structural and functionality design especially for LEDs and X&#8208;ray detection and imaging. Current challenges and future efforts to unlock the potentials of these promising materials are also envisioned.

         <title>A Peptide&#8208;Drug Conjugate&#8208;Based Nanoplatform for Immunometabolic Activation and In Situ Nerve Regeneration in Advanced&#8208;Stage Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;drug conjugate&#8208;based nanoplatform is designed to deliver hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to microglia and astrocytes, respectively. The critical immune&#8208;metabolic pathway in microglia is significantly activated to reverse the immune tolerance. Astrocytes are in situ trans&#8208;differentiated into functional neurons. This nanoplatform significantly inhibits the progression of advanced&#8208;stage Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease (AD).








Abstract
The formidable protection of physiological barriers and unclear pathogenic mechanisms impede drug development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As defenders of the central nervous system, immune&#8208;metabolism function, and stemness of glial cells remain dormant during degeneration, representing a significant challenge for simultaneously targeting and modulating. Here, a modular nanoplatform is presented composed of peptide&#8208;drug conjugates and an inflammation&#8208;responsive core. The nanoplatform is transported through the blood&#8208;brain barrier via transcytosis and disassembles in the oxidative stress microenvironment upon intravenous administration. The released drug&#8208;conjugated modules can specifically target and deliver hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to microglia and astrocytes, respectively. The immune function of chronic tolerant microglia is activated by metabolic modulation, and reactive astrocytes trans&#8208;differentiate into functional neurons. In a transgenic mouse model, nanoplatform reduces levels of toxic proteins and inflammation while increasing neuronal density. This results in the amelioration of learning and memory decline. The modular nanoplatform provides design principles for multi&#8208;cellular targeting and combination nano&#8208;therapy for inflammation&#8208;related diseases.

Abstract
In this review, the recent development of blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLED) are summarized. On deep&#8208;blue (&#8804;465&#160;nm) perovskite nanomaterials of different structural forms are mainly focused, including nanocrystals (NCs), quantum dots (QDs), nanoplatelets (NPLs), quasi&#8208;2D thin film, 3D bulk thin film, as well as lead&#8208;free perovskite nanomaterials. The current challenges are also examined in producing efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLED, such as material and spectral instability, imbalance charge transport, Joule heat impact, and poor optoelectronic performance. Several strategies are further discussed to overcome these challenges and achieve efficient deep&#8208;blue PeLED for next&#8208;generation display technology.

         <title>Hydroxyl&#8208;Functionalized Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity and Dual&#8208;Functionalized Blends for High&#8208;Performance Membrane&#8208;Based Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance OH&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208; and Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;derived&#160;PIMs and a series of dual&#8208;functionalized PIM&#8208;PI blends containing both hydroxyl&#8208; and carboxyl functional groups are demonstrated for membrane&#8208;based gas separations. Physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding of functionalized PIMs and PIM&#8208;PI blends forms tight polymer networks, providing an efficient strategy for developing plasticization resistant, robust, and highly&#8208;selective PIM&#8208;based membrane materials.








Abstract
Membrane technology has shown significant growth during the past two decades in the gas separation industry due to its energy&#8208;savings, compact and modular design, continuous operation, and environmentally benign nature. Robust materials with higher permeability and selectivity are key to reduce capital and operational cost, pushing it forward to replace or debottleneck conventional energy&#8208;intensive unit operations such as distillation. Recently designed ladder polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) and polyimides of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;PI) with pores &lt;20 &#197; have demonstrated excellent gas permeation performance. Here, a series of plasticization&#8208;resistant PIM&#8208;based membrane materials is reported, including the first example of a hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized triptycene&#8208; and Tr&#246;ger's base&#8208;derived ladder PIM and two PIM&#8208;PI homopolymers and a series of dual&#8208;functionalized polyimide blends containing hydroxyl&#8208; and carboxyl&#8208;functionalized groups. Specifically, 4,4&#8242;&#8208;(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic anhydride (6FDA)&#8208;based PIM&#8208;PI blends demonstrated extremely high selectivity for a variety of industrially important applications. An optimized polyimide blend containing &#9472;OH and &#9472;COOH groups showed permselectivity values of 136 for CO2/CH4, 11.4 for O2/N2 and 636 for H2/CH4. Such extreme size&#8208;sieving capabilities are attributed to physical crosslinking induced by strong hydrogen bonding forming tightly structured polymer networks. The study provides a new general strategy for developing plasticization resistant, robust, and highly&#8208;selective PIM&#8208;based membrane materials.

         <title>Tunable Interlayer Interactions in Exfoliated 2D van der Waals Framework Fe(SCN)2(Pyrazine)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Partial oxidation of 2D van der Waals frameworks causes their aggregation in solution, while remaining colloidally stable. Strong inter&#8208;sheet non&#8208;covalent interactions give rise to intense, broad&#8208;band visible light absorption. The absorption intensity, bandshape, and energy of this inter&#8208;sheet absorption band is highly tunable by controlling solvent and framework identity.








Abstract
2D materials can be isolated as monolayer sheets when interlayer interactions involve weak van der Waals forces. These atomically thin structures enable novel topological physics and open chemical questions of how to tune the structure and properties of the sheets while maintaining them as isolated monolayers. Here, this work investigates 2D electroactive sheets that exfoliate in solution into colloidal nanosheets, but aggregate upon oxidation, giving rise to tunable interlayer charge transfer absorption and photoluminescence. This optical behavior resembles interlayer excitons, now intensely studied due to their long&#8208;lived emission, but which remain difficult to tune through synthetic chemistry. Instead, the interlayer excitons of these framework sheets can be modulated through control of solvent, electrolyte, oxidation state, and the composition of the framework building blocks. Compared to other 2D materials, these framework sheets display the largest known interlayer binding strengths, attributable to specific orbital interactions between the sheets, and among the longest interlayer exciton lifetimes. Taken together, this study provides a microscopic basis for manipulating long&#8208;range opto&#8208;electronic behavior in van der Waals materials through molecular synthetic chemistry.

         <title>Toward a Radically Simple Multi&#8208;Modal Nasal Spray for Preventing Respiratory Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pathogen capture and neutralizing spray (PCANS) is reported to prevent respiratory infections through a multi&#8208;modal approach. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets and serving as a physical barrier against viruses and bacteria, while neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. In mice, PCANS shows nasal retention for &#8776;8 hours and offers pre&#8208;exposure protection against lethal viral infections.








Abstract
Nasal sprays for pre&#8208;exposure prophylaxis against respiratory infections show limited protection (20&#8211;70%), largely due to their single mechanism of action&#8212;either neutralizing pathogens or blocking their entry at the nasal lining, and a failure to maximize the capture of respiratory droplets, allowing them to potentially rebound and reach deeper airways. This report introduces the Pathogen Capture and Neutralizing Spray (PCANS), which utilizes a multi&#8208;modal approach to enhance efficacy. PCANS coats the nasal cavity, capturing large respiratory droplets from the air, and serving as a physical barrier against a broad spectrum of viruses and bacteria, while rapidly neutralizing them with over 99.99% effectiveness. The formulation consists of excipients identified from the FDA's Inactive Ingredient Database and Generally Recognized as Safe list to maximize efficacy for each step in the multi&#8208;modal approach. PCANS demonstrates nasal retention for up to 8 hours in mice. In a severe Influenza A mouse model, a single pre&#8208;exposure dose of PCANS leads to a &gt;99.99% reduction in lung viral titer and ensures 100% survival, compared to 0% in the control group. PCANS suppresses pathological manifestations and offers protection for at least 4 hours. This data suggest PCANS as a promising daily&#8208;use prophylactic against respiratory infections.

         <title>Iridium Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;Ensembles Stabilized on Mn&#8208;Substituted Spinel Oxide for Durable Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The limited stability of single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalyst and Ir/Ru&#8208;based oxides in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a long&#8208;standing issue. Herein, an innovative strategy is presented to fabricate short&#8208;range Ir single&#8208;atom&#8208;ensembles on Mn&#8208;substituted spinel Co3O4, which effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, demonstrating excellent activity and stability for acidic OER.








Abstract
Exploring single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of paramount importance for cost&#8208;effective hydrogen production via acidic water electrolyzers. However, the limited durability of most single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts and Ir/Ru&#8208;based oxides under harsh acidic OER conditions, primarily attributed to excessive lattice oxygen participation resulting in metal&#8208;leaching and structural collapse, hinders their practical application. Herein, an innovative strategy is developed to fabricate short&#8208;range Ir single&#8208;atom&#8208;ensembles (IrSAE) stabilized on the surface of Mn&#8208;substituted spinel Co3O4 (IrSAE&#8208;CMO), which exhibits excellent mass activity and significantly improved durability (degradation&#8208;rate: &#8776;2&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1), outperforming benchmark IrO2 (&#8776;44&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1) and conventional Irsingle&#8208;atoms on pristine&#8208;Co3O4 for acidic OER. First&#8208;principle calculations reveal that Mn&#8208;substitution in the octahedral sites of Co3O4 substantially reduces the migration energy barrier for Irsingle&#8208;atoms on the CMO surface compared to pristine&#8208;Co3O4, facilitating the migration of Irsingle&#8208;atoms to form strongly correlated IrSAE during pyrolysis. Extensive ex situ characterization, operando X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman spectroscopies, pH&#8208;dependence activity tests, and theoretical calculations indicate that the rigid IrSAE with appropriate Ir&#8211;Ir distance stabilized on the CMO surface effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, thereby mitigating Ir&#8208;dissolution and structural collapse, boosting the stability in an acidic environment.

Herein, an innovative strategy is presented to fabricate short-range Ir single-atom-ensembles on Mn-substituted spinel Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which effectively suppresses lattice oxygen participation while promoting direct O&#9472;O radical coupling, demonstrating excellent activity and stability for acidic OER.

         <title>Advances and Challenges in Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review covers the key fabrication techniques for large&#8208;area perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs), including spin coating, blade coating, inkjet printing, and vacuum thermal evaporation. The pros and cons of each method are discussed in detail, along with the latest advances in large&#8208;area PeLEDs development. Specific challenges are discussed and potential improvement strategies are proposed, all of which are crucial for scalable PeLEDs production. The goal of this review is to offer guidelines for overcoming the challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area devices.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have shown promise for high&#8208;definition displays and flat&#8208;panel lighting because of their wide color gamut, narrow emission band, and high brightness. The external quantum efficiency of PeLEDs increased rapidly from &#8776;1% to more than 25% in the past few years. However, most of these high&#8208;performance devices are fabricated using a spin coating method with a small device area of &lt;0.1 cm2, limiting their commercial applications. Recently, large&#8208;area PeLEDs have attracted growing attention and significant breakthroughs have been reported. This perspective first introduces the pros and cons of each technique in making large&#8208;area PeLEDs. The advances in the fabrication of large&#8208;area PeLEDs are then summarized using spin coating and mass&#8208;production methods such as inkjet printing, blade coating, and thermal evaporation. Moreover, the challenging issues will be discussed that are urgent to be solved for large&#8208;area PeLEDs.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Semiconductor Device Enabling Optoelectronic Detection and Neuromorphic Processing with Extended Spectral Responsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;mode device is developed using a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction with an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer, enabling both optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, it achieves ultra&#8208;wide spectral response and reproduces high&#8208;quality 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixel images. In mode 2, it acts as a neuromorphic device, achieving 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance semiconductor devices capable of multiple functions are pivotal in meeting the challenges of miniaturization and integration in advanced technologies. Despite the inherent difficulties of incorporating dual functionality within a single device, a high&#8208;performance, dual&#8208;mode device is reported. This device integrates an ultra&#8208;thin Al2O3 passivation layer with a PbS/Si hybrid heterojunction, which can simultaneously enable optoelectronic detection and neuromorphic operation. In mode 1, the device efficiently separates photo&#8208;generated electron&#8208;hole pairs, exhibiting an ultra&#8208;wide spectral response from ultraviolet (265&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1650&#160;nm) wavelengths. It also reproduces high&#8208;quality images of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, achieving a Q&#8208;value as low as 0.00437&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a light intensity of 8.58&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Meanwhile, when in mode 2, the as&#8208;assembled device with typical persistent photoconductivity (PPC) behavior can act as a neuromorphic device, which can achieve 96.5% accuracy in classifying standard digits underscoring its efficacy in temporal information processing. It is believed that the present dual&#8208;function devices potentially advance the multifunctionality and miniaturization of chips for intelligence applications.

         <title>Enhanced Intramolecular Hole Transfer in Block Copolymer Enables &gt;15% and Operational Stable Single&#8208;Material&#8211;Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The impact of different synthetic protocols of block copolymer (BCP) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. The more phase pure direct synthesis BCP exhibits enhanced intramolecular hole transfer, leading to a record efficiency of over 15% for single&#8208;material&#8211;organic solar cells together with excellent long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Recent studies on narrow bandgap all&#8208;conjugated block copolymer (BCP) single&#8208;material&#8211;organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have made unprecedented progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE); however, it still lacks understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship in these highly mixed materials. Herein, the impact of different synthetic protocols (direct synthesis (d&#8208;BCP) versus sequential synthesis (s&#8208;BCP)) is first investigated on the relevant photovoltaic properties. Targeting the same BCP, namely PBDB&#8208;T&#8208;b&#8208;PYIT, it is found that the change in polymerization reaction leads to quite different optical and transport properties. The d&#8208;BCP outputs a record&#8208;high PCE of 15.02% for SMOSCs as well as enhanced operation stability under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which is significantly higher than that of s&#8208;BCP (10.33%) and even close to its bulk heterojunction (BHJ) counterparts. Detailed transient absorption spectroscopy reveals ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer (CT) and exciton dissociation in BCP. In together with morphology characterization, it is revealed that the d&#8208;BCP has more phase pure composition, enhanced molecular ordering, and higher intramolecular CT efficiency relative to those of s&#8208;BCP. These findings gain insight into both the structure and carrier dynamic of BCP and demonstrate the possibility of achieving high&#8208;efficiency and stable SMOSCs.

         <title>Twist&#8208;Controlled Ferroelectricity and Emergent Multiferroicity in WSe2 Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The twisted tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers stacked along with monolayer graphene exhibit noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &#952; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale&#8208;controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist&#8208;controlled commensurate to non&#8208;commensurate transitions. Also, 3&#176; twisted WSe2 exhibits ferroelectric and correlation&#8208;driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist&#8208;controlled multiferroic behavior.








Abstract
Recently, researchers have been investigating artificial ferroelectricity, which arises when inversion symmetry is broken in certain R&#8208;stacked, i.e., zero&#8208;degree twisted, van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. Here, the study reports the twist&#8208;controlled ferroelectricity in tungsten diselenide (WSe2) bilayers. The findings show noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &#952; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale&#8208;controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &lt; &#952; &lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist&#8208;controlled commensurate to non&#8208;commensurate transitions. This twist&#8208;controlled ferroelectricity serves as a spectroscopic tool for detecting transitions between commensurate and incommensurate moir&#233; patterns. At 5.5 K, 3&#176; twisted WSe2 exhibits ferroelectric and correlation&#8208;driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist&#8208;controlled multiferroic behavior.

&lt;p&gt;The twisted tungsten diselenide (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) bilayers stacked along with monolayer graphene exhibit noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale-controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist-controlled commensurate to non-commensurate transitions. Also, 3&#176; twisted WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits ferroelectric and correlation-driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist-controlled multiferroic behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, researchers have been investigating artificial ferroelectricity, which arises when inversion symmetry is broken in certain R-stacked, i.e., zero-degree twisted, van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. Here, the study reports the twist-controlled ferroelectricity in tungsten diselenide (WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) bilayers. The findings show noticeable room temperature ferroelectricity that decreases with twist angle within the range 0&#176; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 3&#176;, and disappears completely for &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &#8805; 4&#176;. This variation aligns with moir&#233; length scale-controlled ferroelectric dynamics (0&#176; &amp;lt; &lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 3&#176;), while loss beyond 4&#176; may relate to twist-controlled commensurate to non-commensurate transitions. This twist-controlled ferroelectricity serves as a spectroscopic tool for detecting transitions between commensurate and incommensurate moir&#233; patterns. At 5.5 K, 3&#176; twisted WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits ferroelectric and correlation-driven ferromagnetic ordering, indicating twist-controlled multiferroic behavior. The study offers insights into twist-controlled coexisting ferro-ordering and serves as valuable spectroscopic tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mimicking Antiferroelectrics with Ferroelectric Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antiferroelectrics are promising materials for applications in energy storage, solid&#8208;state cooling, and negative&#8208;capacitance devices. This study demonstrates that antiferroelectric&#8208;like behavior can be electrostatically engineered in ferroelectric superlattices. An electric field induces a reversible transition from a stable in&#8208;plane polarized state to a state with in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric oxides are promising materials for applications in high&#8208;density energy storage, solid&#8208;state cooling, and negative capacitance devices. However, the range of oxide antiferroelectrics available today is rather limited. In this work, it is demonstrated that antiferroelectric properties can be electrostatically engineered in artificially layered ferroelectric superlattices. Using a combination of synchrotron X&#8208;ray nanodiffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, macroscopic electrical measurements, and lateral and vertical piezoresponse force microscopy in parallel&#8208;plate capacitor geometry, a highly reversible field&#8208;induced transition is observed from a stable in&#8208;plane polarized state to a state with in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized nanodomains that mimics, at the domain level, the nonpolar to polar transition of traditional antiferroelectrics, with corresponding polarization&#8208;voltage double hysteresis and comparable energy storage capacity. Furthermore, it is found that such superlattices exhibit large out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dielectric responses without involving flux&#8208;closure domain dynamics. These results demonstrate that electrostatic and strain engineering in artificially layered materials offers a promising route for the creation of synthetic antiferroelectrics.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Free Gelation of Graphene Oxide Dispersions via Mild Thermal Annealing: Implications for 3D Printing and Supercapacitor Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mild thermal annealing (MTA) process transforms graphene oxide (GO) into an additive&#8208;free gel, significantly enhancing its rheological properties. SAXS experiments reveal the microstructural changes during MTA. The graphitic domains developed through MTA promote hydrophobic attractions, inducing a network structure. Through 3D&#8208;printing and electrochemical experiments, MTA demonstrates potential as an optimal gelation method for GO.








Abstract
Herein, a mild thermal annealing (MTA) process is presented for additive&#8208;free gelation of graphene oxide (GO) dispersions. This process transitions the GO from a nematic liquid crystal phase to a random network structure, significantly enhancing its rheological properties by order of magnitude. This transition is facilitated by the diffusion of functional groups on the GO surface, which induces hydrophobic attractions, leading to a stable network structure. Employing rheo&#8208;SAXS experiments, detailed insights are provided into the microstructural changes of GO gel under shear stress, establishing a direct correlation between its rheological behavior and microstructure. The distinctive properties of MTA&#8208;processed inks are illustrated, seamlessly integrating with 3D printing, to yield a highly porous lattice structure that demonstrates promising potential as a supercapacitor electrode. The MTA process, an additive&#8208;free approach to gelation, maintains the inherent dispersion properties of GO while offering scalability. Thus, this method brings significant economic and environmental advantages compared to conventional gelation techniques. The findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of 2D colloidal network gels but also increase the potential of GO for a wide range of applications, from gas and liquid absorbers to electrodes for energy storage and conversion, and biomedical fields.

         <title>Hybrid Anapole Induced Chirality in Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the design of an asymmetric H&#8208;shaped metasurface that induces hybrid anapole (HA) for achieving chiro&#8208;optical responses. By breaking the structural symmetry, the metasurface supports both first&#8208;order and pseudo higher&#8208;order HA, leading to enhanced circular dichroism and polarization control. These results provide valuable insights into the fundamental study of anapole physics and have significant implications for nanophotonics applications.








Abstract
The interaction between light and matter, particularly chirality, plays a pivotal role in modern science and technology. Typically, metasurfaces achieve chiro&#8208;optical effects by coupling electric and magnetic dipoles in specific orientations. In this work, the design and optimization of an asymmetric H&#8208;shaped metasurface is explored to induce hybrid anapole (HA) for optical activity. When the symmetry of the metasurface structure is disrupted, the design can simultaneously excite first&#8208;order and pseudo high&#8208;order HA under illumination with a specific circular polarization, both occurring within the same spectral regime. This results in high reflection for one circular polarization and a significant reduction in reflection for the orthogonal polarization, thereby exhibiting exceptional chiro&#8208;optical activity. Moreover, the HA&#8208;based chiral metasurface demonstrates strong polarization control capabilities, as verified by Stokes parameter analysis, revealing high birefringence and a pronounced dependence on the incident polarization angle. These results provide valuable insights for the design and optimization of HA metasurfaces for advanced optical applications and polarization control, paving the way for new developments in chiral nanophotonics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graph theory&#8208;based tools and artificial neural networks are used to estimate the strength of interactions between gold nanoclusters and blood proteins based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. The method is able to predict favorable binding sites utilizing the estimated interactions. The sites are validated with half&#8208;microsecond MD simulations, which demonstrate the stability of the predictions.








Abstract
Hybrid nanostructures between biomolecules and inorganic nanomaterials constitute a largely unexplored field of research, with the potential for novel applications in bioimaging, biosensing, and nanomedicine. Developing such applications relies critically on understanding the dynamical properties of the nano&#8211;bio interface. This work introduces and validates a strategy to predict atom&#8208;scale interactions between water&#8208;soluble gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and a set of blood proteins (albumin, apolipoprotein, immunoglobulin, and fibrinogen). Graph theory and neural networks are utilized to predict the strengths of interactions in AuNC&#8211;protein complexes on a coarse&#8208;grained level, which are then optimized in Monte Carlo&#8208;based structure search and refined to atomic&#8208;scale structures. The training data is based on extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of AuNC&#8211;protein complexes, and the validating MD simulations show the robustness of the predictions. This strategy can be generalized to any complexes of inorganic nanostructures and biomolecules provided that one generates enough data about the interactions, and the bioactive parts of the nanostructure can be coarse&#8208;grained&#160;rationally.

The traditional hole transport material (HTM) PEDOT: PSS is a bottleneck for long&#8208;term stability in Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This work offers an alternative means toward efficient and stable Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs using a new multi&#8208;functional HTM Silole&#8208;COOH, demonstrating 23.2%&#8208;efficient single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs, 25.8%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandems while avoiding the stability concerns associated with PEDOT: PSS.

Despite high theoretical efficiencies and rapid improvements in performance, high&#8208;efficiency &#8776;1.2&#160;eV mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) generally rely on poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT: PSS) as the hole transport layer (HTL); a material that is considered to be a bottleneck for long&#8208;term stability due to its acidity and hygroscopic nature. Seeking to replace PEDOT: PSS with an alternative HTL with improved atmospheric and thermal stability, herein, a silole derivative (Silole&#8208;COOH) tuned with optimal electronic properties and efficient carrier transport by incorporating a carboxyl functional group is designed, which results in an optimal band alignment for hole extraction from Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and robust air and thermal stability. Thin films composed of the Silole&#8208;COOH exhibit superior conductivity and carrier mobility compared to PEDOT: PSS, in addition to reduced nonradiative quasi&#8208;Fermi&#8208;level splitting losses at the HTL/perovskite interface and improved quality of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite. Replacement of PEDOT: PSS with Silole&#8208;COOH leads to 23.2%&#8208;efficient single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs, 25.8%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite tandems, and long operating stability in ambient air.

         <title>A Strategy Involving Microporous Microneedles Integrated with CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Macrophages for Scar Management by Regulating Fibrotic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. The study demonstrates that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.








Abstract
Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) positive fibroblasts play a pivotal role in scar development following skin injury. Heterogeneous vascular endothelial cells (ECs) within scarred areas retain the capacity to drive tissue regeneration and repair. Simultaneously, TREM2 macrophages play a crucial role in the progression and resolution of fibrosis by engaging in mutual regulation with ECs. However, effective strategies to inhibit scar formation through multi&#8208;factor regulation of the scar microenvironment remain a challenge. Here, CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;macrophages (CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms) capable of targeting DPP4+ fibroblasts and modulating ECs subtype within the scar microenvironment are engineered to effectively prevent scarring. Hydrogel microporous microneedles (mMNs) are employed to deliver CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms, which can effectively alleviate scar. Single&#8208;cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) analysis reveals that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms can modify ECs fibrotic phenotype and regulate fibrosis by suppressing the profibrotic gene leucine&#8208;rich&#8208;alpha&#8208;2&#8208;glycoprotein 1 (Lrg1). In vitro experiments further demonstrate that CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms improve the scar microenvironment by phagocytosing DPP4+ fibroblasts and suppressing TGF&#946; secretion. This, in turn, inhibits the phenotypic conversion of LRG1 ECs and provides multifactorial way of alleviating scars. This study uncovers the evidence that mMNs attached to CAR&#8208;TREM2&#8208;Ms may exert vital influences on skin scarring through the regulation of the skin scar microenvironment, providing a promising approach for treating posttraumatic scarring.

         <title>Optimization of Charge Extraction and Interconnecting Layers for Highly Efficient Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells with High Fill Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developshighly efficient perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSC) via the simultaneous optimization of quaternary organic BHJ blend, and reduction of optical and electrical losses of interconnecting layers via self&#8208;assembly monolayer. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record fill factor (FF) of 83.62% of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now.








Abstract
Perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (POTSCs) have garnered significant attention due to their potential for achieving high photovoltaic (PV) performance. However, the reported power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and fill factors (FFs) are still subpar due to the challenges associated with charge extraction in the organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) and significant energy losses in the interconnecting layers (ICLs). Here, a quaternary organic BHJ blend is developed to enhance the charge extraction in the organic subcell, contributing to an increased FF of &#8805;78% under 1 sun illumination and even more under lower illumination intensities. Meanwhile, energy losses in the ICLs are reduced via the incorporation of a self&#8208;assembly monolayer (SAM), (4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), in organic BHJ to form a MoOx/SAM interface and the thorough control of the MoOx thickness to suppress parasitic absorption. The resultant POTSCs achieve a remarkable PCE of 25.56% (certified: 24.65%), with a record FF of 83.62%, which is among the highest PCEs of POTSCs and the highest FF of all types of perovskite&#8208;based tandem solar cells (TSCs) till now. This work proves the optimization of charge extraction and ICLs are effective strategies to promote the performance of POTSCs to surpass other solution&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;based TSCs in the near future.

         <title>A Novel Targeted Microtubules Transformable Nanopeptide System Yields Strong Anti&#8208;Prostate Cancer Effects by Suppressing Nuclear Translocation of Androgen Receptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MTN&#8208;sustained presence in prostate cells is essential for inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by effectively preventing AR nuclear translocation in prostate cancer. Moreover, this provides a groundbreaking approach, delivering long&#8208;term and continuous suppression of PCa with an emphasis on maintaining a high bio&#8208;safety profile.








Abstract
The extended use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may often lead to the progression from castration&#8208;sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC) to castration&#8208;resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in prostate cancer. To address this, it is essential to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR) as part of an effective disease&#8208;modifying strategy. Microtubules play a central role in facilitating AR nuclear translocation, highlighting their importance as a therapeutic target. In this regard, a designated as the targeted microtubules transformable nanopeptide system (MTN) is developed. This system is designed to disrupt microtubule structure and function through dual&#8208;targeting of prostate&#8208;specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and &#946;&#8208;tubulin. Initially, MTN targets prostate cells via PSMA and then specifically binds to &#946;&#8208;tubulin within microtubules, leading to the formation of nanofibers. These nanofibers subsequently induce the polymerization of microtubules, thereby disrupting AR transport. Notably, MTN exhibits efficient and prolonged suppression of prostate cancer across the spectrum from CSPC to CRPC, with a highly favorable safety profile in normal cells. These findings highlight the potential of MTN as a novel and promising approach for comprehensive prostate cancer therapy throughout its entire progression.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Narrow&#8208;Band Deep&#8208;Red Electroluminescence By a Soliton&#8208;type Dye Squaraine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Squaraine dyes typically exhibit narrow emission spectra due to their soliton&#8208;like electronic structure characteristics. An organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on soliton&#8208;type squaraine dye is prepared, overcoming the luminescence quenching induced by dye aggregation. The deep&#8208;red electroluminescence peak is located at 668&#160;nm, with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of only 0.10&#160;eV.








Abstract
Due to the soliton&#8208;like electronic structural characteristics, cyanine dyes typically exhibit spectral behaviors such as large molar extinction coefficients, narrow spectra, and high fluorescence efficiency. However, their extensive applications as emitters in electroluminescence are largely ignored due to their serious emission quenching in the aggregation state. Herein, it is reported a squaraine dye (a type of cyanine) SQPhEt. At different solution concentrations, the unusual decrease in full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima (FWHM) with increasing Stokes shift indicates the fluorescence quenching of SQPhEt in the aggregated state is because of the strong self&#8208;absorption effect. A sensitized device structure can help to reduce the doping concentration of dye, which can effectively suppress self&#8208;absorption. Benefitting from the large molar extinction coefficient of SQPhEt, even at low doping concentrations of 0.1 wt%, efficient F&#246;rster energy transfer can be achieved. The corresponding spin&#8208;coating sensitized device based on SQPhEt as the dopant exhibits favorable deep&#8208;red emission at 668&#160;nm with a small FWHM of 0.10&#160;eV.

&lt;p&gt;Squaraine dyes typically exhibit narrow emission spectra due to their soliton-like electronic structure characteristics. An organic light-emitting diode based on soliton-type squaraine dye is prepared, overcoming the luminescence quenching induced by dye aggregation. The deep-red electroluminescence peak is located at 668&#160;nm, with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of only 0.10&#160;eV.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the soliton-like electronic structural characteristics, cyanine dyes typically exhibit spectral behaviors such as large molar extinction coefficients, narrow spectra, and high fluorescence efficiency. However, their extensive applications as emitters in electroluminescence are largely ignored due to their serious emission quenching in the aggregation state. Herein, it is reported a squaraine dye (a type of cyanine) SQPhEt. At different solution concentrations, the unusual decrease in full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) with increasing Stokes shift indicates the fluorescence quenching of SQPhEt in the aggregated state is because of the strong self-absorption effect. A sensitized device structure can help to reduce the doping concentration of dye, which can effectively suppress self-absorption. Benefitting from the large molar extinction coefficient of SQPhEt, even at low doping concentrations of 0.1 wt%, efficient F&#246;rster energy transfer can be achieved. The corresponding spin-coating sensitized device based on SQPhEt as the dopant exhibits favorable deep-red emission at 668&#160;nm with a small FWHM of 0.10&#160;eV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pyroptotic&#8208;Spatiotemporally Selective Delivery of siRNA against Pyroptosis and Autoimmune Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision delivery and release of siRNA to inflamed tissue and immune cells could unleash its full therapeutic potential in autoimmune diseases. A pyroptotic&#8208;spatiotemporally selective siRNA delivery system (PMRC@siGSDME) selectively targets inflammatory tissues, responds to pyrotosis, and exhibits therapeutic efficacy against various autoimmune diseases.








Abstract
Small&#8208;interfering RNAs (siRNAs) offer promising prospects for treating pyroptosis&#8208;related autoimmune diseases. However, poor stability and off&#8208;target effects during in vivo transportation hinder their practical clinical applications. Precision delivery and adaptive release of siRNAs into inflamed tissues and immune cells could unleash their full therapeutic potential. This study establishes a pyroptotic&#8208;spatiotemporally selective siRNA delivery system (PMRC@siGSDME) that selectively targets inflammatory tissues, responds to pyroptosis, and exhibits remarkable therapeutic efficacy against various autoimmune diseases. Novel hybrid nanovesicles (NVs) are designed as a combination of pyroptotic macrophage membranes (PMs) and R8&#8208;cardiolipin&#8208;containing nanovesicles (RC&#8208;NVs). Evidence provides that PM&#8208;derived proteins involved in cell&#8211;cell interactions and membrane trafficking may contribute to the specificity of NVs to inflammatory tissue. In addition, cardiolipin anchored in the hybrid NVs increases its affinity for activated gasdermin E (GSDME) and achieves pyroptosis&#8208;adaptive release of siGSDME for the spatiotemporally selective suppression of immune responses. More importantly, PMRC@siGSDME displays significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and therapeutic effects in multiple mouse autoimmune disease models, including arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Collectively, an innovative siRNA delivery strategy precisely tailored for pyroptotic cells has been developed, paving the way for new treatments for autoimmune inflammatory diseases with minimal side effects and wide clinical applicability.

         <title>Organic Crystals and Optical Functions in Biology: Knowns and Unknowns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystals composed of organic molecules, mainly purines and pteridines, are produced by organisms to fulfill optical functions. Four levels of organization, molecular, structural, morphological, and superstructural, are examined to understand the optical, chemical, and biological principles of how such crystal assemblies manipulate light. This understanding may provide inspiration for new materials with tailor&#8208;made optical performance.








Abstract
Organic crystals are widely used by animals to manipulate light for producing structural colors and for improving vision. To date only seven crystal types are known to be used, and among them &#946;&#8208;guanine crystals are by far the most widespread. The fact that almost all these crystals have unusually high refractive indices (RIs) is consistent with their light manipulation function. Here, the physical, structural, and optical principles of how light interacts with the polarizable free&#8208;electron&#8208;rich environment of these quasiaromatic molecules are addressed. How the organization of these molecules into crystalline arrays introduces optical anisotropy and finally how organisms control crystal morphology and superstructural organization to optimize functions in light reflection and scattering are also discussed. Many open questions remain in this fascinating field, some of which arise out of this in&#8208;depth analysis of the interaction of light with crystal arrays. More types of organic crystals will probably be discovered, as well as other organisms that use these crystals to manipulate light. The insights gained from biological systems can also be harnessed for improving synthetic light&#8208;manipulating materials.

         <title>Emergence of Interfacial Magnetism in Strongly&#8208;Correlated Nickelate&#8208;Titanate Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superlattice pairing of strongly&#8208;correlated LaNiO3 and LaTiO3 triggers interfacial electron transfer from LaTiO3 to LaNiO3, leading to emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface. The quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensionality of this interface magnetism opens its potential utilizations in spintronic devices, and makes it resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates.








Abstract
Strongly&#8208;correlated transition&#8208;metal oxides are widely known for their various exotic phenomena. This is exemplified by rare&#8208;earth nickelates such as LaNiO3, which possess intimate interconnections between their electronic, spin, and lattice degrees of freedom. Their properties can be further enhanced by pairing them in hybrid heterostructures, which can lead to hidden phases and emergent phenomena. An important example is the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 superlattice, where an interlayer electron transfer has been observed from LaTiO3 into LaNiO3 leading to a high&#8208;spin state. However, macroscopic emergence of magnetic order associated with this high&#8208;spin state has so far not been observed. Here, by using muon spin rotation, x&#8208;ray absorption, and resonant inelastic x&#8208;ray scattering, direct evidence of an emergent antiferromagnetic order with high magnon energy and exchange interactions at the LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface is presented. As the magnetism is purely interfacial, a single LaNiO3/LaTiO3 interface can essentially behave as an atomically thin strongly&#8208;correlated quasi&#8208;2D antiferromagnet, potentially allowing its technological utilization in advanced spintronic devices. Furthermore, its strong quasi&#8208;2D magnetic correlations, orbitally&#8208;polarized planar ligand holes, and layered superlattice design make its electronic, magnetic, and lattice configurations resemble the precursor states of superconducting cuprates and nickelates, but with an S&#8594;1 spin state instead.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Bioactivation of Inert Materials With Plasma&#8208;Polymerized Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional gas plasma treatments can significantly improve material properties for biomedical applications but are not applicable to important substrate classes such as proteins and hydrogels. Plasma polymer nanoparticles (PPN) are versatile functionalization tools compatible with aqueous systems, able to modify complex geometries that mimic the outcomes of plasma coating technology, but vastly expanding its applicability.








Abstract
Conventional gas plasma treatments are crucial for functionalizing materials in biomedical applications, but have limitations hindering their broader use. These methods require exposure to reactive media under vacuum conditions, rendering them unsuitable for substrates that demand aqueous environments, such as proteins and hydrogels. In addition, complex geometries are difficult to treat, necessitating extensive customization for each material and shape. To address these constraints, an innovative approach employing plasma polymer nanoparticles (PPN) as a versatile functionalization tool is proposed. PPN share similarities with traditional plasma polymer coatings (PPC) but offer unique advantages: compatibility with aqueous systems, the ability to modify complex geometries, and availability as off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf products. Robust immobilization of PPN on various substrates, including synthetic polymers, proteins, and complex hydrogel structures is demonstrated in this study. This results in substantial improvements in surface hydrophilicity. Materials functionalization with arginylglycylaspartic acid (RGD)&#8208;loaded PPN significantly enhances cell attachment, spreading, and substrate coverage on inert scaffolds compared to passive RGD coatings. Improved adhesion to complex geometries and subsequent differentiation following growth factor exposure is also demonstrated. This research introduces a novel substrate functionalization approach that mimics the outcomes of plasma coating technology but vastly expands its applicability, promising advancements in biomedical materials and devices.

Electronic devices based on paper and banknotes are successfully developed using a solution process with PVK and SnO2 NPs. These devices display photosynaptic behavior under UV pulse illumination and achieved a 91.7% recognition rate using the Yale Face Database. For security applications, the 20 &#215; 20 array configuration exhibits excellent performance, maintaining the same code under long&#8208;term storage and bending conditions.








Abstract
Paper is a readily available material in nature. Its recyclability, eco&#8208;friendliness, portability, flexibility, and affordability make it a favored substrate for researchers seeking cost&#8208;effective solutions. Electronic devices based on solution process are fabricated on paper and banknotes using PVK and SnO2 nanoparticles. The devices manufactured on paper substrates exhibit photosynaptic behavior under ultraviolet pulse illumination, stemming from numerous interactions on the surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles. A light&#8208;modulated artificial synapse device is realized on a paper at a low voltage bias of &#8722;0.01&#160;V, with an average recognition rate of 91.7% based on the Yale Face Database. As a security device on a banknote, 400 devices in a 20 &#215; 20 array configuration exhibited random electrical characteristics owing to the local morphology of the SnO2 nanoparticles and differences in the depletion layer width at the SnO2/PVK interface. The security Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) key based on the current distribution extracted at &#8722;1&#160;V show unpredictable reproducibility with 50% uniformity, 48.7% inter&#8208;Hamming distance, and 50.1% bit&#8208;aliasing rates. Moreover, the device maintained its properties for more than 210 days under a curvature radius of 8.75&#160;mm and bias and UV irradiation stress conditions.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Observation of Potential&#8208;Dependent Variations at the Surface of an Oxide Catalyst during Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Identifying catalyst surface structure during the OER is vital for sustainable water electrolysis. A series of dynamic displacements, paracrystallization, and further amorphization are observed at the (001) surface in LaCoO3 under different overpotentials. Theoretical calculations also suggest lattice oxygen activation with extensive atom displacement induced at higher anodic potentials. This highlights significant variations in the degradation behavior of OER catalysts, strongly depending on overpotential levels.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate details of the surface atomic structure and composition of catalysts during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing catalysts with high stability in water electrolyzers. While many notable studies highlight surface amorphization and reconstruction, systematic analytical tracing of the catalyst surface as a function of overpotential remains elusive. Heteroepitaxial (001) films of chemically stable and lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;inactive LaCoO3 are thus utilized as a model catalyst to demonstrate a series of atomic&#8208;resolution observations of the film surface at different anodic potentials. The first key finding is that atoms at the surface are fairly dynamic even at lower overpotentials. Angstrom&#8208;scale atomic displacements within the perovskite framework are identified below a certain potential level. Another noteworthy feature is that amorphization (or paracrystallization) with no long&#8208;range order is finally induced at higher overpotentials. In particular, surface analyses consistently support that the oxidation of lattice oxygen is coupled with amorphous phase formation at the high potentials. Theoretical calculations also reveal an upward shift of oxygen 2p states toward the Fermi level, indicating enhanced lattice oxygen activation when atom displacement occurs more extensively. This study emphasizes that the degradation behavior of OER catalysts can distinctively vary depending on the overpotential level.

         <title>2D Photonic Colloidal Liquid Crystals Composed of Self&#8208;Assembled Rod&#8208;Shaped Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D photonic colloidal liquid crystals comprised of biomineral/polymer nanorod hybrids dispersed in water are presented. These colloidal liquid crystals display vibrant structural colors with remarkable reflectance and pronounced angular dependence. The coloration is finely adjusted by modulating the concentration and size of the nanorods. Furthermore, these colloidal liquid crystals are immobilized in organic polymer network, showcasing mechanochromic properties with angular dependency.








Abstract
Photonic crystals, characterized by their periodic structures, have been extensively studied for their ability to manipulate light. Typically, the development of 2D photonic crystals requires either sophisticated equipment or precise orientation of spherical nanoparticles. However, liquid&#8208;crystalline (LC) materials offer a promising alternative, facilitating the formation of periodic structures without the need for complex manipulation. Despite this advantage, the development of 2D photonic periodic structures using LC materials is limited to a few colloidal nanodisk liquid crystals. Herein, 2D photonic colloidal liquid crystals composed of biomineral&#8208;based nanorods and water is reported. The soft photonic materials with 2D structure by self&#8208;assembled LC colloidal nanorods are unique and a new class of photonic materials different from conventional solid 2D photonic materials. These colloids exhibit bright structural colors with high reflectance (&gt;50%) and significant angular dependency. The structural colors are adjusted by controlling the concentration and size of the LC colloidal nanorods. Furthermore, mechanochromic hydrogel thin films with 2D photonic structure are developed. The hydrogels exhibit reversible mechanochromic properties with angular dependency, which can be used for an advanced stimuli responsible sensor.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Light&#8208;Induced Ferroelectric Polarization in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/Te Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study visualizes light&#8208;induced ferroelectric polarization in an &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323;/Te heterojunction using photocurrent mapping. The device shows nonvolatile photoresponsivity with photocurrent enhancement up to 1000 times after polarization saturation. These findings demonstrate the potential of 2D ferroelectric materials for advanced photodetectors and optical information storage applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced ferroelectric polarization in 2D layered ferroelectric materials holds promise in photodetectors with multilevel current and reconfigurable capabilities. However, translating this potential into practical applications for high&#8208;density optoelectronic information storage remains challenging. In this work, an &#945;&#8208;In2Se3/Te heterojunction design that demonstrates spatially resolved, multilevel, nonvolatile photoresponsivity is presented. Using photocurrent mapping, the spatially localized light&#8208;induced poling state (LIPS) is visualized in the junction region. This localized ferroelectric polarization induced by illumination enables the heterojunction to exhibit enhanced photoresponsivity. Unlike previous reports that observe multilevel polarization enhancement in electrical resistance, the device shows nonvolatile photoresponsivity enhancement under illumination. After polarization saturation, the photocurrent increases up to 1000 times, from 10&#8722;12 to 10&#8722;9 A under the irradiation of a 520&#160;nm laser with a power of 1.69 nW, compared to the initial state in a self&#8208;driven mode. The photodetector exhibits high detectivity of 4.6&#215;1010 Jones, with a rise time of 27 &#181;s and a fall time of 28 &#181;s. Furthermore, the device's localized poling characteristics and multilevel photoresponse enable spatially multiplexed optical information storage. These results advance the understanding of LIPS in 2D ferroelectric materials, paving the way for optoelectronic information storage technologies.

This study introduces light&#8208;triggered proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) nanoassemblies (LPNs) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis, persistently reprogramming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The LPNs, self&#8208;assembled from prodrug conjugates, deliver PROTACs and photosensitizers to tumor tissues. Subsequently, photodynamic therapy induces immunogenic cell death, while the recyclable action of PROTACs for IDO proteolysis enhances effector&#8208;T&#8208;cell activation and alleviates regulatory&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, inhibiting tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence.








Abstract
While proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hold great potential for persistently reprogramming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment via targeted protein degradation, precisely activating them in tumor tissues and preventing uncontrolled proteolysis at off&#8208;target sites remain challenging. Herein, a light&#8208;triggered PROTAC nanoassembly (LPN) for photodynamic indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase (IDO) proteolysis is reported. The LPN is derived from the self&#8208;assembly of prodrug conjugates, which comprise a PROTAC, cathepsin B&#8208;specific cleavable peptide linker, and photosensitizer, without any additional carrier materials. In colon tumor models, intravenously injected LPNs initially silence the activity of PROTACs and accumulate significantly in targeted tumor tissues due to an enhanced permeability and retention effect. Subsequently, the cancer biomarker cathepsin B begins to trigger the release of active PROTACs from the LPNs through enzymatic cleavage of the linkers. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death induced by photodynamic therapy to promote the activation of effector T cells, while the continuous IDO degradation of PROTAC simultaneously blocks tryptophan metabolite&#8208;regulated regulatory&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. Such LPN&#8208;mediated combinatorial photodynamic IDO proteolysis effectively inhibits tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence. Collectively, this study presents a promising nanomedicine, designed to synergize PROTACs with other immunotherapeutic modalities, for more effective and safer cancer immunotherapy.

Targeted imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis remains challenging due to its high heterogeneity. This study introduces a triple&#8208;targeted protein nanoprobe capable of specifically binding to three targets for imaging cancer lymphatic metastasis, utilizing a data&#8208;driven design approach combined with a synthetic biology&#8208;based assembly strategy. It offers a potential strategy for guiding targeted nanomedicine design to overcome tumor heterogeneity.








Abstract
Targeted imaging of cancer lymphatic metastasis remains challenging due to its highly heterogeneous molecular and phenotypic diversity. Herein, triple&#8208;targeted protein nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to three targets for imaging cancer lymphatic metastasis, through a data&#8208;driven design approach combined with a synthetic biology&#8208;based assembly strategy, are introduced. Specifically, to address the diversity of metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), a combination of three targets, including C&#8208;X&#8208;C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), transferrin receptor protein 1 (TfR1), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is identified, leveraging machine leaning&#8208;based bioinformatics analysis and examination of LN tissues from patients with gastric cancer. Using this identified target combination, ferritin nanocage&#8208;based nanoprobes capable of specifically binding to all three targets are designed through the self&#8208;assembly of genetically engineered ferritin subunits using a synthetic biology approach. Using these nanoprobes, multiplexed imaging of heterogeneous metastatic LNs is successfully achieved in a polyclonal lymphatic metastasis animal model. In 19 freshly resected human gastric specimens, the signal from the triple&#8208;targeted nanoprobes significantly differentiates metastatic LNs from benign LNs. This study not only provides an effective nanoprobe for imaging highly heterogeneous lymphatic metastasis but also proposes a potential strategy for guiding the design of targeted nanomedicines for cancer lymphatic metastasis.

         <title>A Photoelectrochemical Retinomorphic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a &#8220;multi&#8208;color&#8221; hydrogel&#8208;based photoelectrochemical retinomorphic synapse is reported with unique chemical&#8208;ionic&#8208;electrical signaling in an aqueous electrolyte that enables color perception and biomolecule&#8208;mediated synaptic plasticity. The synergy between the color&#8208;tunable hydrogels and Bi2S3 makes possible the color recognition at zero gate voltage. Taking advantage of the versatile biochemistry, the biochemical&#8208;driven reversible photoelectric response of the cone cell is mimicked.









Abstract
Reproducing human visual functions with artificial devices is a long&#8208;standing goal of the neuromorphic domain. However, emulating the chemical language communication of the visual system in fluids remains a grand challenge. Here, a &#8220;multi&#8208;color&#8221; hydrogel&#8208;based photoelectrochemical retinomorphic synapse is reported with unique chemical&#8208;ionic&#8208;electrical signaling in an aqueous electrolyte that enables, e.g., color perception and biomolecule&#8208;mediated synaptic plasticity. Based on the specific enzyme&#8208;catalyzed chromogenic reactions, three multifunctional colored hydrogels are developed, which can not only synergize with the Bi2S3 photogate to recognize the primary colors but also synergize with a given polymeric channel to promote the long&#8208;term memory of the system. A synaptic array is further constructed for sensing color images and biomolecule&#8208;coded information communication. Taking advantage of the versatile biochemistry, the biochemical&#8208;driven reversible photoelectric response of the cone cell is further mimicked. This work introduces rich chemical designs into retinomorphic devices, providing a perspective for replicating the human visual system in fluids.

         <title>A Dual Salt/Dual Solvent Electrolyte Enables Ultrahigh Utilization of Zinc Metal Anode for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual salt/dual solvent electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2/Zn(Ac)2 in water/TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) mixed solvents is designed to stabilize the zinc metal anode. The developed electrolyte with &#8220;inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent&#8221; synergistic effect enables corrosion&#8208;free zinc anode and fast zinc ion deposition kinetics. The zinc anode reversibility at ultrahigh utilization exceeds the performance recently reported.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#160;batteries&#160;are promising in next&#8208;generation sustainable energy storage. However, the low zinc (Zn) metal anode reversibility and utilization in aqueous electrolytes due to Zn corrosion and poor Zn2+ deposition kinetics significantly hinder the development of Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a dual salt/dual solvent electrolyte composed of Zn(BF4)2/Zn(Ac)2 in water/TEGDME (tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether) solvents to achieve reversible Zn anode at an ultrahigh depth of discharge (DOD) is developed. An &#8220;inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent&#8221; synergistic effect in this unique dual salt/dual solvent system is revealed. Experimental results and theoretical calculations provide evidence that the ether co&#8208;solvent inhibits water activity by forming hydrogen bonding with the water and coordination effects with the proton in the outer Zn2+ solvation structure. Meanwhile, the anion of zinc acetate co&#8208;salt enters the inner Zn2+ solvation structure, thereby accelerating the desolvation kinetics. Strikingly, based on the electrolyte design, the zinc anode shows high reversibility at an ultrahigh utilization of 60% DOD with 99.80% Coulombic efficiency and 9.39 mAh cm&#8722;2 high capacity. The results far exceed the performance reported in electrolyte design work recently. The work provides fundamental insights into inner co&#8208;salt and outer co&#8208;solvent synergistic regulation in multifunctional electrolytes for reversible aqueous metal&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Bioinspired Photosensitizer Performs Tumor Thermoresistance Reversion to Optimize the Atraumatic Mild&#8208;Hyperthermia Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with pendant leucines is introduced to achieve rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors. CP&#8208;PLeu exerts a photodynamic effect to reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor antagonism and optimizing atraumatic mild&#8208;hyperthermia photothermal therapy for breast cancer.








Abstract
Mild&#8208;hyperthermia photothermal therapy (mPTT) has therapeutic potential with minimized damage to normal tissues. However, the poorly vascularized tumor area severely hampers the penetration of photothermal agents (PTAs), resulting in their heterogeneous distribution and the subsequent heterogeneous local temperature during mPTT. The presence of regions below the therapeutic 42 &#176;C threshold can lead to incomplete tumor ablation and potential recurrence. Additionally, tumor anti&#8208;apoptosis and cytoprotection pathways, particularly activated thermoresistance, can nullify mild hyperthermia&#8208;induced tumor damage. Therefore, a bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with leucine to form biomimetic nanoclusters (CP&#8208;PLeu nanoparticles (NPs)) aimed at achieving rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors, is introduced. Moreover, CP&#8208;PLeu exhibits photodynamic effects that reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor resistance to hyperthermia. With the addition of NIR&#8208;II laser irradiation, CP&#8208;PLeu optimizes the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT and contributes to a minimally invasive therapeutic process for breast cancer. This therapeutic strategy, utilizing a biomimetic photosensitizer for homogeneous distribution of therapeutic temperature and photoactivated reversal of tumor thermoresistance, successfully achieves efficient breast tumor inhibition through an atraumatic mPTT process.

&lt;p&gt;A bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with pendant leucines is introduced to achieve rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors. CP-PLeu exerts a photodynamic effect to reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor antagonism and optimizing atraumatic mild-hyperthermia photothermal therapy for breast cancer.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild-hyperthermia photothermal therapy (mPTT) has therapeutic potential with minimized damage to normal tissues. However, the poorly vascularized tumor area severely hampers the penetration of photothermal agents (PTAs), resulting in their heterogeneous distribution and the subsequent heterogeneous local temperature during mPTT. The presence of regions below the therapeutic 42 &#176;C threshold can lead to incomplete tumor ablation and potential recurrence. Additionally, tumor anti-apoptosis and cytoprotection pathways, particularly activated thermoresistance, can nullify mild hyperthermia-induced tumor damage. Therefore, a bioinspired photosensitizer decorated with leucine to form biomimetic nanoclusters (CP-PLeu nanoparticles (NPs)) aimed at achieving rapid and homogeneous accumulation in tumors, is introduced. Moreover, CP-PLeu exhibits photodynamic effects that reverse tumor thermoresistance and physiological repair mechanisms, thereby inhibiting tumor resistance to hyperthermia. With the addition of NIR-II laser irradiation, CP-PLeu optimizes the therapeutic efficacy of mPTT and contributes to a minimally invasive therapeutic process for breast cancer. This therapeutic strategy, utilizing a biomimetic photosensitizer for homogeneous distribution of therapeutic temperature and photoactivated reversal of tumor thermoresistance, successfully achieves efficient breast tumor inhibition through an atraumatic mPTT process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tissue/Organ Adaptable Bioelectronic Silk&#8208;Based Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue/organ adaptable bioelectronic silk&#8208;based implants are devices fabricated on geometrically reconfigurable silk membranes for biomedical applications. Leveraging the unique properties of silk, these devices exhibit high biocompatibility and can deform into designed shapes to natively fit the target tissue/organ surfaces. Functions are integrated through processed silk and Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) technologies.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronic devices, designed for both monitoring and modulating living organisms, require functional and biological adaptability. Pure silk is innovatively employed, which is known for its excellent biocompatibility, to engineer water&#8208;triggered, geometrically reconfigurable membranes, on which functions can be integrated by Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) techniques and specially functionalized silk. These devices can undergo programmed shape deformations within 10&#160;min once triggered by water, and thus establishing stable bioelectronic interfaces with natively fitted geometries. As a testament to the applicability of this approach, a twining peripheral nerve electrode is designed, fabricated, and rigorously tested, demonstrating its efficacy in nerve modulation while ensuring biocompatibility for successful implantation.

         <title>Strong Elastic Protein Nanosheets Enable the Culture and Differentiation of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells on Microdroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid microcarriers are attractive solutions to enable cell culture in a scalable format, for stem cell manufacturing and applications in regenerative medicine. Here, iPSCs are cultured at the surface of microdroplets for the first time. This process is enabled by the self&#8208;assembly of strong elastic protein nanosheets that stabilize microdroplets, reinforce interfacial mechanics and engage cell adhesion receptors.








Abstract
Advances in stem cell technologies, revolutionizing regenerative therapies and advanced in vitro testing, require novel cell manufacturing pipelines able to cope with scale up and parallelization. Microdroplet technologies, which have transformed single cell sequencing and other cell&#8208;based assays, are attractive in this context, but the inherent soft mechanics of liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces is typically thought to be incompatible with the expansion of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and their differentiation. In this work, the design of protein nanosheets stabilizing liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces and enabling the adhesion, expansion and retention of stemness by iPSCs is reported. Microdroplet microfluidic chips are used to control the formulation of droplets with defined dimensions and size distributions. The resulting emulsions sustain high expansion rates, with excellent retention of stem cell marker expression. iPSCs cultured in such conditions retain the capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. This work provides clear evidence that local nanoscale mechanics, associated with interfacial viscoelasticity, provides strong cues able to regulate and maintain pluripotency, as well as to support commitment in defined differentiation conditions. Microdroplet technologies appear as attractive candidates to transform cell manufacturing pipelines, bypassing significant hurdles paused by solid substrates and microcarriers.

         <title>&#8220;Bowling Collision Effect&#8221; of CoMo6 Polyoxometalate Units Enables Wide Temperature Range from &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C and Dendrite Mitigation Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>

The study explores Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalates ([TMMo6O24]n&#8208;, TM = Co, Ni, Fe) as modified materials for Li&#8208;S battery separators, enhancing performance. CoMo6 units show optimal binding energy and Gibbs free energy, forming strong polar bonds with LiPSs. The resulting Li&#8208;S battery exhibits high capacity, excellent cycle life, and stability across &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C, advancing high&#8208;performance, all&#8208;weather Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
To improve the performance of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, the reaction catalysts of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) reactions should have the characteristics of large surface area, efficient atomic utilization, high conductivity, small size, good stability, and strong adjustability. Herein, Anderson&#8208;type polyoxometalate ([TMMo6O24]n&#8722;, TM = Co, Ni, Fe, represented by TMMo6 POMs) are used as the modified materials for Li&#8208;S battery separator. By customizing the central metal atoms, this work gains insights into the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer electron transfer mechanism between TMMo6 units and LiPSs, similar to the collision effect of a bowling ball. Theoretical analysis and in situ experimental characterization show that the changes of CoMo6 units with moderate binding energy and lowest Gibbs free energy result in the formation of robust polar bonds and prolonged S&#9472;S bonds after adsorption. Hence, the representative Li&#8208;S battery with CoMo6 and graphene composite modified separator has a high initial capacity of 1588.6&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, excellent cycle performance of more than 3000 cycles at 5 C, and uniform Li+ transport over 1900&#160;h. More importantly, this work has revealed the inherent contradiction between the kinetics and thermodynamics, achieving a stable cycle in the temperature range of &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Ultrahigh Responsivity and Robust Semiconducting Fiber Enabled by Molecular Soldering&#8208;Governed Defect Engineering for Smart Textile Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile molecular soldering&#8208;governed defect engineering strategy is proposed to simultaneously control the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale structural defects in wet&#8208;spun MoS2 semiconducting fibers, which affords two orders of magnitude enhancement in responsivity and remarkable mechanical robustness, thus enabling large&#8208;scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Semiconducting fibers (SCFs) are of significant interest to design next&#8208;generation wearable and comfortable optoelectronics that seamlessly integrate with textiles. However, the practical applications of current SCFs are always limited by poor optoelectronic performance and low mechanical robustness caused by uncontrollable multiscale structural defects. Herein, a versatile in situ molecular soldering&#8208;governed defect engineering strategy is proposed to construct ultrahigh responsivity and robust wet&#8208;spun MoS2 SCFs, by using a &#960;&#8208;conjugated dithiolated molecule to simultaneously patch microscale sulfur vacancies within MoS2 nanosheets, diminish mesoscale interlayer voids/wrinkles, promote macroscale orientation, build long&#8208;range photoelectron percolation bridges, and provide n&#8208;doping effect. The derived MoS2 SCFs exhibit over two orders of magnitude higher responsivity (144.3 A W&#8722;1) than previously reported fiber photodetectors, 37.3&#8208;fold faster photoresponse speed (52&#160;ms) than pristine counterpart, and remarkable bending robustness (retain 94.2% of the initial photocurrent after 50&#160;000 bending&#8208;flattening cycles). Such superior robustness and photodetection capacity of MoS2 SCFs further enable large&#8208;scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems, such as direction&#8208;identifiable wireless light alarming system, modularized mechano&#8208;optical communication system, and indoor light&#8208;controlled IoT system. This work offers a universal strategy for the scalable production of mechanically robust and high&#8208;performance SCFs, opening up exciting possibilities for large&#8208;scale integration of wearable optoelectronics.

Such superior robustness and photodetection capacity of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; SCFs further enable large-scale weaving of reliable smart textile optoelectronic systems, such as direction-identifiable wireless light alarming system, modularized mechano-optical communication system, and indoor light-controlled IoT system. This work offers a universal strategy for the scalable production of mechanically robust and high-performance SCFs, opening up exciting possibilities for large-scale integration of wearable optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Generalized Coordination Engineering Strategy for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Efficient Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
During the generalized coordination engineering strategy, the representative samples Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S are precisely synthesized, and both of them present excellent activity and H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;90%) compared with conventional Metal&#8208;N4 configurations. Moreover, they enable a high H2O2 production of 14.2 and 17.5 moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the three&#8208;phrase flow cell and maintain a satisfying stability over 12&#160;h.








Abstract
Designing non&#8208;noble metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs) for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8208;ORR) is attractive for the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis, in which the coordination configuration of the M&#8208;SACs essentially affects the reaction activity and product selectivity. Though extensively investigated, a generalized coordination engineering strategy has not yet been proposed, which fundamentally hinders the rational design of M&#8208;SACs with optimized catalytic capabilities. Herein, a generalized coordination engineering strategy is proposed for M&#8208;SACs toward H2O2 electrosynthesis via introducing heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen or sulfur atoms) with higher or lower electronegativity than nitrogen atoms into the first sphere of metal&#8208;N4 system to tailor their electronic structure and adjust the adsorption strength for *OOH intermediates, respectively, thus optimizing their electrocatalytic capability for 2e&#8208;ORR. Specifically, the (O, N)&#8208;coordinated Co SAC (Co&#8208;N3O) and (S, N)&#8208;coordinated Ni SAC (Ni&#8208;N3S) are precisely synthesized, and both present superior 2e&#8208;ORR activity (Eonset: &#8776;0.80&#160;V versus RHE) and selectivity (&#8776;90%) in alkaline conditions compared with conventional Co&#8208;N4 and Ni&#8208;N4 sites. The high H2O2 yield rates of 14.2 and 17.5&#160;moL&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and long&#8208;term stability over 12&#160;h are respectively achieved for Co&#8208;N3O and Ni&#8208;N3S. Such favorable 2e&#8208;ORR pathway of the catalysts is also theoretically confirmed by the kinetics simulations.

         <title>Highly Robust and Self&#8208;Adhesive Soft Strain Gauge via Interface Design Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multilayer soft strain gauges with strong and tough interfacial interactions are designed. Stable interface connections within the soft strain gauge allow for both high performance strain sensing and excellent mechanical/electrical robustness. The soft strain gauge's self&#8208;adhesive layer ensures seamless integration into complex dynamic surfaces for stable and fidelity signal acquisition.








Abstract
Highly robust soft strain gauges are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate in the fields of vital signs and machine conditions monitoring. However, it is still a key challenge to achieve high&#8208;performance strain sensing in these sensors with mechanical/electrical robustness for long&#8208;term usage. The multilayer structural design of sensors enhances sensing performance while the interfacial connection of heterogeneous materials between different layers is weak. Herein, inspired by the efficient perception mechanism of scorpion slit sensilla with tough interface interconnections, the synergy of ultra&#8208;high electrical performance and mechanical robustness is successfully achieved via interface design engineering. The developed multilayer soft strain gauge (MSSG) exhibits a strain sensitivity beyond 105, a lower detection limit of 8.3&#160;&#181;m, a frequency resolution within 0.1&#160;Hz, and cyclic stability over 63&#160;000 strain cycles. Also, the tough interface improves the level of heterogeneous integration in the MSSG which allows to endure different stresses. Furthermore, an MSSG&#8208;based wireless strain monitoring system is developed that enables applications on different complex dynamic surfaces, including accurate identification of human throat activity and monitoring of rolling bearing conditions.

SMART&#8208;EXO, a self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8211;shell microgel dressing with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion, enhances diabetic wound healing by enabling tunable contraction, activating mechanotransduction, and releasing bioactive exosomes. This dressing promotes fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, angiogenesis, and re&#8208;epithelialization.

Abstract
Chronic nonhealing skin wounds, characterized by reduced tissue contractility and inhibited wound cell survival under hyperglycemia and hypoxia, present a significant challenge in diabetic care. Here, an advanced self&#8208;contraction bioactive core&#8208;shell microgel assembly with robust tissue&#8208;adhesion (SMART&#8208;EXO) is introduced to expedite diabetic wound healing. The SMART&#8208;EXO dressing exhibits strong, reversible adhesion to damaged tissue due to abundant hydrogen and dynamic coordination bonds. Additionally, the core&#8208;shell microgel components and dynamic coordination bonds provide moderate rigidity, customizable self&#8208;contraction, and an interlinked porous architecture. The triggered in situ self&#8208;contraction of the SMART&#8208;EXO dressing enables active, tunable wound contraction, activating mechanotransduction in the skin and promoting the optimal fibroblast&#8208;to&#8208;myofibroblast conversion, collagen synthesis, and angiogenesis. Concurrently, the triggered contraction of SMART&#8208;EXO facilitates efficient loading and on&#8208;demand release of bioactive exosomes, contributing to re&#8208;epithelialization and wound microenvironment regulation in diabetic mice. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal the activation of critical signaling pathways associated with mechanosensing and exosome regulation, highlighting the combined biomechanical and biochemical mechanisms. These findings underscore SMART&#8208;EXO as a versatile, adaptable solution to the complex challenges of diabetic wound care.

         <title>Interstitial Optical Fiber&#8208;Mediated Multimodal Phototheranostics Based on an Aggregation&#8208;Induced NIR&#8208;II Emission Luminogen for Orthotopic Breast Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy combining one&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostic molecules with a modified optical fiber is developed to efficiently implement both second near&#8208;infrared fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; irradiation&#8208;triggered phototherapy for orthotopic breast tumors. Histological analysis results demonstrate thorough and complete tumor damage induced by the optical fiber&#8208;mediated phototherapy, in sharp contrast to the shallow treatment effect in a conventional manner.








Abstract
One&#8208;for&#8208;all phototheranostics based on a single molecule is recognized as a convenient approach for cancer treatment, whose efficacy relies on precise lesion localization through multimodal imaging, coupled with the efficient exertion of phototherapy. To unleash the full potential of phototheranostics, advancement in both phototheranostic agents and light delivery methods is essential. Herein, an integrated strategy combining a versatile molecule featuring aggregation&#8208;induced emission, namely tBuTTBD, with a modified optical fiber to realize comprehensive tumor diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; irradiation in the orthotopic breast tumor, is proposed for the first time. Attributed to the intense donor&#8208;acceptor interaction, highly distorted conformation, abundant molecular rotors, and loose intermolecular packing upon aggregation, tBuTTBD can synchronously undergo second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence emission, photothermal and photodynamic generation under laser irradiation, contributing to a trimodal NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;photoacoustic (PA)&#8208;photothermal imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy. The tumor treatment is further carried out following the insertion of a modified optical fiber, which is fabricated by splicing a flat&#8208;end fiber with an air&#8208;core fiber. This configuration aims to enable effective in situ phototherapy by maximizing energy utilization for therapeutic benefits. This work not only enriches the palette of NIR&#8208;II phototheranostic agents but also provides valuable insight for exploring an integrated phototheranostic protocol for practical cancer treatment.

Herein, an integrated strategy combining a versatile molecule featuring aggregation-induced emission, namely tBuTTBD, with a modified optical fiber to realize comprehensive tumor diagnosis and &#8220;inside-out&#8221; irradiation in the orthotopic breast tumor, is proposed for the first time. Attributed to the intense donor-acceptor interaction, highly distorted conformation, abundant molecular rotors, and loose intermolecular packing upon aggregation, tBuTTBD can synchronously undergo second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence emission, photothermal and photodynamic generation under laser irradiation, contributing to a trimodal NIR-II fluorescence-photoacoustic (PA)-photothermal imaging-guided phototherapy. The tumor treatment is further carried out following the insertion of a modified optical fiber, which is fabricated by splicing a flat-end fiber with an air-core fiber. This configuration aims to enable effective in situ phototherapy by maximizing energy utilization for therapeutic benefits. This work not only enriches the palette of NIR-II phototheranostic agents but also provides valuable insight for exploring an integrated phototheranostic protocol for practical cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Interfacial Charge Extraction by Bridging Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bridging molecule, (2&#8208;aminoethyl)phosphonic acid (AEP), is utilized to modify the buried SnO2/perovskite interface in PSCs. The dual functionality of AEP with adjacent interface leads to significant benefits such as defects suppression, increased film quality, and interfacial charge extraction improvement. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% (certified at 25.98%) is achieved with &#8776;1400 h operational durability.








Abstract
The interface between the perovskite layer and electron transporting layer is a critical determinate for the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The heterogeneity of the interface critically affects the carrier dynamics at the buried interface. To address this, a bridging molecule, (2&#8208;aminoethyl)phosphonic acid (AEP), is introduced for the modification of SnO2/perovskite buried interface in n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure PSCs. The phosphonic acid group strongly bonds to the SnO2 surface, effectively suppressing the surface carrier traps and leakage current, and uniforming the surface potential. Meanwhile, the amino group influences the growth of perovskite film, resulting in higher crystallinity, phase purity, and fewer defects. Furthermore, the bridging molecules facilitate the charge extraction at the interface, as indicated by the femtosecond transient reflection (fs&#8208;TR) spectroscopy, leading to champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.40% (certified 25.98%) for PSCs. Additionally, the strengthened interface enables improved operational durability of &#8776;1400 h for the unencapsulated PSCs under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1I protocol.

         <title>Chiral Co&#8208;Assembly with Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance Characteristics for High&#8208;Performance Circularly Polarized Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Promising chiral co&#8208;assemblies featuring CPL amplification are achieved by thermal annealing of assembled host, chiral inducers, and narrowband multi&#8208;resonance acceptor. The CP&#8208;OLEDs based on those co&#8208;assemblies exhibit excellent comprehensive device performance, such as gEL of 0.16, EQEmax of 4.6%, and FWHM of 39 nm, which are the best among all reported CP&#8208;OLEDs.








Abstract
A promising kind of ternary chiral co&#8208;assemblies with high PLQY, large dissymmetry factor (glum), and narrowband multi&#8208;resonance characteristics are achieved by codoped&#8208;thermal annealing treatments of achiral luminescent polymer F8BT, chiral inducers R/S&#8208;5011, and achiral FRET acceptor DBN&#8208;ICZ. The optimized co&#8208;assemblies (F8BT)0.9&#8208;(R/S&#8208;5011)0.1&#8208;(DBN&#8208;ICZ)0.005 display narrowband yellow emission with full&#8208;width half maximum (FWHM) of 37 nm, PLQY of 79%, and intense CPL signals with |glum| of up to 0.26. Meaningfully, solution&#8208;processed CP&#8208;OLEDs by using those ternary chiral co&#8208;assemblies as emitting layer are successfully fabricated, which display yellow circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) with EQEmax of 4.6% and gEL of up to 0.16. The corresponding Q&#8208;factor could reach up to 7.36 &#215; 10&#8722;3, which is the highest of all the reported CP&#8208;OLEDs. Moreover, the devices also exhibit excellent comprehensive device performance with low Von of 7.0 V, high Lmax of about 25&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, extremely low efficiency roll&#8208;off with EQE of 4.3% at 10&#160;000 cd m&#8722;2, as well as narrowband EL with FWHM of only 39 nm. The proposed ternary co&#8208;assembly strategy in fabricating CP&#8208;OLED provides the possibility to achieve high comprehensive device performance such as balancing high EQE and large gEL value, as well as narrowband emission, high brightness and low efficiency roll&#8208;off simultaneously.

         <title>Near Infrared&#8208;Fluorescent Dinuclear Iridium(III) Nanoparticles for Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound&#8208;triggered, near&#8208;infrared fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is reported to precisely and spatiotemporally generate reactive oxygen species for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy. Upon exposure to ultrasound irradiation, NanoIr inhibits tumor growth in CT26 tumor&#8208;bearing mice and elicits synergistic effects with the clinically approved chemotherapy drug cisplatin in patient&#8208;derived xenograft models of ovarian cancer.








Abstract
Dinuclear iridium(III) complexes activated by light&#8208;inducible spatiotemporal control are emerging as promising candidates for cancer therapy. However, broader applications of current light&#8208;activated dinuclear iridium(III) complexes are limited by the ineffective tissue penetration and undesirable feedback on guidance activation. Here, an ultrasound (US) triggered near infrared&#8208;fluorescent dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticle, NanoIr, is first reported to precisely and spatiotemporally inhibit tumor growth. It is demonstrated that reactive oxygen species can be generated by NanoIr upon exposure to US irradiation (NanoIr + US), thereby inducing immunogenic cell death. When combined with cisplatin, NanoIr + US elicits synergistic effects in patient&#8208;derived tumor xenograft mice models of ovarian cancer. This work first provides a design of dinuclear iridium(III) nanoparticles for immunogenic sonodynamic therapy.

         <title>Fully Degradable Polyphosphoester Cubosomes for Sustainable Agrochemical Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The urgent need to address microplastic pollution and promote sustainable agriculture has driven the development of fully degradable carriers for agrochemicals. A novel self&#8208;assembly method is introduced to produce porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), which are mesoporous (2&#8211;50 nm), and loaded with fungicides for effective release. These PCs show high antimycotic activity, adhere to leaves despite rain, and fully degrade into non&#8208;toxic byproducts, offering a promising solution for microplastic&#8208;free agrochemical delivery.








Abstract
Microplastic pollution and the urgent need for sustainable agriculture have raised interest in developing degradable carriers for controlled agrochemical release. Porous polymeric particles are particularly promising due to their unique release profiles compared to solid or core&#8208;shell carriers. However, creating degradable, mesoporous (2&#8211;50 nm) microparticles is challenging, and their potential for agrochemical delivery is largely unexplored.
A straightforward self&#8208;assembly method is demonstrated for fully degradable porous polymer cubosomes (PCs), showcasing their ability to load and release agrochemicals. Using fully degradable block copolymers (BCPs), poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)&#8208;b&#8208;polylactide (PEEP&#8208;b&#8208;PLA), PCs are synthesized in water with high inner order and open pores averaging 19 &#177; 3 nm in diameter. During the self&#8208;assembly process in the presence of the hydrophobic fungicide tebuconazole, polymersomes transform into PCs by enriching the hydrophobic polymer domain and altering the BCP packing parameter. After self&#8208;assemby, highly porous and fungicide&#8208;loaded PCs are obtained.
Fungicide&#8208;loaded PCs show high antimycotic activity against Botrytis cinerea (grey mold), adhere to Vitis vinifera Riesling leaves even after simulated rain, and release the fungicide continuously over several days with different release&#8208;kinetics compared to solid particles. PCs hydrolyze completely into lactic acid and phosphate derivatives, highlighting their potential as microplastic&#8208;free agrochemical delivery systems for sustainable agriculture.

Using fully degradable block copolymers (BCPs), poly(ethyl ethylene phosphate)-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-polylactide (PEEP-&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-PLA), PCs are synthesized in water with high inner order and open pores averaging 19 &#177; 3 nm in diameter. During the self-assembly process in the presence of the hydrophobic fungicide tebuconazole, polymersomes transform into PCs by enriching the hydrophobic polymer domain and altering the BCP packing parameter. After self-assemby, highly porous and fungicide-loaded PCs are obtained.
Fungicide-loaded PCs show high antimycotic activity against &lt;i&gt;Botrytis cinerea&lt;/i&gt; (grey mold), adhere to &lt;i&gt;Vitis vinifera&lt;/i&gt; Riesling leaves even after simulated rain, and release the fungicide continuously over several days with different release-kinetics compared to solid particles. PCs hydrolyze completely into lactic acid and phosphate derivatives, highlighting their potential as microplastic-free agrochemical delivery systems for sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;Memory in van der Waals Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ionic photovoltaics&#8208;in&#8208;memory has been found&#160;in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2. The migration of Br ions induces a reversible modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field, resulting in significant anisotropy and electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photovoltaic currents. Consequently, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is implemented. It&#160;opens up new possibilities for cutting&#8208;edge optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The photovoltaic effect is gaining growing attention in the optoelectronics field due to its low power consumption, sustainable nature, and high efficiency. However, the photovoltaic effects hitherto reported are hindered by the stringent band&#8208;alignment requirement or inversion symmetry&#8208;breaking, and are challenging for achieving multifunctional photovoltaic properties (such as reconfiguration, nonvolatility, and so on). Here, a novel ionic photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric CdSb2Se3Br2 that can overcome these limitations is demonstrated. The photovoltaic effect displays significant anisotropy, with the photocurrent being most apparent along the CdBr2 chains while absent perpendicular to them. Additionally, the device shows electrically&#8208;induced nonvolatile photocurrent switching characteristics. The photovoltaic effect is attributed to the modulation of the built&#8208;in electric field through the migration of Br ions. Using these unique photovoltaic properties, a highly secure circuit with electrical and optical keys is successfully implemented. The findings not only broaden the understanding of the photovoltaic mechanism, but also provide a new material platform for the development of in&#8208;memory sensing and computing devices.

         <title>In Situ Multi&#8208;Directional Liquid Manipulation Enabled by 3D Asymmetric Fang&#8208;Structured Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carefully designed fang&#8208;structured surface generates a unique distributed 3D multi&#8208;curvature, yielding a response to liquid surface tension for customized control of multi&#8208;directional liquid spreading. This enables innovative functions beyond conventional surfaces, including constructing selective multi&#8208;path circuits, portably indicating surface tensions of wetting liquids with a resolution of 0.3&#8211;3.4&#160;mN&#160;m&#8722;1, and temperature&#8208;mediated smart manipulation of liquids.








Abstract
Decorating surfaces with wetting gradients or topological structures is a prevailing strategy to control uni&#8208;directional spreading without energy input. However, current methods, limited by fixed design, cannot achieve multi&#8208;directional control of liquids, posing challenges to practical applications. Here, a structured surface composed of arrayed three&#8208;dimensional asymmetric fang&#8208;structured units is reported that enable in situ control of customized multi&#8208;directional spreading for different surface tension liquids, exhibiting five novel modes. This is attributed to bottom&#8208;up distributed multi&#8208;curvature features of surface units, which create varied Laplace pressure gradients to guide the spreading of different&#8208;wettability liquids along specific directions. The surface's capability to respond to liquid properties for multimodal control leads to innovative functions that are absent in conventional structured surfaces. Selective multi&#8208;path circuits can be constructed by taking advantage of rich liquid behaviors with the surface; surface tensions of wetting liquids can be portably indicated with a resolution scope of 0.3&#8211;3.4&#160;mN&#160;m&#8722;1 using the surface; temperature&#8208;mediated change of liquid properties is utilized to smartly manipulate liquid behavior and achieve the spatiotemporal&#8208;controllable targeted cooling of the surface at its heated state. These novel applications open new avenues for developing advanced surfaces for liquid manipulation.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Bioinspired Lignin Adhesive for Wearable Bioelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demethylation combined with intramolecular amino acid synergy endows biomass lignin with mussel&#8208;like, strong, reversible, and biocompatible adhesion. Excellent adhesion is confirmed at the molecular level, analyzed using molecular dynamics and density functional theory simulations, and tested in organohydrogel&#8208;based wearable bioelectronics at low dosages.








Abstract
As a natural &#8220;binder,&#8221; lignin fixes cellulose in plants to foster growth and longevity. However, isolated lignin has a poor binding ability, which limits its biomedical applications. In this study, inspired by mussel adhesive proteins, acidic/basic amino acids (AAs) are introduced in alkali lignin (AL) to form ionic&#8208;&#960;/spatial correlation interactions, followed by demethylation to create catechol residues for enhanced adhesion activity. Atomic force microscopy reveals that catechol residues are the primary adhesion structures, with basic AAs exhibiting superior synergistic effects compared to acidic AAs. Demethylated lysine&#8208;grafted AL exhibits the strongest adhesion force toward skin tissue. Molecular dynamic simulation and density functional theory calculations indicate that adhesion against skin tissue mainly results from hydrogen bonds and cation&#8208;&#960; interactions, with the adhesion mechanism being based on the Gibbs free energy of the Schiff base reaction. In summary, a biomimetic electrode based on lignin inspired by mussel adhesive proteins is prepared; the presented method offers a straightforward strategy for the development of biomimetic adhesives. Furthermore, this mussel&#8208;inspired adhesive can be used as a wearable bioelectrode in biomedical applications.

         <title>The Guardian of Vision: Intelligent Bacteriophage&#8208;Based Eyedrops for Clinical Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Ocular Surface Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel intelligent phage eyedrop for treating refractory bacterial keratitis caused by clinically isolated multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, combining a type I photosensitizer ACR&#8208;DMT with a phage is developed. This eyedrop maximizes the advantages of phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy to effectively target and kill multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria in the eye, preventing biofilm formation and promoting healing without scarring, and acts as a robust guardian of vision. 








Abstract
Clinical multidrug&#8208;resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR&#8208;PA) is the leading cause of refractory bacterial keratitis (BK). However, the reported BK treatment methods lack biosecurity and bioavailability, which usually causes irreversible visual impairment and even blindness. Herein, for BK caused by clinically isolated MDR&#8208;PA infection, armed phages are modularized with the type I photosensitizer (PS) ACR&#8208;DMT, and an intelligent phage eyedrop is developed for combined phagotherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT). These eyedrops maximize the advantages of bacteriophages and ACR&#8208;DMT, enabling more robust and specific targeting killing of MDR&#8208;PA under low oxygen&#8208;dependence, penetrating and disrupting biofilms, and efficiently preventing biofilm reformation. Altering the biofilm and immune microenvironments alleviates inflammation noninvasively, promotes corneal healing without scar formation, protects ocular tissues, restores visual function, and prevents long&#8208;term discomfort and pain. This strategy exhibits strong scalability, enables at&#8208;home treatment of ocular surface infections with great patient compliance and a favorable prognosis, and has significant potential for clinical application.

         <title>High&#8208;Detectivity All&#8208;Polymer Photodiode Empowers Smart Vitality Surveillance and Computational Imaging Rivaling Silicon Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;polymer organic photodiode with broadband competence is introduced with a newly designed acceptor material. The significantly&#160;improved OPD figures of merit with the polymer third component is investigated, focusing on exciton dynamics, morphology evolution, and trap characteristics. The OPD demonstrates competitive performance in machine learning&#8208;based blood pressure (BP) estimation and single&#8208;pixel imaging (SPI) in complex imaging environments, rivaling commercial silicon diodes.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic photodetectors (OPDs), particularly all&#8208;polymer&#8208;based ones, hold substantial commercial promise in the healthcare and imaging sectors. However, the process of optimizing their active layer composition to achieve highly competitive figures of merit lacks a clear direction and methodology. In this work, celebrity polymer acceptor PY&#8208;IT into a more NIR absorbing host system PBDB&#8208;T:PZF&#8208;V, to significantly enhance the photodetection competence, is introduced. The refined all&#8208;polymer ternary broadband photodetector demonstrates superior performance metrics, including experimentally measured noise current as low as 6 fA Hz&#8722;1/2, specific detectivity reaching 8&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones, linear dynamic range (LDR) of 145 dB, and swift response speed surpassing 200 kHz, striking a fair balance between sensitivity and response speed. Comprehensive morphological and photophysical characterizations elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed performance enhancements in this study, which include reduced trap density, enhanced charge transport, diminished charge recombination, and balanced electron/hole mobilities. Moreover, the practical deployment potential of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device in self&#8208;powered mode is demonstrated through their application in a machine learning&#8208;based cuffless blood pressure (BP) estimation system and in high&#8208;resolution computational imaging across complex environments, where they are found to quantitatively rival commercial silicon diodes.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron&#8208;Transfer Via Hybrid States at Perovskite/Fullerene Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With two&#8208;photon photoelectron spectroscopy, ultrafast electron&#8208;transfer of &#8776;100&#160;fs is observed between perovskite and fullerene. The timescale is comparable with hot&#8208;electron cooling inside perovskite, leading to efficient electron&#8208;transfer overcoming an unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignment. The process is achieved with the assistance of interfacial hybrid states, which originate from strong electronic coupling. This finding provides new guidelines for advanced device design.








Abstract
Interfacial charge&#8208;transfer between perovskite and charge&#8208;transport layers plays a key role in determining performance of perovskite solar cells. The conventional viewpoint emphases the necessity of favorable energy&#8208;level alignment of the two components. In recent reports, efficient electron&#8208;transfer is observed from perovskite to fullerene&#8208;based electron&#8208;transport layers even when there are unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignments, but the mechanism is still unclear. Here, using an ultrafast in situ two&#8208;photon photoelectron spectroscopy, real&#8208;time observations of electron&#8208;transfer processes at CsPbI3/C60 interface in both temporal and energetic dimensions are reported. Due to strong electronic coupling, a large amount of interfacial hybrid states is generated at the interfaces, aiding fast photoinduced electron&#8208;transfer in &#8776;124&#160;fs. This process is further verified by nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations and transient absorption experiments. The short timescale explains why electron&#8208;transfer can overcome unfavorable energy&#8208;level alignments, providing a guideline for device design.

         <title>Stabilizing Interlayer Repulsion in Layered Sodium&#8208;Ion Oxide Cathodes via Hierarchical Layer Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical layer modification strategy stabilizes interlayer repulsion and suppresses phase transformation in sodium&#8208;ion layered cathodes, achieving a single structure across a wide voltage by maintaining cationic content with migrated Li+ and anchored Ca2+, increasing oxygen layer valence with F&#8722; substitution and O redox reactions, and leveraging the interplay between robust Li&#9472;F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects.








Abstract
Layered sodium&#8208;ion oxides hold considerable promise in achieving high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious phase transformation during charging, attributed to increased O2&#8722;&#9472;O2&#8722; repulsion, results in substantial performance decay. Here, a hierarchical layer modification strategy is proposed to stabilize interlayer repulsion. During desodiation, migrated Li+ from the transition metal layer and anchored Ca2+ in sodium sites maintain the cationic content within the sodium layer. Meanwhile, partial oxygen substitution by fluorine and the involvement of oxygen in redox reactions increase the average valence of the oxygen layer. This sustained cation presence and elevated anion valence collectively mitigate increasing O2&#8722;&#9472;O2&#8722; repulsion during sodium extraction, enabling the Na0.61Ca0.05[Li0.1Ni0.23Mn0.67]O1.95F0.05 (NCLNMOF) cathode to retain a pure P2&#8208;type structure across a wide voltage range. Unexpected insights reveal the interplay between different doping elements: the robust Li&#9472;F bonds and Ca2+ steric effects suppressing Li+ loss. The NCLNMOF electrode exhibits 82.5% capacity retention after 1000 cycles and a high&#8208;rate capability of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1600&#160;mA g&#8722;1, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical layer modification for high&#8208;performance layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Unveiling the Role of Electric Double&#8208;Layer in Sulfur Catalysis for Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a competitive adsorption factor (fsulfur) to describe the sulfur adsorption in the electric double layer on the metal catalyst surface. An alloying method to alter it by enhancing p&#8211;d hybridization with electrolyte solvents is proposed, and a cobalt&#8211;zinc alloy catalyst with a moderate fsulfur shows enhanced activity and anti&#8208;passivation ability simultaneously in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
The metal&#8208;catalyzed sulfur reaction in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries usually suffers from the strong binding of sulfur species to the catalyst surface, which destroys the electric double layer (EDL) region there. This causes rapid catalyst deactivation because it prevents the desorption of sulfur species and mass transport through the EDL is hindered. This work introduces a competitive adsorption factor (fsulfur) as a new indicator to quantify the competitive adsorption of sulfur species in the EDL and proposes an alloying method to change it by strengthening the p&#8211;d hybridization of alloying metals with electrolyte solvents. A cobalt&#8211;zinc alloy catalyst with a moderate fsulfur lowers the activation energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step of the conversion of lithium polysulfides to lithium sulfide, giving a platform capacity proportion that is 96% of the theoretical value and has a greatly improved anti&#8208;passivation ability, especially at high sulfur loadings and lean electrolyte conditions (a low E/S ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1). A pouch cell using this approach has a high energy density of up to 464&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Such a competitive adsorption indicator and alloying strategy offer a new guideline for catalyst design and a practical electrocatalysis solution for Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A Soft&#8208;Fiber Bioelectronic Device with Axon&#8208;Like Architecture Enables Reliable Neural Recording In Vivo under Vigorous Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft fiber neural device resembling an axon skeleton with a network&#8208;in&#8208;liquid structure is constructed, having an ideal combination of stretchability, low modulus, low specific impedance, and high electrical conductivity. This fiber neural device can solve the longstanding problem of recording neurons in vivo under vigorous activities even in the deep brain of medium&#8208;sized animals.








Abstract
Implantable neural devices that record neurons in various states, including static states, light activities such as walking, and vigorous activities such as running, offer opportunities for understanding brain functions and dysfunctions. However, recording neurons under vigorous activities remains a long&#8208;standing challenge because it leads to intense brain deformation. Thus, three key requirements are needed simultaneously for neural devices, that is, low modulus, low specific interfacial impedance, and high electrical conductivity, to realize stable device/brain interfaces and high&#8208;quality transmission of neural signals. However, they always contradict each other in current material strategies. Here, a soft fiber neural device capable of stably tracking individual neurons in the deep brain of medium&#8208;sized animals under vigorous activity is reported. Inspired by the axon architecture, this fiber neural device is constructed with a conductive gel fiber possessing a network&#8208;in&#8208;liquid structure using conjugated polymers and liquid matrices and then insulated with soft fluorine rubber. This strategy reconciles the contradictions and simultaneously confers the fiber neural device with low modulus (300&#160;kPa), low specific impedance (579&#160;k&#937;&#160;&#181;m2), and high electrical conductivity (32&#160;700&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) &#8211; &#8776;1&#8211;3 times higher than hydrogels. Stable single&#8208;unit spike tracking in running cats, which promises new opportunities for neuroscience is demonstrated.

         <title>Achieving Ultrasound&#8208;Excited Emission with Organic Mechanoluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;excited fluorescence and phosphorescence with emission wavelengths extending into the near&#8208;infrared region are achieved using organic mechanoluminescent materials exhibiting high photoluminescence quantum yields, persistent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, and adjustable aggregated structures in the crystalline state. Accordingly, US&#8208;excited in vivo phosphorescence imaging of living mice is performed using a mechanoluminescence&#8208;based capsule device.








Abstract
Unlike traditional photoluminescence (PL), mechanoluminescence (ML) achieved under mechanical excitation demonstrates unique characteristics such as high penetrability, spatial resolution, and signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) for bioimaging applications. However, bioimaging with organic mechanoluminescent materials remains challenging because of the shallow penetration depth of ML with short emission wavelengths and the absence of a suitable mechanical force to generate ML in vivo. To resolve these issues, the present paper reports the achievement of ultrasound (US)&#8208;excited fluorescence and phosphorescence from purely organic luminogens for the first time with emission wavelengths extending to the red/NIR region, with the penetrability of the US&#8208;excited emission being considerably higher than that of PL. Consequently, US&#8208;excited subcutaneous phosphorescence imaging can be achieved using a mechanoluminescent&#8208;luminogen&#8208;based capsule device with a quantified intensity of 9.15 &#177; 1.32 &#215; 104 p s&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 sr&#8722;1 and an SBR of 24. Moreover, the US&#8208;excited emission can be adequately tuned using the packing modes of the conjugated skeletons, dipole orientation of mechanoluminescent luminogens, and strength and direction of intermolecular interactions. Overall, this study innovatively expands the kind of excitation sources and the emission wavelengths of organic mechanoluminescent materials, paving the way for practical biological applications based on US&#8208;excited emission.

         <title>Constructing Co4(SO4)4 Clusters within Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multinuclear metal clusters are widely used in nature for catalyzing small molecule activation reactions, which involve the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, a series of Co4(SO4)4&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their electrocatalytic properties for oxygen electrocatalysis are reported. The Co4(SO4)4 cluster has an unparalleled structure among previously reported Co&#8208;based clusters.








Abstract
Multinuclear metal clusters are ideal candidates to catalyze small molecule activation reactions involving the transfer of multiple electrons. However, synthesizing active metal clusters is a big challenge. Herein, on constructing an unparalleled Co4(SO4)4 cluster within porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and the electrocatalytic features of such Co4(SO4)4 clusters for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is reported. The reaction of CoII sulfate and metal complexes of tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin under solvothermal conditions afforded Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs (M&#9552;Co, Cu, and Zn). Crystallographic studies revealed that these Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs have the same framework structure, having the Co4(SO4)4 clusters connected by metalloporphyrin units through Co&#9472;Npyridyl bonds. In the Co4(SO4)4 cluster, the four CoII ions are chemically and symmetrically equivalent and are each coordinated with four sulfate O atoms to give a distorted cube&#8208;like structure. Electrocatalytic studies showed that these Co4&#8208;M&#8208;MOFs are all active for electrocatalytic OER and ORR. Importantly, by regulating the activity of the metalloporphyrin units, it is confirmed that the Co4(SO4)4 cluster is active for oxygen electrocatalysis. With the use of Co porphyrins as connecting units, Co4&#8208;Co&#8208;MOF displays the highest electrocatalytic activity in this series of MOFs by showing a 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 OER current density at 357&#160;mV overpotential and an ORR half&#8208;wave potential at 0.83&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Theoretical studies revealed the synergistic effect of two proximal Co atoms in the Co4(SO4)4 cluster in OER by facilitating the formation of O&#9472;O bonds. This work is of fundamental significance to present the construction of Co4(SO4)4 clusters in framework structures for oxygen electrocatalysis and to demonstrate the cooperation between two proximal Co atoms in such clusters during the O&#9472;O bond formation process.

         <title>Photocontrolled Reversible Solid&#8208;Fluid Transitions of Azopolymer Nanocomposites for Intelligent Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer nanocomposites with photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions are designed and used for the construction of intelligent nanomaterials. Photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions enable the solvent&#8208;free processing and reconfiguration of nanocomposites at room temperature, which represent an innovative strategy for the development of intelligent materials with responsive, rewritable, error&#8208;correctable, and dynamic properties.








Abstract
Intelligent polymer nanocomposites are multicomponent and multifunctional materials that show immense potential across diverse applications. However, to exhibit intelligent traits such as adaptability, reconfigurability and dynamic properties, these materials often require a solvent or heating environment to facilitate the mobility of polymer chains and nanoparticles, rendering their applications in everyday settings impractical. Here intelligent azopolymer nanocomposites that function effectively in a solvent&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature environment based on photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions via switching flow temperatures (Tfs) are shown. A range of nanocomposites is synthesized through the grafting of Au nanoparticles, Au nanorods, quantum dots, or superparamagnetic nanoparticles with photoresponsive azopolymers. Leveraging the reversible cis&#8208;trans photoisomerization of azo groups, the azopolymer nanocomposites transition between solid (Tf above room temperature) and fluid (Tf below room temperature) states. Such photocontrolled reversible solid&#8208;fluid transitions empower the rewriting of nanopatterns, correction of nanoscale defects, reconfiguration of complex multiscale structures, and design of intelligent optical devices. These findings highlight Tf&#8208;switchable polymer nanocomposites as promising candidates for the development of intelligent nanomaterials operative in solvent&#8208;free, room&#8208;temperature conditions.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Site Nucleation Growth of Twisted Bilayer MoS2 with Commensurate Angles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method, the gas&#8208;flow perturbation CVD approach to directly synthesis bilayer MoS2 homostructures with a clean interface and versatile twist angles ranging from 8&#176; to 56&#176; is developed. Enhanced moir&#233; excitons in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176; are evidenced by using the low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and density function theory (DFT) calculations.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, composed of two layers of transition metal dichalcogenides with a relative twist angle, provide a novel platform for exploring the correlated electronic phases and excitonic physics. Here, a gas&#8208;flow perturbation chemical vapor deposition (CVD) approach is demonstrated to directly grow MoS2 bilayer with versatile twist angles. It is found that the formation of twisted bilayer MoS2 homostructures sensitively depends on the gas&#8208;flow perturbation modes, correspondingly featuring the nucleation sites of the second layer at the same (homo&#8208;site) as or at the different (hetero&#8208;site) from that of the first layer. The commensurate twist angle of &#8776;22&#176; in homo&#8208;site nucleation strategy accounts for &#8776;16% among the broad range of twist angles due to its low formation energy, which is in consistence with the theoretical calculation. More importantly, moir&#233; interlayer excitons with the enhanced photoluminescence (PL) intensity and the prolonged lifetime are evidenced in the twisted bilayer MoS2 with a commensurate angle of 22&#176;, which is owing to the reason that the strong moir&#233; potential facilitates the interlayer excitons to be trapped in the moir&#233; superlattices. The work provides a feasible route to controllably built twisted MoS2 homostructures with strong moir&#233; potential to investigate the correlated physics in twistronics systems.

         <title>Trace Small Molecular/Nano&#8208;Colloidal Multiscale Electrolyte Additives Enable Ultra&#8208;Long Lifespan of Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Trace small molecular/nano&#8208;colloidal multiscale electrolyte additives, zinc acetylacetonate, enable ultra&#8208;long lifespan of zinc metal anodes (e.g., a superb cumulative plating capacity of 15 Ah cm&#8722;2). The slightly water&#8208;soluble additives exist not only as soluble small molecules, which efficiently regulate Zn2+ ion solvation structure, but also as insoluble nano&#8208;colloids, which in situ form a robust solid electrolyte interface film on zinc anodes.








Abstract
Electrolyte additives are efficient to improve the performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), yet the current electrolyte additives are limited to fully water&#8208;soluble additives (FWAs) and water&#8208;insoluble additives (WIAs). Herein, trace slightly water&#8208;soluble additives (SWAs) of zinc acetylacetonate (ZAA) were introduced to aqueous ZnSO4 electrolytes. The SWA system of ZAA is composed of a FWA part and a WIA part in a dynamic manner of dissolution equilibrium. The FWA part exists as soluble small molecules, which efficiently regulate Zn2+ ion solvation structure, while the WIA part exists as insoluble nano&#8208;colloids, which in&#8208;situ form a thick and robust solid electrolyte interface film on zinc metal anodes (ZMAs). Such small molecular/nano&#8208;colloidal multiscale electrolyte additives of ZAA are capable to not only improve ionic conductivity and transference number but also inhibit corrosion, hydrogen evolution, and Zn dendrite on ZMAs. The SWA&#8208;based Zn&#8741;Zn half battery delivers a superb cumulative plating capacity of 15 Ah cm&#8722;2 under 1 mAh cm&#8722;2 and 20 mA cm&#8722;2, and the SWA&#8208;based NH4V4O10&#8741;Zn pouch cell obtains a capacity retention of 67.8% within 4000 cycles under 4 A g&#8722;1. The study provides innovative insights for rational design of electrolyte additives, which may pave the way for the practicality of AZIBs.

         <title>Infectious and Inflammatory Microenvironment Self&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Peroxisomes with Synergetic Co&#8208;Ru Pair Centers for Programmed Diabetic Ulcer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infectious and inflammatory microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisome with synergetic Co&#8208;Ru pair centers (APCR) has been designed for programmed diabetic ulcer therapy. The synthesized APCR presents pH&#8208;switchable enzyme&#8208;like reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation activities, thus achieving the programmed bifunctional performances for bacterial sterilization in the infectious microenvironment and also alleviation of oxidative stress to promote wound tissue regeneration in the inflammatory microenvironment.








Abstract
Complex microenvironments with bacterial infection, persistent inflammation, and impaired angiogenesis are the major challenges in chronic refractory diabetic ulcers. To address this challenge, a comprehensive strategy with highly effective and integrated antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and accelerated angiogenesis will offer a new pathway to the rapid healing of infected diabetic ulcers. Here, inspired by the tunable reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation properties of natural peroxisomes, this work reports the design of infectious and inflammatory microenvironments self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisomes with synergetic Co&#8208;Ru pair centers (APCR) for programmed diabetic ulcer therapy. Benefiting from the synergistic Co and Ru atoms, the APCR can simultaneously achieve ROS production and metabolic inhibition for bacterial sterilization in the infectious microenvironment. After disinfection, the APCR can also eliminate ROS to alleviate oxidative stress in the inflammatory microenvironment and promote wound regeneration. The data demonstrate that the APCR combines highly effective antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and provascular regeneration capabilities, making it an efficient and safe nanomedicine for treating infectious and inflammatory diabetic foot ulcers via a programmed microenvironment self&#8208;adaptive treatment pathway. This work expects that synthesizing artificial peroxisomes with microenvironments self&#8208;adaptive and bifunctional enzyme&#8208;like ROS regulation properties will provide a promising path to construct ROS catalytic materials for treating complex diabetic ulcers, trauma, or other infection&#8208;caused diseases.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The configuration of the Helmholtz absorption plane plays an important role in manipulating the structure, composition, distribution, and properties of the derived cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) on the layered&#8208;oxide cathode. By rearranging the complex and structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane, an anion&#8208;tuned stable CEI can be dynamically constructed to resist attack from high&#8208;oxidation states, thus facilitating long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and solid electrolyte interphase reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of the Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component CEI proves effective for the long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves a 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Multidirectional Bending in Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast light&#8208;triggered multidirectional bending is demonstrated in soft twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles. The bending direction is dictated by the direction of the light leading to localized untwisting of the muscle. These artificial muscles can autonomously turn toward a light source, and they can be programmed for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in textiles.








Abstract
Using light to drive polymer actuators can enable spatially selective complex motions, offering a wealth of opportunities for wireless control of soft robotics and active textiles. Here, the integration of photothermal components is reported into shape memory polymer actuators. The fabricated twist&#8208;coiled artificial muscles show on&#8208;command multidirectional bending, which can be controlled by both the illumination intensity, as well as the chirality, of the prepared artificial muscles. Importantly, the direction in which these artificial muscles bend does not depend on intrinsic material characteristics. Instead, this directionality is achieved by localized untwisting of the actuator, driven by selective irradiation. The reaction times of this bending system are significantly &#8211; at least two orders of magnitude &#8211; faster than heliotropic biological systems, with a response time up to one second. The programmability of the artificial muscles is further demonstrated for selective, reversible, and sustained actuation when integrated in butterfly&#8208;shaped textiles, along with the capacity to autonomously orient toward a light source. This functionality is maintained even on a rotating platform, with angular velocities of 6&#176;/s, independent of the rotation direction. These attributes collectively represent a breakthrough in the field of artificial muscles, intended to adaptive shape&#8208;changing soft systems and biomimetic technologies.

         <title>Revealing Mode Formation in Quasi&#8208;Bound States in the Continuum Metasurfaces via Near&#8208;Field Optical Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;field microscopy technique is introduced that resolves and quantifies quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum modes in dielectric metasurfaces. The technique is employed for analyzing metasurface properties such as the finite array size effect, directional coupling, edge effects and defects on the single resonator level promising advancements in metasurface based catalysis and biospectroscopy by optimizing spatial footprint and active area.








Abstract
Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high&#8208;quality factors and strong near&#8208;field enhancement. Here, the mode formation in quasi&#8208;BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy (s&#8208;SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique, is quantitatively investigated. It is found that the quasi&#8208;BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8208;unit cells much smaller than expected from far&#8208;field measurements. Furthermore, it is shown that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi&#8208;BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.

         <title>Solvent Engineering of Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels Facilitates Strong and Large Contractile Actuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAAm) hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent interacts affinitively with the NIPAAm monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and significantly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting hydrogel. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation.








Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels can generate the actuation force through volumetric transitions in response to temperature changes. However, their weak mechanical properties and fragile actuation performance limit robust applications. Existing approaches to enhance these properties have typically depended on additional components, leading to an unavoidable interference to the actuation performance. In this work, robust thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels are fabricated through solvent engineering. A particular solvent, N&#8208;methylformamide, interacts affinitively with the carbonyl group of N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide monomer, solubilizes the monomer with extremely high concentration, stabilizes chain propagation during polymerization, and greatly increases chain lengths and entanglements of the resulting polymer. The synthesized hydrogels are highly elastic, strong, and tough, displaying remarkable thermo&#8208;responsive contractile actuation. The simple synthetic process can broaden its applicability in designing robust functional hydrogel applications.

All&#8208;in&#8208;one biomimetic nanoparticles are fabricated for long&#8208;acting enhanced PDT and PTT against tuberculosis. Those erythrocyte membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanoparticles simultaneously functionalized by granuloma&#8208;targeting, NIR&#8208;II emission, efficient ROS production, self&#8208;oxygenation, and good photothermal conversion characteristics, both facilitated delivery efficiency and extraordinary theranostic capability in the form of NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided combined phototherapy toward mouse tuberculous granuloma model.








Abstract
Tuberculosis, a fatal infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is difficult to treat with antibiotics due to drug resistance and short drug half&#8208;life. Phototherapy represents a promising alternative to antibiotics in combating M.tb. Exploring an intelligent material allowing effective tuberculosis treatment is definitely appealing, yet a significantly challenging task. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one biomimetic therapeutic nanoparticle featured by aggregation&#8208;induced second near&#8208;infrared emission, granuloma&#8208;targeting, and self&#8208;oxygenation is constructed, which can serve for prominent fluorescence imaging&#8208;navigated combined phototherapy toward tuberculosis. After camouflaging the biomimetic erythrocyte membrane, the nanoparticles show significantly prolonged blood circulation and increased selective accumulation in tuberculosis granuloma. Upon laser irradiation, the loading photosensitizer of aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer elevates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing M.tb damage and death. The delivery of oxygen to relieve the hypoxic granuloma microenvironment supports ROS generation during photodynamic therapy. Meanwhile, the photothermal agent, Prussian blue nanoparticles, plays the role of good photothermal killing effect on M.tb. Moreover, the growth and proliferation of granuloma and M.tb colonies are effectively inhibited in the nanoparticle&#8208;treated tuberculous granuloma model mice, suggesting the combined therapeutic effects of enhancing photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Broadband Sunlight&#8208;Like Emission in Single&#8208;Phase Phosphors: The Interplay of Structure and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research work develops ultra&#8208;broadband sunlight&#8208;like emission Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:Eu2+ phosphors with a 330 nm full width at half maximum using a heterovalent substitution strategy. The phosphors&#8217; unique luminescence makes the resulting white LEDs ideal for portable photodetection devices. Its high effectiveness is demonstrated by the precise identification of dye patterns via broad&#8208;spectrum testing of organic dyes, making it a top choice for mimicking sunlight.








Abstract
The quest for artificial light sources mimicking sunlight has been a long&#8208;standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators are often cost&#8208;prohibitive and bulky. Therefore, the development of a series of single&#8208;phase phosphors Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:0.1Eu2+ (x = 0&#8208;0.75) with sunlight&#8208;like emission represents a welcome step towards compact and economical light source alternatives. The phosphors are obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum &#160; spanning from violet to deep red.

&lt;p&gt;This research work develops ultra-broadband sunlight-like emission Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;LiMg&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2x/3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphors with a 330 nm full width at half maximum using a heterovalent substitution strategy. The phosphors&#8217; unique luminescence makes the resulting white LEDs ideal for portable photodetection devices. Its high effectiveness is demonstrated by the precise identification of dye patterns via broad-spectrum testing of organic dyes, making it a top choice for mimicking sunlight.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest for artificial light sources mimicking sunlight has been a long-standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators are often cost-prohibitive and bulky. Therefore, the development of a series of single-phase phosphors Ca&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;LiMg&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;2x/3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;:0.1Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (x = 0-0.75) with sunlight-like emission represents a welcome step towards compact and economical light source alternatives. The phosphors are obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum &#160; spanning from violet to deep red. Notably, the phosphor with &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; = 0.5 exhibits an impressive full width at half-maximum of 330&#160;nm. A synergistic interplay of experimental investigations and theory unveils the mechanism behind sunlight-like emission due to the local structural perturbations introduced by the heterovalent substitution of Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; for Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to a varied distribution of Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within the lattice. Subsequent characterization of a series of organic dyes combining absorption spectroscopy with convolutional neural network analysis convincingly demonstrates the potential of this phosphor in portable photodetection devices. Broad-spectrum light source testing empowers the model to precisely differentiate dye patterns. This points to the phosphor being ideal for mimicking sunlight. Beyond this demonstrated application, the phosphor's utility is envisioned in other relevant domains, including visible light communication and smart agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Lignin Polymers for Controlled CO2 Capture, Release, and Conversion into High&#8208;Value Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionic biomass lignin polymer is synthesized for capturing CO2 from direct&#8208;air and concentrated&#8208;CO2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The captured&#8208;CO2 is released in a controlled manner and utilized in the organic synthesis, demonstrating the productive application of the captured carbon. The CO2 capture &#8596; CO2 release cycles can be repeated continuously.








Abstract
In this study, an innovative and cost&#8208;effective ionic polymer for CO2 capture and utilization for the first time, using abundant and nonfood&#8208;based biomass lignin is reported. The modified ionic polymer synthesizes through the reaction of glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride with lignin under alkaline conditions to yield quaternary ammonium ionic functionality. Subsequently, the hydroxide&#8208;based pure ionic lignin polymer is employed for CO2 capture from both direct air and concentrated CO2 sources at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Structural characterization of the polymers is accomplished through 1H, 13C, and 2D&#8208;heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC)&#160;NMR, and FT&#8208;IR spectroscopy. The CO2 capture process is established through the formation of bicarbonate ions alongside the presence of CO2. The captured CO2 is precisely quantified by using inverse&#8208;gated proton decoupled 13C NMR with an internal standard (trioxane). Remarkably, the captured&#8208;CO2 amounts of ionic lignin polymer are 1.06&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 (47&#160;mg g&#8722;1) from concentrated&#8208;CO2 source and 0.60&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 (26&#160;mg g&#8722;1) from direct&#8208;air. The captured&#8208;CO2 in ionic lignin polymer is released in controlled manner and utilized in the synthesis of cyclic carbonate, showcasing the productive application of the captured carbon. Moreover, the fully controlled recovering of ionic lignin polymer achieves via repeated CO2 release &#8596; CO2 capture.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Intermetallic Heterostructure on Hierarchical Nanoporous Metal for Highly Efficient Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten&#8208;bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on nanoporous Ni skeleton exhibits exceptional activities and durability for hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. Such dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure enables interfacial atoms to configure multisites to accelerate water dissociation/combination, demonstrating the feasibility to construct well&#8208;defined active multisites for multiple&#8208;intermediate reactions based on intermetallic compounds.








Abstract
Constructing well&#8208;defined active multisites is an effective strategy to break linear scaling relationships to develop high&#8208;efficiency catalysts toward multiple&#8208;intermediate reactions. Here, dual&#8208;intermetallic heterostructure composed of tungsten&#8208;bridged Co3W and WNi4 intermetallic compounds seamlessly integrated on hierarchical nanoporous nickel skeleton is reported as a high&#8208;performance nonprecious electrocatalyst for alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reactions. By virtue of interfacial tungsten atoms configuring contiguous multisites with proper adsorptions of hydrogen and hydroxyl intermediates to accelerate water dissociation/combination and column&#8208;nanostructured nickel skeleton facilitating electron and ion/molecule transportations, nanoporous nickel&#8208;supported Co3W&#8211;WNi4 heterostructure exhibits exceptional hydrogen electrocatalysis in alkaline media, with outstanding durability and impressive catalytic activities for hydrogen oxidation reaction (geometric exchange current density of &#8776;6.62 mA cm&#8722;2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (current density of &#8776;1.45 A cm&#8722;2 at overpotential of 200 mV). Such atom&#8208;ordered intermetallic heterostructure alternative to platinum group metals shows genuine potential for hydrogen production and utilization in hydroxide&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers and fuel cells.

         <title>Large Orientation Angle Buried Substrate Enables Efficient Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (A&#8208;4PADCB) is designed and synthesized, demonstrating favorable coverage on ITO and optimized interface contact with perovskite. When applied A&#8208;4PADCB as buried substrate, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.05% for flexible perovskite solar cells and 20.64% (certified 19.51%) for flexible perovskite solar modules are obtained, which are the highest PCEs in the reported literature.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) have emerged as potential candidates for specific mechanical applications owing to their high foldability, efficiency, and portability. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of f&#8208;PSC remains limited by the inferior contact between perovskite and flexible buried substrate. Here, an asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) (4&#8208;(9H&#8208;dibenzo[a,c]carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl)phosphonic acid (A&#8208;4PADCB) is reported as a buried substrate for efficient inverted f&#8208;PSCs. Employing this design strategy, A&#8208;4PADCB exhibits a significant orientation angle away from the surface normal, homogenizing the distribution of contact potentials. This enhancement improves the SAM/perovskite interface quality, controlling the growth of favorable perovskite films with low defect density and slight tensile stress. Integration of A&#8208;4PADCB into small&#8208;area f&#8208;PSCs and large&#8208;area flexible perovskite solar modules with an aperture area of 20.84&#160;cm2 achieves impressive PCEs of up to 25.05% and 20.64% (certified 19.51%), respectively. Moreover, these optimized A&#8208;4PADCB&#8208;based f&#8208;PSCs possess enhanced light, thermal, and mechanical stability. This research paves a promising avenue toward the design of SAM&#8208;buried substrates with a large orientation angle, regulating perovskite growth, and promoting the commercialization of large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photovoltaics.

A P, S co&#8208;coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and analyze the influence of coordination structure on electrochemical performance. The well&#8208;designed CoSA&#8208;N3PS structure can promote d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby accelerating the bi&#8208;directional redox process of sulfur and exhibiting satisfactory electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been increasingly explored in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries to address the issues of severe polysulfide shuttle effects and sluggish redox kinetics. However, the structure&#8208;activity relationship between single&#8208;atom coordination structures and the performance of Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries remain unclear. In this study, a P, S co&#8208;coordination asymmetric configuration of single atoms is designed to enhance the catalytic activity of Co central atoms and promote d&#8208;p orbital hybridization between Co and S atoms, thereby limiting polysulfides and accelerating the bidirectional redox process of sulfur. The well&#8208;designed SACs enable Li&#8211;S batteries to demonstrate an ultralow capacity fading rate of 0.027% per cycle after 2000 cycles at a high rate of 5 C. Furthermore, they display excellent rate performance with a capacity of 619 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultrahigh rate of 10 C due to the efficient catalysis of CoSA&#8208;N3PS. Importantly, the assembled pouch cell still retains a high discharge capacity of 660 mAh g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles at 0.2 C and provides a high areal capacity of 4.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a high sulfur loading of 6&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates that regulating the coordination environment of SACs is of great significance for achieving state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Mullite Mineral&#8208;Derived Robust Solid Electrolyte Enables Polyiodide Shuttle&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mullite is transformed as high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Zn&#8208;ML) to address the issues of zinc dendrites, iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle for Zn//AC@I2 batteries. For the Zn anode, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte eliminates the side reactions and guides the uniform zinc deposition behavior. For the AC@I2 cathode, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte minimizes the active iodine dissolution and inhibits the polyiodide shuttle, endowing long&#8208;term cyclic stability.








Abstract
Zinc dendrite, active iodine dissolution, and polyiodide shuttle caused by the strong interaction between liquid electrolyte and solid electrode are the chief culprits for the capacity attenuation of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs). Herein, mullite is adopted as raw material to prepare Zn&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte (Zn&#8208;ML) for ZIBs through zinc ion exchange strategy. Owing to the merits of low electronic conductivity, low zinc diffusion energy barrier, and strong polyiodide adsorption capability, Zn&#8208;ML electrolyte can effectively isolate the redox reactions of zinc anode and AC@I2 cathode, guide the reversible zinc deposition behavior, and inhibit the active iodine dissolution as well as polyiodide shuttle during cycling process. As expected, wide operating voltage window of 2.7&#160;V (vs Zn2+/Zn), high Zn2+ transference number of 0.51, and low activation energy barrier of 29.7&#160;kJ mol&#8722;1 can be achieved for the solid&#8208;state Zn//Zn cells. Meanwhile, high reversible capacity of 127.4 and 107.6 mAh g&#8722;1 can be maintained at 0.5 and 1 A g&#8722;1 after 3&#160;000 and 2&#160;100 cycles for the solid&#8208;state Zn//AC@I2 batteries, corresponding to high&#8208;capacity retention ratio of 85.2% and 80.7%, respectively. This study will inspire the development of mineral&#8208;derived solid electrolyte, and facilitate its application in Zn&#8208;based secondary batteries.

         <title>Confining Iodine into Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Derived Metal&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Carbon for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of several Zn&#8208;MOFs is adopted for obtaining porous carbon materials. Moreover, iron&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon materials, featuring atomic Fe coordinated to nitrogen atoms, are further prepared and utilized as efficient cathode hosts for aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. The wearable microbattery application offers insights for future developments in long&#8208;lasting aqueous battery designs.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine batteries (AZIBs) are highly appealing for energy requirements owing to their safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability. However, the inadequate redox kinetics and severe shuttling effect of polyiodide ions impede their commercial viability. Herein, several Zn&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived porous carbon materials are designed, and the further preparation of iron&#8211;doped porous carbon (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, M9) with varied Fe doping contents is optimized based on a facile self&#8208;assembly/carbonization approach. M9, with atomic Fe coordinated to nitrogen atoms, is employed as an efficient cathode host for AZIBs. Functional modifications of porous carbon hosts involving the doping species and levels are investigated. The adsorption tests, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ UV&#8211;vis results demonstrate the adsorption capability and charge&#8208;discharge mechanism for the iodine species. Furthermore, experimental findings and theoretical analyses have proven that the redox conversion of iodine is enhanced through a physicochemical confinement effect. This study offers basic principles for the strategic design of single&#8208;atom dispersed carbon as an iodine host for high&#8208;performance AZIBs. Flexible soft&#8211;pack battery and wearable microbattery applications also have implications for future long&#8208;life aqueous battery designs.

Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis
The work by Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung and co&#8208;workers conveys a crucial message: angstrom&#8208;level atomic displacement on the surface, followed by catalytic degradation, appears to commonly occur in many catalysts, even though no substantial elemental dissolution takes place. Moreover, even catalysts known to be stable can undergo significant oxidation of lattice oxygen under high overpotentials. More details can be found in article number 2403392.

Moreover, even catalysts known to be stable can undergo significant oxidation of lattice oxygen under high overpotentials. More details can be found in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202403392"&gt;2403392&lt;/a&gt;.

Cancer Immunotherapy
Man Kyu Shim, Yongju Kim, Yoosoo Yang, and colleagues develope a light&#8208;triggered proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimera (PROTAC) nanoassembly. This nanoassembly accumulates significantly in tumor tissues, triggering a burst release of active PROTACs. Upon light irradiation, tumor cells undergo immunogenic cell death to promote T cell activation, while the recyclable action of the PROTACs simultaneously blocks regulatory T cell&#8208;mediated immunosuppression. More details can be found in article number 2405475.

Mimicking Sunlight
An unprecedented ultra&#8208;broadband full&#8208;spectrum emission phosphor is designed by local structural modulation with Al3+ heterovalent substitution of Mg2+. The phosphor emits an ultra&#8208;broadband spectrum covering the entire visible range, closely matching the sun's emission. This phosphor is ideal for simulating sunlight and is promising for applications in color hue detection, visible light communication, and smart agriculture. More details can be found in article number 2406164 by Jean&#8208;Claude G. B&#252;nzli, Lei Zhou, Mingmei Wu, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Negative Photoconductivity Transistors for Visuomorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Significant progress has been made in visuomorphic computing, but challenges remain in perceiving complex interactive environments. This review is the first to discuss the development and application of NPTs in the field of visuomorphic computing and provides a good reference for others to design lower power consumption, multivisual task coordinated, and multisensory fused artificial vision systems.








Abstract
Visuomorphic computing aims to simulate and potentially surpass the human retina by mimicking biological visual perception with an artificial retina. Despite significant progress, challenges persist in perceiving complex interactive environments. Negative photoconductivity transistors (NPTs) mimic synaptic behavior by achieving adjustable positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC), simulating &#8220;excitation&#8221; and &#8220;inhibition&#8221; akin to sensory cell signals. In complex interactive environments, NPTs are desired for visuomorphic computing that can achieve a better sense of information, lower power consumption, and reduce hardware complexity. In this review, it is started by introducing the development process of NPTs, while placing a strong emphasis on the device structures, working mechanisms, and key performance parameters. The common material systems employed in NPTs based on their functions are then summarized. Moreover, it is proceeded to summarize the noteworthy applications of NPTs in optoelectronic devices, including advanced multibit nonvolatile memory, optoelectronic logic gates, optical encryption, and visual perception. Finally, the challenges and prospects that lie ahead in the ongoing development of NPTs are addressed, offering valuable insights into their applications in optoelectronics and a comprehensive understanding of their significance.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Artificial Synapses for Sustainable Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in functional hydrogel&#8208;based transistors and memristors and their potential as artificial synapses are discussed. In doing so, an outlook on new biocompatible and sustainable neuromorphic hardware is provided and how potential energy&#8208;efficient information storage and processing can be achieved using artificial neural networks with brain&#8208;inspired architecture for neuromorphic computing is discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels find widespread applications in biomedicine because of their outstanding biocompatibility, biodegradability, and tunable material properties. Hydrogels can be chemically functionalized or reinforced to respond to physical or chemical stimulation, which opens up new possibilities in the emerging field of intelligent bioelectronics. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in functional hydrogel&#8208;based transistors and memristors is reviewed as potential artificial synapses. Within these systems, hydrogels can serve as semisolid dielectric electrolytes in transistors and as switching layers in memristors. These synaptic devices with volatile and non&#8208;volatile resistive switching show good adaptability to external stimuli for short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term synaptic memory effects, some of which are integrated into synaptic arrays as artificial neurons; although, there are discrepancies in switching performance and efficacy. By comparing different hydrogels and their respective properties, an outlook is provided on a new range of biocompatible, environment&#8208;friendly, and sustainable neuromorphic hardware. How potential energy&#8208;efficient information storage and processing can be achieved using artificial neural networks with brain&#8208;inspired architecture for neuromorphic computing is described. The development of hydrogel&#8208;based artificial synapses can significantly impact the fields of neuromorphic bionics, biometrics, and biosensing.

This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the distribution and function of bacteria within tumors, highlighting their significance in cancer development and treatment.








Abstract
In recent years, advancements in microbial sequencing technology have sparked an increasing interest in the bacteria residing within solid tumors and its distribution and functions in various tumors. Intratumoral bacteria critically modulate tumor oncogenesis and development through DNA damage induction, chronic inflammation, epigenetic alterations, and metabolic and immune regulation, while also influencing cancer treatment efficacy by affecting drug metabolism. In response to these discoveries, a variety of anti&#8208;cancer therapies targeting these microorganisms have emerged. These approaches encompass oncolytic therapy utilizing tumor&#8208;associated bacteria, the design of biomaterials based on intratumoral bacteria, the use of intratumoral bacterial components for drug delivery systems, and comprehensive strategies aimed at the eradication of tumor&#8208;promoting bacteria. Herein, this review article summarizes the distribution patterns of bacteria in different solid tumors, examines their impact on tumors, and evaluates current therapeutic strategies centered on tumor&#8208;associated bacteria. Furthermore, the challenges and prospects for developing drugs that target these bacterial communities are also explored, promising new directions for cancer treatment.

         <title>Approaching Splendid Catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 Battery from the Theory to Practical Designing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>

Li&#8211;CO2 batteries are new promising energy storage technologies of the next generation. In order to design splendid catalysts for practical Li&#8211;CO2 battery, this review summarizes the possible Li&#8211;CO2 energy storage mechanisms and the advance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries in terms of composition, geometry, and phase. Ways toward practical applications are also presented for the first time.








Abstract
Lithium carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, noted for their high discharge voltage of approximately 2.8&#160;V and substantial theoretical specific energy of 1876&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, represent a promising avenue for new energy sources and CO2 emission reduction. However, the practical application of these batteries faces significant hurdles, particularly at high current densities and over extended cycle lives, due to their complex reaction mechanisms and slow kinetics. This paper delves into the recent advancements in cathode catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, with a specific focus on the designing philosophy from composition, geometry, and homogeneity of the catalysts to the proper test conditions and real&#8208;world application. It surveys the possible catalytic mechanisms, giving readers a brief introduction of how the energy is stored and released as well as the critical exploration of the relationship between material properties and performances. Specifically, optimization and standardization of test conditions for Li&#8211;CO2 battery research is highlighted to enhance data comparability, which is also critical to facilitate the practical application of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. This review aims to bring up inspiration from previous work to advance the design of more effective and sustainable cathode catalysts, tailored to meet the practical demands of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Like Surfaces with Enhanced De&#8208;Wettability and Durability: From Structural Designs to Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;like surfaces with repellency have shown great potential in the fields of biology, environment, energy, and catalysis. However, they currently encounter challenges in superior de&#8208;wettability and durability. This review summarizes the recent progress of LLSs with enhanced de&#8208;wettability and durability via novel structural designs. Furthermore, potential applications of LLSs with enhanced de&#8208;wettability and durability are reviewed.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;like surfaces (LLSs) with dynamic repellency toward various pollutants (e.g., bacteria, oil, and ice), have shown enormous potential in the fields of biology, environment, and energy. However, most of the reported LLSs cannot meet the demands for practical applications, particularly in terms of de&#8208;wettability and durability. To solve these problems, considerable progress has been made in enhancing the de&#8208;wettability and durability of LLSs in complex environments. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the recent progress in LLSs, encompassing designed structures and repellent capabilities, as well as their diverse applications, offering greater insights for the targeted design of desired LLSs.

     alt="Liquid-Like Surfaces with Enhanced De-Wettability and Durability: From Structural Designs to Potential Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid-like surfaces with repellency have shown great potential in the fields of biology, environment, energy, and catalysis. However, they currently encounter challenges in superior de-wettability and durability. This review summarizes the recent progress of LLSs with enhanced de-wettability and durability via novel structural designs. Furthermore, potential applications of LLSs with enhanced de-wettability and durability are reviewed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid-like surfaces (LLSs) with dynamic repellency toward various pollutants (e.g., bacteria, oil, and ice), have shown enormous potential in the fields of biology, environment, and energy. However, most of the reported LLSs cannot meet the demands for practical applications, particularly in terms of de-wettability and durability. To solve these problems, considerable progress has been made in enhancing the de-wettability and durability of LLSs in complex environments. Therefore, this review mainly focuses on the recent progress in LLSs, encompassing designed structures and repellent capabilities, as well as their diverse applications, offering greater insights for the targeted design of desired LLSs. First, a detailed overview of the development of LLSs from the perspective of their molecular structural evolution is provided. Then highlight recent approaches for enhancing the dynamic de-wettability and durability of LLSs by optimizing their structural designs, including linear, looped, crosslinked, and hybrid structures. Later, the diverse applications and unique advantages of recently developed LLSs, including repellency (e.g., liquid anti-adhesion/transportation/condensation, anti-icing/scaling/waxing, and biofouling repellency) are summarized. Finally, Perspectives on potential innovative advancements and the promotion of technology selection to advance this exciting field are offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs) are prioritized for next&#8208;generation energy storage. However, numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces present challenges that hinder their development. This review focuses on electron and lithium&#8208;ion transport mechanisms at these interfaces and summarizes interface modification strategies. By correlating carrier transport networks with battery performance, design principles are outlined for achieving selective carrier transport to better guide future practical applications.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;ion batteries (SSLIBs) have been considered as the priority candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage system, due to their advantages in safety and energy density compare with conventional liquid electrolyte systems. However, the introduction of numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces results in a series of issues, hindering the further development of SSLIBs. Therefore, a thorough understanding on the interfacial issues is essential to promote the practical applications for SSLIBs. In this review, the interface issues are discussed from the perspective of transportation mechanism of electrons and lithium ions, including internal interfaces within cathode/anode composites and solid electrolytes (SEs), as well as the apparent electrode/SEs interfaces. The corresponding interface modification strategies, such as passivation layer design, conductive binders, and thermal sintering methods, are comprehensively summarized. Through establishing the correlation between carrier transport network and corresponding battery electrochemical performance, the design principles for achieving a selective carrier transport network are systematically elucidated. Additionally, the future challenges are speculated and research directions in tailoring interfacial structure for SSLIBs. By providing the insightful review and outlook on interfacial charge transfer, the industrialization of SSLIBs are aimed to promoted.

         <title>Asymmetric Atomic Dual&#8208;Sites for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 38, September 19, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;property relationship between the asymmetric atomic dual sites and the CO2RR is reviewed. A timely reference for researchers engages in the design and development of photocatalyst to explore a promising approach for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways. Some perspectives are provided for achieving efficient and sustainable photocatalysis based on tailoring strategies, design of active sites, and future challenges.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed active sites in a photocatalyst offer unique advantages such as locally tuned electronic structures, quantum size effects, and maximum utilization of atomic species. Among these, asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites are of particular interest because their asymmetric charge distribution generates a local built&#8208;in electric potential to enhance charge separation and transfer. Moreover, the dual sites provide flexibility for tuning complex multielectron and multireaction pathways, such as CO2 reduction reactions. The coordination of dual sites opens new possibilities for engineering the structure&#8211;activity&#8211;selectivity relationship. This comprehensive overview discusses efficient and sustainable photocatalysis processes in photocatalytic CO2 reduction, focusing on strategic active&#8208;site design and future challenges. It serves as a timely reference for the design and development of photocatalytic conversion processes, specifically exploring the utilization of asymmetric atomic dual&#8208;sites for complex photocatalytic conversion pathways, here exemplified by the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals.

         <title>Accurate Simulation for 2D Lubricating Materials in Realistic Environments: From Classical to Quantum Mechanical Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective reviews the simulation methods from classical to quantum mechanical ones for 2D lubricating materials in realistic environments and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing atomic and electronic mechanisms. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is proposed to try to provide more ways to reveal the friction mechanisms and guide the material design.








Abstract
2D materials such as graphene, MoS2, and hexagonal BN are the most advanced solid lubricating materials with superior friction and anti&#8208;wear performance. However, as a typical surface phenomenon, the lubricating properties of 2D materials are largely dependent on the surrounding environment, such as temperature, stress, humidity, oxygen, and other environmental substances. Given the technical challenges in experiment for real&#8208;time and in situ detection of microscopic environment&#8211;material interaction, recent years have witnessed the acceleration of computational research on the lubrication behavior of 2D materials in realistic environments. This study reviews the up&#8208;to&#8208;date computational studies for the effect of environmental factors on the lubrication performance of 2D materials, summarizes the theoretical methods in lubrication from classical to quantum&#8208;mechanics ones, and emphasizes the importance of quantum method in revealing the lubrication mechanism at atomic and electronic level. An effective simulation method based on ab initio molecular dynamics is also proposed to try to provide more ways to accurately reveal the friction mechanisms and reliably guide the lubricating material design. On the basis of current development, future prospects, and challenges for the simulation and modeling in lubrication with realistic environment are&#160;outlined.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Metal Catalysts for the Conversion of CO2 into High&#8208;Value C2+ Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent advancements in the synthesis and characterization of atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs) utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic processes aimed at converting CO2 into valuable C2+ chemicals. It also provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of developing efficient ADCs for the synthesis of value&#8208;added CO2&#8208;based C2+ products.








Abstract
The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added chemicals with two or more carbons (C2+) is a promising strategy that cannot only mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions but also reduce the excessive dependence on fossil feedstocks. In recent years, atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADCs), including single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and single&#8208;cluster catalysts (SCCs), emerged as attractive candidates for CO2 fixation reactions due to their unique properties, such as the maximum utilization of active sites, tunable electronic structure, the efficient elucidation of catalytic mechanism, etc. This review provides an overview of significant progress in the synthesis and characterization of ADCs utilized in photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, and thermocatalytic conversion of CO2 toward high&#8208;value C2+ compounds. To provide insights for designing efficient ADCs toward the C2+ chemical synthesis originating from CO2, the key factors that influence the catalytic activity and selectivity are highlighted. Finally, the relevant challenges and opportunities are discussed to inspire new ideas for the generation of CO2&#8208;based C2+ products over ADCs.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Thermosetting Resins: From Molecular Engineering to Intrinsically Multifunctional Customization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rich structural diversity of bio&#8208;based raw materials open unprecedented opportunities for various types of functional thermosetting resins inaccessible in conventional petrochemical&#8208;based materials. Recent advances in the field of functional bio&#8208;based thermosetting resins are presented, with a particular focus on molecular structures and design strategies for discovering functional properties.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in bio&#8208;based thermosetting resins in terms of environmental concerns and the desire for sustainable industrial practices. Beyond sustainability, utilizing the structural diversity of renewable feedstock to craft bio&#8208;based thermosets with customized functionalities is very worthy of expectation. There exist many bio&#8208;based compounds with inherently unique chemical structures and functions, some of which are even difficult to synthesize artificially. Over the past decade, great efforts are devoted to discovering/designing functional properties of bio&#8208;based thermosets, and notable progress have been made in antibacterial, antifouling, flame retardancy, serving as carbon precursors, and stimuli responsiveness, among others, largely expanding their application potential and future prospects. In this review, recent advances in the field of functional bio&#8208;based thermosets are presented, with a particular focus on molecular structures and design strategies for discovering functional properties. Examples are highlighted wherein functionalities are facilitated by the inherent structures of bio&#8208;based feedstock. Perspectives on issues regarding further advances in this field are proposed at the end.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the factors that affect the stability of anodes and discusses the corresponding strategies for prolonging the anode lifetime, including designing catalytic materials, electrolyte optimization, and electrolyzer design. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production is a sustainable and economical approach that can mitigate the energy crisis and global warming issues. Although various catalysts/electrodes with excellent activities have been developed for high&#8208;efficiency seawater electrolysis, their unsatisfactory durability, especially for anodes, severely impedes their industrial applications. In this review, attention is paid to the factors that affect the stability of anodes and the corresponding strategies for designing catalytic materials to prolong the anode's lifetime. In addition, two important aspects&#8212;electrolyte optimization and electrolyzer design&#8212;with respect to anode stability improvement are summarized. Furthermore, several methods for rapid stability assessment are proposed for the fast screening of both highly active and stable catalysts/electrodes. Finally, perspectives on future investigations aimed at improving the stability of seawater electrolysis systems are outlined.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Thermal Interface Materials: Structure, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) based on 2D materials like graphene/boron nitride, pivotal for heat management in advanced electronics. Focusing on their structural attributes, properties, and applications, it differentiates from other reviews by emphasizing their developmental history, addressing critical challenges, and proposing solutions. Additionally, it introduces other 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs, providing insights for future advancements.








Abstract
The challenges associated with heat dissipation in high&#8208;power electronic devices used in communication, new energy, and aerospace equipment have spurred an urgent need for high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) to establish efficient heat transfer pathways from the heater (chip) to heat sinks. Recently, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene and boron nitride, renowned for their ultrahigh basal&#8208;plane thermal conductivity and the capacity to facilitate cross&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;morphic structural design, have found widespread use as thermal fillers in the production of high&#8208;performance TIMs. To deepen the understanding of 2D material&#8208;based TIMs, this review focuses primarily on graphene and boron nitride&#8208;based TIMs, exploring their structures, properties, and applications. Building on this foundation, the developmental history of these TIMs is emphasized and a detailed analysis of critical challenges and potential solutions is provided. Additionally, the preparation and application of some other novel 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs are briefly introduced, aiming to offer constructive guidance for the future development of high&#8208;performance TIMs.

         <title>Recent Advances in Reversible Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carrier Systems: From Hydrogen Carriers to Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) are a novel approach for hydrogen storage with the merits of high hydrogen storage capacity, safety, and long&#8208;distance transportation. The recent significant advances of two components in one reversible LOHC system, namely as hydrogen carriers and catalysts, are summarized with comparatives. The current challenges and outlook of this promising technology are also described.








Abstract
Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs) have gained significant attention for large&#8208;scale hydrogen storage due to their remarkable gravimetric hydrogen storage capacity (HSC) and compatibility with existing oil and gas transportation networks for long&#8208;distance transport. However, the practical application of reversible LOHC systems has been constrained by the intrinsic thermodynamic properties of hydrogen carriers and the performances of associated catalysts in the (de)hydrogenation cycles. To overcome these challenges, thermodynamically favored carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, and catalytic procedures need to be developed. Here, significant advances in recent years have been summarized, primarily centered on regular LOHC systems catalyzed by homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts, including dehydrogenative aromatization of cycloalkanes to arenes and N&#8208;heterocyclics to N&#8208;heteroarenes, as well as reverse hydrogenation processes. Furthermore, with the development of metal complexes for dehydrogenative coupling, a new family of reversible LOHC systems based on alcohols is described that can release H2 under relatively mild conditions. Finally, views on the next steps and challenges in the field of LOHC technology are provided, emphasizing new resources for low&#8208;cost hydrogen carriers, high&#8208;performance catalysts, catalytic technologies, and application scenarios.

         <title>Designing Advanced Amorphous/Nanocrystalline Alloys by Controlling the Energy State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to the modification of composition and structure, the functional properties of amorphous alloys can be improved by changing the energy state. For example, superior catalytic performance, soft magnetism, thermal stability, and magnetocaloric effect can be achieved by designing proper energy states. The correlation between the relaxuns of enthalpy and different properties is reviewed.








Abstract
Amorphous alloys, also known as metallic glasses, exhibit many advanced mechanical, physical, and chemical properties. Owing to the nonequilibrium nature, their energy states can vary over a wide range. However, the energy relaxation kinetics are very complex and composed of various types that are coupled with each other. This makes it challenging to control the energy state precisely and to study the energy&#8208;properties relationship. This brief review introduces the recent progresses on studying the enthalpy relaxation kinetics during isothermal annealing, for example, the observation of two&#8208;step relaxation phenomenon, the detection of relaxation unit (relaxun), the key role of large activation entropy in triggering memory effect, the influence of glass energy state on nanocrystallization. Based on the above knowledge, a new strategy is proposed to design a series of amorphous alloys and their composites consisting of nanocrystals and glass matrix with superior functional properties by precisely controlling the nonequilibrium energy states. As the typical examples, Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with both advanced soft magnetism and good plasticity, Gd&#8208;based amorphous/nanocrystalline composites with large magnetocaloric effect, and Fe&#8208;based amorphous alloys with high catalytic performance are specifically described.

         <title>Tempospatially Confined Catalytic Membranes for Advanced Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review critically summarizes recent representative studies on catalytic membranes (CMs) for advanced water remediation, paying attention to both thermodynamics and mass transfer kinetics mechanism. A rational design framework of tempospatially confined CM is proposed initiatively, involving the materials selection, catalytic oxidation system selection, pore microstructure design according to the tempospatial confinement, CM fabrication, and application.








Abstract
The application of homogeneous catalysts in water remediation is limited by their excessive chemical and energy input, weak regenerability, and potential leaching. Heterogeneous catalytic membranes (CMs) offer a new approach to facilitate efficient, selective, and continuous pollutant degradation. Thus, integrating membranes and continuous filtration with heterogeneous advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) can promote thermodynamic and kinetic mass transfers in spatially confined intrapores and facilitate diffusion&#8208;reaction processes. Despite the remarkable advantages of heterogeneous CMs, their engineering application is practically restricted due to the fuzzy design criteria for specific applications. Herein, the recent advances in CMs for advanced water remediation are critically reviewed and the design flow for tempospatially confined CMs is proposed. Further, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art CM materials and their catalytic mechanisms are reviewed, after which the tempospatial confinement mechanisms comprising the nanoconfinement effect, interface effect, and kinetic mass transfer are emphasized, thus clarifying their roles in the construction and performance optimization of CMs. Additionally, the fabrication methods for CMs based on their catalysts and pore sizes are summarized and an overview of their application and performance evaluations is presented. Finally, future directions for CMs in materials research and water treatment, are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) featured with synergetic water&#8208;repellent, stable, and enhanced solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion properties, remarkably broaden the water&#8208;related application field. This review presents a timely introduction to the recent progress in synergetic functions, mechanisms, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium, providing general guidance for advancing future development of stable and high&#8208;efficient SSTMs.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion is a direct and effective way to absorb sunlight for heat via the rational design and control of photothermal materials. However, when exposed to water&#8208;existed conditions, the conventional solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal performance may experience severe degradation owing to the high specific heat capacity of water. To tackle with the challenge, the water&#8208;repellent function is introduced to construct superhydrophobic solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal materials (SSTMs) for achieving stable heating, and even, for creating new application possibilities under water droplets, sweat, seawater, and ice environments. An in&#8208;depth review of cutting&#8208;edge research of SSTMs is given, focusing on synergetic functions, typical construction methods, and cutting&#8208;edge potentials based on water medium. Moreover, the current challenges and future prospects based on SSTMs are also carefully discussed.

         <title>Bioinspired Slippery Surfaces for Liquid Manipulation from Tiny Droplet to Bulk Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired slippery surfaces, which originate in nature and possess unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion, have broad application prospects in liquid manipulation from tiny droplets to bulk liquid, such as water collection, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, drag&#8208;reduction, anti&#8208;icing, and anticorrosion.








Abstract
Slippery surfaces, which originate in nature with special wettability, have attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and practical applications in a variety of fields due to their unique characteristics of superlow liquid friction and adhesion. Although research on bioinspired slippery surfaces is still in its infancy, it is a rapidly growing and enormously promising field. Herein, a systematic review of recent progress in bioinspired slippery surfaces, beginning with a brief introduction of several typical creatures with slippery property in nature, is presented. Subsequently,this review gives a detailed discussion on the basic concepts of the wetting, friction, and drag from micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;aspects and focuses on the underlying slippery mechanism. Next, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in three categories of slippery surfaces of air&#8208;trapped, liquid&#8208;infused, and liquid&#8208;like slippery surfaces, including materials, design principles, and preparation methods, are summarized and the emerging applications are highlighted. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects of various slippery surfaces are addressed.

         <title>Towards the 10&#8208;Year Milestone of Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have attracted significant attention for their potential to surpass the single&#8208;junction Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit. This review highlights the milestones and advancements in monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. It covers research progress and challenges, and provides a roadmap for developing efficient, scalable, and stable tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell represents one of the most promising avenues for exceeding the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells at a reasonable cost. Remarkably, its efficiency has rapidly increased from 13.7% in 2015 to 34.6% in 2024. Despite the significant research efforts dedicated to this topic, the &#8220;secret&#8221; to achieving high&#8208;performance perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells seems to be confined to a few research groups. Additionally, the discrepancies in preparation and characterization between single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells continue to impede the transition from efficient single&#8208;junction to efficient tandem solar cells. This review first revisits the key milestones in the development of monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells over the past decade. Then, a comprehensive analysis of the background, advancements, and challenges in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is provided, following the sequence of the tandem fabrication process. The progress and limitations of the prevalent stability measurements for tandem devices are also discussed. Finally, a roadmap for designing efficient, scalable, and stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is outlined. This review takes the growth history into consideration while charting the future course of perovskite/silicon tandem research.

         <title>2D Conjugated Polymer Thin Films for Organic Electronics: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) featuring extended &#960;&#8208;conjugation, tailored electronic properties, and ordered structure have attracted extensive attention in organic electronics. This review summarises the recent advances in interfacial synthesis strategies, conductivity properties, and organic electronics applications of 2DCP thin films. Design principles and future research direction for full&#8208;conjugated 2DCP thin films for organic electronics are also discussed.








Abstract
2D conjugated polymers (2DCPs) possess extended in&#8208;plane &#960;&#8208;conjugated lattice and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, which results in enhanced electronic performance and potentially unique band structures. These properties, along with predesignability, well&#8208;defined channels, easy postmodification, and order structure attract extensive attention from material science to organic electronics. In this review, the recent advance in the interfacial synthesis and conductivity tuning strategies of 2DCP thin films, as well as their application in organic electronics is summarized. Furthermore, it is shown that, by combining topology structure design and targeted conductivity adjustment, researchers have fabricated 2DCP thin films with predesigned active groups, highly ordered structures, and enhanced conductivity. These films exhibit great potential for various thin&#8208;film organic electronics, such as organic transistors, memristors, electrochromism, chemiresistors, and photodetectors. Finally, the future research directions and perspectives of 2DCPs are discussed in terms of the interfacial synthetic design and structure engineering for the fabrication of fully conjugated 2DCP thin films, as well as the functional manipulation of conductivity to advance their applications in future organic electronics.

         <title>From Charge to Spin: An In&#8208;Depth Exploration of Electron Transfer in Energy Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinctive physical properties associated with charge and spin afford a novel paradigm for catalyst design, challenging conventional linear scaling relationships in the realm of energy conversion. This departure from traditional approaches not only holds the potential to revolutionize asymmetric synthesis but also offers a unique perspective on unraveling the elusive origins of homochirality.








Abstract
Catalytic materials play crucial roles in various energy&#8208;related processes, ranging from large&#8208;scale chemical production to advancements in renewable energy technologies. Despite a century of dedicated research, major enduring challenges associated with enhancing catalyst efficiency and durability, particularly in green energy&#8208;related electrochemical reactions, remain. Focusing only on either the crystal structure or electronic structure of a catalyst is deemed insufficient to break the linear scaling relationship (LSR), which is the golden rule for the design of advanced catalysts. The discourse in this review intricately outlines the essence of heterogeneous catalysis reactions by highlighting the vital roles played by electron properties. The physical and electrochemical properties of electron charge and spin that govern catalysis efficiencies are analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the pronounced influence of external fields in perturbing the LSR, underscoring the vital role that electron spin plays in advancing high&#8208;performance catalyst design. The review culminates by proffering insights into the potential applications of spin catalysis, concluding with a discussion of extant challenges and inherent limitations.

         <title>DNA Nanomaterial&#8208;Empowered Surface Engineering of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As natural intercellular transporters, extracellular vesicles (EVs) show great potential as diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic agents, and drug delivery vehicles. DNA nanomaterials provide an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, programmable approach to design and construct sophisticated molecular devices on the EV surface for EV isolation, analysis, and delivery.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell&#8208;secreted biological nanoparticles that are critical mediators of intercellular communication. They contain diverse bioactive components, which are promising diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Their nanosized membrane&#8208;bound structures and innate ability to transport functional cargo across major biological barriers make them promising candidates as drug delivery vehicles. However, the complex biology and heterogeneity of EVs pose significant challenges for their controlled and actionable applications in diagnostics and therapeutics. Recently, DNA molecules with high biocompatibility emerge as excellent functional blocks for surface engineering of EVs. The robust Watson&#8211;Crick base pairing of DNA molecules and the resulting programmable DNA nanomaterials provide the EV surface with precise structural customization and adjustable physical and chemical properties, creating unprecedented opportunities for EV biomedical applications. This review focuses on the recent advances in the utilization of programmable DNA to engineer EV surfaces. The biology, function, and biomedical applications of EVs are summarized and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art achievements in EV isolation, analysis, and delivery based on DNA nanomaterials are introduced. Finally, the challenges and new frontiers in EV engineering are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have both excellent stability and continuously broken&#8208;through efficiencies. Herein, the characteristics of inverted PSCs including each functional layers, interfacial regulation strategies, and device stability are summarized. Meanwhile, the applications of inverted structure in tandem and flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules are introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges and several proposals of PSCs are put forward.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted widespread research and commercialization attention because of their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low fabrication cost. The long&#8208;term stability of PSCs should satisfy industrial requirements for photovoltaic devices. Inverted PSCs with a p&#8208;i&#8208;n architecture exhibit considerable advantages because of their excellent stability and competitive efficiency. The continuously broken&#8208;through PCE of inverted PSCs shows huge application potential. This review summarizes the developments and outlines the characteristics of inverted PSCs including charge transport layers (CTLs), perovskite compositions, and interfacial regulation strategies. The latest effective CTLs, interfacial modification, and stability promotion strategies especially under light, thermal, and bias conditions are emphatically analyzed. Furthermore, the applications of the inverted structure in high&#8208;efficiency and stable tandem, flexible photovoltaic devices, and modules and their main obstacles are systematically introduced. Finally, the remaining challenges faced by inverted devices are discussed, and several directions for advancing inverted PSCs are proposed according to their development status and industrialization requirements.

         <title>Advances in Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics: Flexible Transparent Electrodes and Deformable Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems. This work provides an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs. The recent advances in stretchable OPVs are elaborated, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices.








Abstract
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems owing to their superior robustness under repetitive tensile strains and their good compatibility. However, reconciling a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency and a reasonable flexibility is a tremendous challenge. In addition, the development of stretchable OPVs must be accelerated to satisfy the increasing requirements of niche markets for mechanical robustness. Stretchable OPV devices can be classified as either structurally or intrinsically stretchable. This work reviews recent advances in stretchable OPVs, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices. Initially, an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs is provided. Subsequently, research into flexible and stretchable transparent electrodes that directly affect the performances of stretchable OPVs is summarized and analyzed. Overall, this review aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the intrinsic properties of highly efficient and deformable active materials, while also emphasizing advanced strategies for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility of the active layer, including material design, multi&#8208;component settings, and structural optimization.

A brain&#8211;neuromorphics interface (BNI) is of profound implications for restoring or augmenting human's capabilities. This review profiles the recent progresses on neuromorphic electronics with both energy&#8208;efficiency and bio&#8208;fidelity characteristics toward such interface. Challenges and prospects are also summarized, which can provide guidance for promoting the development of the seamless, bidirectional, and compact tools for bridging humans and machines.








Abstract
Brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCIs) that enable human&#8211;machine interaction have immense potential in restoring or augmenting human capabilities. Traditional BCIs are realized based on complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technologies with complex, bulky, and low biocompatible circuits, and suffer with the low energy efficiency of the von Neumann architecture. The brain&#8211;neuromorphics interface (BNI) would offer a promising solution to advance the BCI technologies and shape the interactions with machineries. Neuromorphic devices and systems are able to provide substantial computation power with extremely high energy&#8208;efficiency by implementing in&#8208;materia computing such as in situ vector&#8211;matrix multiplication (VMM) and physical reservoir computing. Recent progresses on integrating neuromorphic components with sensing and/or actuating modules, give birth to the neuromorphic afferent nerve, efferent nerve, sensorimotor loop, and so on, which has advanced the technologies for future neurorobotics by achieving sophisticated sensorimotor capabilities as the biological system. With the development on the compact artificial spiking neuron and bioelectronic interfaces, the seamless communication between a BNI and a bioentity is reasonably expectable. In this review, the upcoming BNIs are profiled by introducing the brief history of neuromorphics, reviewing the recent progresses on related areas, and discussing the future advances and challenges that lie ahead.

         <title>Targeting Compact and Ordered Emitters by Supramolecular Dynamic Interactions for High&#8208;performance Organic Ambient Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compact and ordered RTP emitters exhibit superior phosphorescent performance compared with disordered counterparts, thus greatly extending the applications. This review presents a timely introduction to the fundamental concepts and recent progress in design and preparation strategies, optical properties, underlying luminescent mechanisms and applications, providing general guidance for advancing future development of high&#8208;performance RTP materials.








Abstract
Purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials have received intense attention due to their fascinating optical properties and advanced optoelectronic applications. The promotion of intersystem crossing (ISC) and minimalization of nonradiative dissipation under ambient conditions are key prerequisites for realizing high&#8208;performance organic RTP; However, the ISC process is generally inefficient for organic fluorogens and the populated triplet excitons are always too susceptible to be well stabilized by conventional means. Particularly, organizing organic fluorophores into compact and ordered entities by supramolecular dynamic interactions has proven to be a newly&#8208;emerged strategy to boost the ISC process greatly and suppress the non&#8208;radiative relaxations immensely, facilitating the population and stabilization of triplet excitons to access high&#8208;performance organic RTP. Consequently, well&#8208;defined organic emitters enable robust RTP emission even in the solution state, thus greatly extending the applications. Here, this review is focused on a timely and brief introduction to recent progress in tailoring ordered high&#8208;performance RTP emitters by supramolecular dynamic interactions. Their typical preparation strategies, optoelectronic properties, and applications are thoroughly summarized. In the summary section, key challenges and perspectives of this field are highlighted to suggest potential directions for future study.

Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) hold a higher metal atom loading and provide greater flexibility in terms of the structural characteristics of their active sites in comparison to single&#8208;atom catalysts. Consequently, DACs hold great promise for achieving improved catalytic performance. This article aims to provide a focused overview of the latest advancements in DACs, covering their synthesis and mechanisms in reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, which plays a key role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. The discussion starts by highlighting the structures of DACs and the differences in diatomic coordination induced by various substrates. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies of DACs for oxygen electrocatalysis are discussed from several different perspectives. It particularly highlights the challenges of increasing the diatomic loading capacity. More importantly, the main focus of this overview is to investigate the correlation between the configuration and activity in DACs in order to gain a deeper understanding of their active roles in oxygen electrocatalysis. This will be achieved through density functional theory calculations and sophisticated in situ characterization technologies. The aim is to provide guidelines for optimizing and upgrading DACs in oxygen electrocatalysis. Additionally, the overview discusses the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving area of research.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural and its Downstream Chemicals: A Review of Catalytic Routes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 37, September 12, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass is crucial for sustainability, owing to its abundance and eco&#8208;friendliness. As a bio&#8208;based platform compound derived from sugar, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) enables the creation of high&#8208;value derivatives for further producing biopolymers, biofuels, and beyond. This review delves into efficient catalytic routes and economic feasibility of HMF synthesis and conversion, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.








Abstract
Biomass assumes an increasingly vital role in the realm of renewable energy and sustainable development due to its abundant availability, renewability, and minimal environmental impact. Within this context, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from sugar dehydration, stands out as a critical bio&#8208;derived product. It serves as a pivotal multifunctional platform compound, integral in synthesizing various vital chemicals, including furan&#8208;based polymers, fine chemicals, and biofuels. The high reactivity of HMF, attributed to its highly active aldehyde, hydroxyl, and furan ring, underscores the challenge of selectively regulating its conversion to obtain the desired products. This review highlights the research progress on efficient catalytic systems for HMF synthesis, oxidation, reduction, and etherification. Additionally, it outlines the techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and prospective research directions for the production of furan&#8208;based chemicals. Despite significant progress in catalysis research, and certain process routes demonstrating substantial economics, with key indicators surpassing petroleum&#8208;based products, a gap persists between fundamental research and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This is due to the lack of comprehensive engineering research on bio&#8208;based chemicals, making the commercialization process a distant goal. These findings provide valuable insights for further development of this field.

Abstract
2D nanomaterials, with extraordinary physical and chemical characteristics, have long been regarded as promising nanofillers in organic coatings for marine corrosion protection. The past decade has witnessed the high&#8208;speed progress of 2D nanomaterial&#8208;reinforced organic composite coatings, and plenty of breakthroughs have been achieved as yet. This review covers an in&#8208;depth and all&#8208;around outline of the up&#8208;to&#8208;date advances in 2D nanomaterial&#8208;modified organic coatings employed for the marine corrosion protection realm. Starting from a brief introduction to 2D nanomaterials, the preparation strategies and properties are illustrated. Subsequently, diverse protection models based on composite coatings for marine corrosion protection are also introduced, including physical barrier, self&#8208;healing, as well as cathodic protection, respectively. Furthermore, computational simulations and critical factors on the corrosion protection properties of composite coatings are clarified in detail.

Among the broad range of thermoelectric materials, silver copper chalcogenides (AgCuQ, Q = S, Se, Te) have garnered significant attention in thermoelectric community in light of inherently ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, controllable electronic transport properties, excellent thermoelectric performance across various temperature ranges, and a degree of ductility. This review epitomizes the recent progress in AgCuQ-based thermoelectric materials, from the optimization of thermoelectric performance to the rational design of devices, encompassing the fundamental understanding of crystal structures, electronic band structures, mechanical properties, and quasi-liquid behaviors. The correlation between chemical composition, mechanical properties, and thermoelectric performance in this material system is also highlighted. Finally, several key issues and prospects are proposed for further optimizing AgCuQ-based thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Smart stimuli&#8208;responsive persistent luminescence materials, combining the various advantages and frontier applications prospects, have gained booming progress in recent years. The trap&#8208;controlled property and energy storage capability to respond to external multi&#8208;stimulations through diverse luminescence pathways make them attractive in emerging multi&#8208;responsive smart platforms. This review aims at the recent advances in trap&#8208;controlled luminescence materials for advanced multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive smart platforms. The design principles, luminescence mechanisms, and representative stimulations, i.e., thermo&#8208;, photo&#8208;, mechano&#8208;, and X&#8208;rays responsiveness, are comprehensively summarized. Various emerging multi&#8208;responsive hybrid systems containing trap&#8208;controlled luminescence materials are highlighted. Specifically, temperature dependent trapping and de&#8208;trapping performance is discussed, from extreme&#8208;low temperature to ultra&#8208;high temperature conditions. Emerging applications and future perspectives are briefly presented. It is hoped that this review would provide new insights and guidelines for the rational design and performance manipulation of multi&#8208;responsive materials for advanced smart platforms.

         <title>Binary&#8208;Cooperative Ultrathin Porous Membrane for Gas Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate framework (g&#8208;ZIF) nanoparticles are synthesized by a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, and the resulting defect&#8208;free membranes are obtained via spin&#8208;coating and thermal treatment. The membrane is constructed with g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles and stacked cross&#8208;linking boundaries, which form dual channels with fast gas transport and molecular sieving. The membrane performance is stable under 3.0 MPa.








Abstract
The construction of ultrathin porous membranes with stable structures is critical for achieving efficient gas separation. Inspired by the binary&#8208;cooperative structural features of bones and teeth&#8212;composed of rigid hydroxyapatite and flexible collagen, which confer excellent mechanical strength&#8212;a binary&#8208;cooperative porous membrane constructed with gel&#8208;state zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (g&#8208;ZIFs), synthesized using a metal&#8208;gel&#8208;induced strategy, is proposed. The enlarged cavity size and flexible frameworks of the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles significantly improve gas adsorption and diffusion, respectively. After thermal treatment, the coordination structures forming rigid segments in the g&#8208;ZIF membranes appear at the stacked g&#8208;ZIF boundaries, exhibiting a higher Young's modulus than the g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles, denoted as the flexible segments. The g&#8208;ZIF membranes demonstrate excellent tensile and compression resistances, attributed to the effective translation of binary&#8208;cooperative effects of rigidity and flexibility into the membranes. The resulting dual&#8208;aperture structure, composed of g&#8208;ZIF nanoparticles surrounded by nanoscale apertures at the boundaries, yields a membrane with a stable CO2 permeance of 4834 GPU and CO2/CH4 selectivity of 90 within 3.0&#160;MPa.

         <title>Cascaded Heteroporous Nanocomposites for Thermo&#8208;Adaptive Passive Radiation Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cascaded heteroporous nanocomposite films with multistage optical scattering exhibit excellent subambient radiative cooling performance, achieving an enhanced average emissivity of 96.5% within the atmospheric window and a high reflectivity of 97.3% in the sunlight spectra. Combined with phase transition properties, these films possess thermal dissipation and absorption capabilities, effectively counteracting thermal shocks in device heating systems.








Abstract
Passive radiative cooling is a promising technology for heat dissipation that does not consume energy. However, current radiative cooling materials can only exhibit subambient cooling under atmospheric conditions and struggle to process specific heat accumulation. Thus, a passive thermal regulation mechanism adapted to wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range applications is required to match device heating systems. Herein, a heteroporous nanocomposite film (HENF) with thermo&#8208;adaptive radiation cooling performance is reported. Compared to conventional porous cooling films with limited scattering efficiencies, the HENFs with multistage scattering have a strong emissivity of 96.5% (8&#8211;13&#160;&#181;m) and a high reflectivity of 97.3% (0.3&#8211;2.5&#160;&#181;m), resulting in an ultrahigh cooling power of 114&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2. In such HENFs, theoretical analyses have confirmed the spectrum management superiority of the heteroporous unit in terms of the scattering efficiency strength, with their cascading effect enhancing the overall film&#8208;cooling efficiency. The high mechanical performance, phase&#8208;transition features, and environmental adaptive properties of HENFs are also exhibited. Importantly, HENFs synergistically couple thermal dissipation and absorption to effectively process heat accumulation and counteract thermal shock in heating devices. It is anticipated that thermo&#8208;adaptive HENFs will act as a promising platform for device surface thermal regulation over a wide temperature range.

         <title>Plant&#8208;Based Shape Memory Cryogel for Hemorrhage Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As the call for eco&#8208;friendly healthcare solutions rises, the novel, energy&#8208;efficient biosafe pollen cryogels answer the call&#8208;crafted without toxic crosslinkers, they offer impressive shape&#8208;memory, strong mechanical resilience, and high biocompatibility. They stand out as a potential medical game&#8208;changer for healing deep, noncompressible wounds.








Abstract
The escalating global demand for sustainable manufacturing, motivated by concerns over energy conservation and carbon footprints, encounters challenges due to insufficient renewable materials and arduous fabrication procedures to fulfill specific requirements in medical and healthcare systems. Here, biosafe pollen cryogel is engineered as effective hemostats without additional harmful crosslinkers to treat deep noncompressible wounds. A straightforward and low&#8208;energy approach is involved in forming stable macroporous cryogel, benefiting from the unique micro&#8208;hierarchical structures and chemical components of non&#8208;allergenic plant pollen. It is demonstrated that the pollen cryogel exhibits rapid water/blood&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;memory properties within 2 s. Owing to their inherent nano/micro hierarchical structure and abundant chemical functional groups on the pollen surface, the pollen cryogel shows effective hemostatic performance in a mouse liver penetration model, which is easily removed after usage. Overall, the self&#8208;crosslinking pollen cryogel in this work pioneers a framework of potential clinical applications for the first&#8208;hand treatment on deep noncompressible wounds.

         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free nanowelding between 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide ferroelectric semiconductor nanoplates is achieved by perfectly aligning their crystalline orientations using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with the assistance of the anisotropic lubricity between the nanoplates and a graphene substrate.

Nanowelding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom&#8208;designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, a new technique is reported based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, 1D movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8211;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterward to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

         <title>A Straightforward Solvent&#8208;Pair&#8208;Enabled Multicomponent Coassembly Approach toward Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Nanoparticle&#8208;Decorated Mesoporous Tungsten Oxide for Trace Ammonia Sensing</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (namely Pt/N&#8208;mWO3, Rh/N&#8208;mWO3, Pd/N&#8208;mWO3) are straightforwardly synthesized through a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly strategy. The obtained Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 materials have ordered mesoporous structure with ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles, rich oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces, exhibiting superior ammonia sensing performances with a low limit of detection (51.2 ppb).








Abstract
The straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated ordered mesoporous transition metal oxides remains a great challenge due to the difficulty of balancing the interactions between precursors and templates. Herein, a solvent&#8208;pair&#8208;enabled multicomponent coassembly (SPEMC) strategy is developed for straightforward synthesis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated nitrogen&#8208;doped ordered mesoporous tungsten oxide (abbreviated as NM/N&#8208;mWO3, NM&#160;=&#160;Pt, Rh, Pd). The amphiphilic poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS) copolymers coassemble with ammonium metatungstate (AMT) clusters and different kinds of hydrophilic noble metal precursors without phase separation. SPEMC synthesis requires no direct interaction between PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS and AMT, thus the assembly equilibriums between noble metal precursors and PEO&#8208;b&#8208;PS can be readily controlled. The obtained NM/N&#8208;mWO3 nanocomposites possess ordered mesopores, abundant oxygen vacancies, and metal&#8211;metal oxide interfaces. As a result, the Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensors exhibit superior ammonia sensing performances with high sensitivity, an ultralow limit of detection (51.2 ppb), good selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that ammonia is oxidized stepwise to NO, NO2&#8722;, and NO3&#8722; during the sensing process. Moreover, a portable wireless module based on Pt/N&#8208;mWO3 sensor can recognize ppm&#8208;level concentration of ammonia, which lays a solid foundation for its application in various fields.

         <title>Jellyfish&#8208;Inspired Artificial Spider Silk for Luminous Surgical Sutures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, the luminous artificial spider silks are prepared by employing highly hydrated segments and polyhydroxyl segments. Furthermore, a luminescent surgical suture is prepared by coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.








Abstract
The development of functional surgical sutures with excellent mechanical properties, good fluorescence, and high cytocompatibility is highly required in the field of medical surgeries. Achieving fibers that simultaneously exhibit high mechanical robustness, good spinnability, and durable fluorescence emission has remained challenging up to now. Taking inspiration from the spinning process of spider silk and the luminescence mechanism of jellyfish, this work reports a luminous artificial spider silk prepared with the aim of balancing the fiber spinnability and mechanical robustness. This is realized by employing highly hydrated segments with aggregation&#8208;induced luminescence for enhancing the fiber spinnability and polyhydroxyl segments for increasing the fiber mechanical robustness. Twist insertion during fiber spinning improves the fiber strength, toughness, and fluorescence emission. Furthermore, coating the fiber with an additional polymer layer results in a &#8220;sheath&#8211;core&#8221; architecture with improved mechanical properties and capacity to withstand water. This work provides a new design strategy for performing luminescent and robust surgical sutures.

         <title>Extremely Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Unusual Axial Diamagnetism in a Quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall effect is observed in quasi&#8208;1D Dirac Material La3MgBi5. The obtained anomalous Hall conductivity is the largest one in the current anomalous Hall effect systems. Especially, the absence of magnetic elements makes La3MgBi5 one of the few non&#8208;magnetic materials that can exhibit anomalous Hall effect.








Abstract
Anomalous Hall effect (AHE), one of the most important electronic transport phenomena, generally appears in ferromagnetic materials but is rare in materials without magnetic elements. Here, a study of La3MgBi5 is presented, whose band structure carries multitype Dirac fermions. Although magnetic elements are absent in La3MgBi5, the signals of AHE can be observed. In particular, the anomalous Hall conductivity is extremely large, reaching 42,356 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 with an anomalous Hall angle of 8.8%, the largest one that has been observed in the current AHE systems. The AHE is suggested to originate from the combination of skew scattering and Berry curvature. Another unique property discovered in La3MgBi5 is the axial diamagnetism. The diamagnetism is significantly enhanced and dominates the magnetization in the axial directions, which is the result of the restricted motion of the Dirac fermion at the Fermi level. These findings not only establish La3MgBi5 as a suitable platform to study AHE and quantum transport but also indicate the great potential of 315&#8208;type Bi&#8208;based materials for exploring novel physical&#160;properties.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Locked WS2 Vortex Emission via Photonic Crystal Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field in the momentum space, which strongly interacts with the exciton emission from 1L WS2. Consequently, spin&#8208;dependent twisted spiral phase fronts are imposed on the exciton emission from 1L WS2, exhibiting helical wavefronts and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profiles in the momentum space.









Abstract
Owing to their strong exciton effects and valley polarization properties, monolayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (1L TMDs) have unfolded the prospects of spin&#8208;polarized light&#8208;emitting devices. However, the wavefront control of exciton emission, which is critical to generate structured optical fields, remains elusive. In this work, the experimental demonstration of spin&#8208;locked vortex emission from monolayer Tungsten Disulfide (1L WS2) integrated with Silicon Nitride (SiNx) PhC slabs is presented. The symmetry&#8208;protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) in the SiNx PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field distribution in the momentum space with a topological singularity in the center of the Brillouin zone, which imposes the resonantly enhanced WS2 exciton emission with a spin&#8208;correlated spiral phase front by taking advantage of the winding topologies of resonances with the assistance of geometric phase scheme. As a result, exciton emission from 1L WS2 exhibits helical wavefront and doughnut&#8208;shaped intensity beam profile in the momentum space with topological charges locked to the spins of light. This strategy on spin&#8208;dependent excitonic vortex emission may offer the unparalleled capability of valley&#8208;polarized structured light generation for 1L TMDs.

     alt="Spin-Locked WS2 Vortex Emission via Photonic Crystal Bound States in the Continuum"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum in the SiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field in the momentum space, which strongly interacts with the exciton emission from 1L WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, spin-dependent twisted spiral phase fronts are imposed on the exciton emission from 1L WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibiting helical wavefronts and doughnut-shaped intensity beam profiles in the momentum space.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their strong exciton effects and valley polarization properties, monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (1L TMDs) have unfolded the prospects of spin-polarized light-emitting devices. However, the wavefront control of exciton emission, which is critical to generate structured optical fields, remains elusive. In this work, the experimental demonstration of spin-locked vortex emission from monolayer Tungsten Disulfide (1L WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) integrated with Silicon Nitride (SiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) PhC slabs is presented. The symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BIC) in the SiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; PhC slabs engender azimuthal polarization field distribution in the momentum space with a topological singularity in the center of the Brillouin zone, which imposes the resonantly enhanced WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exciton emission with a spin-correlated spiral phase front by taking advantage of the winding topologies of resonances with the assistance of geometric phase scheme. As a result, exciton emission from 1L WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits helical wavefront and doughnut-shaped intensity beam profile in the momentum space with topological charges locked to the spins of light. This strategy on spin-dependent excitonic vortex emission may offer the unparalleled capability of valley-polarized structured light generation for 1L TMDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spin&#8208;Glass States Generated in a van der Waals Magnet by Alkali&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na atoms are intercalated into the van der Waals (vdW) gaps of Cr2Ge2Te6 where magnetic frustration is discovered and leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order, confirmed by characteristic signature in ac magnetic susceptibility. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.








Abstract
Tuning magnetic properties in layered van der Waals (vdW) materials has captured significant attention due to the efficient control of ground states by heterostructuring and external stimuli. Electron doping by electrostatic gating, interfacial charge transfer, and intercalation is particularly effective in manipulating the exchange and spin&#8208;orbit properties, resulting in a control of Curie temperature (TC) and magnetic anisotropy. Here, an uncharted role of intercalation is discovered to generate magnetic frustration. As a model study, Na atoms are intercalated into the vdW gaps of pristine Cr2Ge2Te6 (CGT) where generated magnetic frustration leads to emerging spin&#8208;glass states coexisting with a ferromagnetic order. A series of dynamic magnetic susceptibility measurements/analysis confirms the formation of magnetic clusters representing slow dynamics with a distribution of relaxation times. The intercalation also modifies other macroscopic physical parameters including the significant enhancement of TC from 66 to 240&#160;K and the switching of magnetic easy&#8208;hard axis direction. This study identifies intercalation as a unique route to generate emerging frustrated spin states in simple vdW crystals.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active metasurfaces are emerging as a new avenue for creating compact, high&#8208;performance reconfigurable optical devices. This study demonstrates a non&#8208;volatile transmissive metafilter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs deposited on a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 microheater. The metafilter can be electrically switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using no mechanical movements with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB.








Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free&#8208;space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non&#8208;mechanical, non&#8208;volatile transmissive filter based on low&#8208;loss PCMs with a 200 &#215; 200 &#181;m2 switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low&#8208; and high&#8208;transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free&#8208;space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.

         <title>All&#8208;Oxide Metasurfaces Formed by Synchronized Local Ionic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrokinetics is revealed during ionic gating and a new concept of synchronized local ionic gating is introduced, enabling local manipulation of electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of numerous nano&#8208;regions over a large area in SrCoO2.5 thin films in addition to the electrical formation of all&#8208;oxide metasurfaces.








Abstract
Ionic gating of oxide thin films has emerged as a novel way of manipulating the properties of thin films. Most studies are carried out on single devices with a three&#8208;terminal configuration,&#160;but, by exploring the electrokinetics during the ionic gating, such a configuration with initially insulating films leads to a highly non&#8208;uniform gating response of individual devices within large arrays of the devices. It is shown that such an issue can be circumvented by the formation of a uniform charge potential by the use of a thin conducting underlayer. This synchronized local ionic gating allows for the simultaneous manipulation of the electrical, magnetic, and/or optical properties of large arrays of devices. Designer metasurfaces formed in this way from SrCoO2.5 thin films display an anomalous optical reflection of light that relies on the uniform and coherent response of all the devices. Beyond oxides, almost any material whose properties can be controlled by the addition or removal of ions via gating can form novel metasurfaces using this technique. These findings provide insights into the electrokinetics of ionic gating and a wide range of applications using synchronized local ionic gating.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect Breaks the pH Dependence in Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;distorted TiOxFy catalyst is developed with a strengthened pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, which can regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst, the microenvironment at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and consequently the absorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, leading to significant pH&#8208;resistant properties for two&#8208;electrode oxygen electroreduction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
The hydrogenation of small molecules (like O2 and CO2) often exhibits strong activity dependence on pHs because of discrepant proton donor environments. However, some catalysts can show seldom dependence on two&#8208;electron oxygen electroreduction, a sustainable route of O2 hydrogenation to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In this work, a pH&#8208;resistant oxygen electroreduction system arising from the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect is demonstrated. Thorough operando Raman spectra, local environment analyses and density function theory simulations, the lattice distortion of TiOxFy that introduces the pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect contributing to regulating local pHs at electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces and the absorption/desorption of key *OOH intermediate is revealed. Consequently, as comparison to 78.6% activity attenuation for common catalyst, the TiOxFy displays minor activity decay (3.2%) in the pH range of 1&#8211;13 with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies (93.4&#8211;96.4%) and H2O2 yield rates (595&#8211;614&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) in the current densities of 100&#8211;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Further techno&#8208;economics analyses display the H2O2 production cost dependent on pHs, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.37&#160;kg&#8722;1. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to pseudo&#8208;Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that leverages systems beyond traditional conception.

Consequently, as comparison to 78.6% activity attenuation for common catalyst, the TiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; displays minor activity decay (3.2%) in the pH range of 1&#8211;13 with remarkable Faradaic efficiencies (93.4&#8211;96.4%) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rates (595&#8211;614&#160;mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in the current densities of 100&#8211;1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Further techno-economics analyses display the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production cost dependent on pHs, giving the lowest H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; price of $0.37&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The present finding is expected to provide an additional dimension to pseudo-Jahn&#8211;Teller effect that leverages systems beyond traditional conception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multistate Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual triazatruxene (TAT) molecules forming a honeycomb lattice on Ag(111) can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.








Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step toward the realization of novel logic and memory devices. This paper reports on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules can be controlled, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. The low&#8208;bias switching behavior is explored in active units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules that are purposefully defined (programmed) by high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. Within such a unit the low&#8208;bias switching can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single TAT molecule, demonstrating up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled molecules, respectively. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to bias&#8208;dependent hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as full reversibility, make this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory systems.

         <title>Boosting All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells by Revitalizing the Buried Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acetylcholine acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; aiding in the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly improving the overall quality of the top narrow&#8208;bandgap mixed tin&#8211;lead perovskite layers. As a result, single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells and their 2&#8208;terminal tandems achieve stabilized power conversion efficiencies of 22.98% and 27.54%, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) serve as crucial top subcells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs). However, the prevalent use of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) hole transport layers (HTLs) in NBG PSCs compromises device efficiency and stability. To address this, the study proposes a revitalizing strategy for the buried interface of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites by directly immersing acetylcholine chloride (ACh) into PEDOT: PSS. ACh acts as a proficient &#8220;diver,&#8221; not only modulating the bottom PEDOT: PSS HTLs but also facilitating the reconstruction of the buried interface and significantly enhancing the quality of the top perovskite layers. This intervention with ACh prevents Sn2+ oxidation, mitigates buried defects, and encourages the growth of large, densely packed grains within Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Consequently, the optimized NBG PSCs exhibit significantly improved hole transport and reduced carrier recombination, achieving a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 22.98% with enhanced stability. Furthermore, these optimized NBG Sn&#8208;Pb cells enable highly efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs, boasting steady&#8208;state efficiencies of 27.54% (certified at 26.41%) and 28.01%, respectively. This study emphasizes the importance of optimizing NBG PSCs through buried interface reconstruction, propelling the advancement of all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Printed All&#8208;Carbon Responsive Material and Soft Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a new carbon&#8208;based responsive material that unlocks the unexpectedly high vapor response speed of 9400&#176; s&#8722;1 as well as excellent enviroment tolerance. Based on this, an innovative somersaulting robot with locomotion velocity close to the level of animals is designed and constructed, representing a milestone towards achieving life&#8208;like performance in biomimetic soft robots.








Abstract
Responsive materials and actuators are the basis for the development of various leading&#8208;edge technologies but have so far mostly been designed based on polymers, incurring key limitations related to sensitivity and environmental tolerance. This work reports a new responsive material, laser&#8208;printed carbon film (LPCF), produced via direct laser transformation of a liquid organic precursor and consists of graphitic and amorphous carbons. The high activity of amorphous carbon combined with the dual&#8208;gradient structure enables the LPCF to have a actuation speed of 9400&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1 in response to the stimulus of organic vapor. LPCF exhibits a conductivity of 950&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1 and excellent resistance to various extreme environmental conditions, which are unachievable for polymer&#8208;based materials. Additionally, an LPCF&#8208;based all&#8208;carbon soft robot that can mimic the complex continuous backward somersaulting motions without manual intervention is constructed. The locomotion velocity of the robot reaches a value of 1.19&#160;BL&#160;s&#8722;1, which is almost one to two orders of magnitude faster than that of reported soft robots. This work not only offers a new paradigm for highly responsive materials but also provides a great design and engineering example for the next generation of biomimetic robots with life&#8208;like performance.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Large&#8208;Scale, 3D, and Stretchable Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;LSC enables the fabrication of large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits. Soft copper&#8208;clad laminates and multiple types of VIAs are employed to create large&#8208;scale planar interconnects and vertical interconnects. A temporary bonding strategy is proposed to mitigate misalignment with residual and thermal strains. 3D&#8208;LSC facilitates batch production of miniaturized multifunctional devices and the fabrication of large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have demonstrated excellent potential in wearable healthcare and conformal integration. Achieving the scalable fabrication of stretchable devices with high functional density is the cornerstone to enable the practical applications of stretchable electronics. Here, a comprehensive methodology for realizing large&#8208;scale, 3D, and stretchable circuits (3D&#8208;LSC) is reported. The soft copper&#8208;clad laminate (S&#8208;CCL) based on the &#8220;cast and cure&#8221; process facilitates patterning the planar interconnects with the scale beyond 1 m. With the ability to form through, buried and blind VIAs in the multilayer stack of S&#8208;CCLs, high functional density can be achieved by further creating vertical interconnects in stacked S&#8208;CCLs. The application of temporary bonding substrate effectively minimizes the misalignments caused by residual strain and thermal strain. 3D&#8208;LSC enables the batch production of stretchable skin patches based on five&#8208;layer stretchable&#160;circuits, which can serve as a miniaturized system for physiological signals monitoring with wireless power delivery. The fabrications of conformal antenna and stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode display further illustrate the potential of 3D&#8208;LSC in realizing large&#8208;scale stretchable devices.

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine (III)&#8208;Based Complexation for Chiroptical Supramolecular Glass, Deep Eutectic Solvent and Luminescent Switch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents are achieved by the biaxial type halogen bonded complexation, which also appends light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.








Abstract
Hypervalent iodine(III) have widely been utilized for organic synthetic reagents. They are also recognized as positive charge&#8208;assisted, exceptionally robust biaxial halogen bond donors, while their potential in supramolecular materials is barely explored. This work reports a cyclic diaryliodonium ion as biaxial halogen bonding donor that displays remarkable binding affinity toward phenanthroline or acridine acceptors with chiral pendants. Biaxial halogen bonding enables chiroptical evolution in solution, allowing for rational control over supramolecular chirality. Leveraging their strong binding affinity, the halogen bonding complexes manifested amorphous properties and deep eutectic behavior in the solid state. Capitalizing on these attributes, this work achieves the successful preparation of supramolecular glasses and deep eutectic solvents. Additionally, halogen bonding appended light irradiation&#8208;triggered luminescence through a hydrogen atom transfer process, showing applications in anti&#8208;counterfeit and display.

         <title>Gold Nanoparticle Transport in the Injured Kidneys with Elevated Renal Function Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray imaging to track the kidney transport of renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles, the study finds that inner strip of outer medulla is the most significant site in accumulating glomerular filtered nanoparticles in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidney: formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the lumen of the loop of Henle increases as proximal tubular injury progresses, which is undetectable by renal function biomarkers BUN and creatinine in mild injury stages.








Abstract
Renal function biomarkers such as serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) serve as key indicators for guiding clinical decisions before administering kidney&#8208;excreted small&#8208;molecule agents. With engineered nanoparticles increasingly designed to be renally clearable to expedite their clinical translation, understanding the relationship between renal function biomarkers and nanoparticle transport in diseased kidneys becomes crucial to their biosafety in future clinical applications. In this study, renal&#8208;clearable gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are used as X&#8208;ray contrast agents to noninvasively track their transport and retention in cisplatin&#8208;injured kidneys with varying BUN and Cr levels. The findings reveal that AuNP transport is significantly slowed in the medulla of severely injured kidneys, with BUN and Cr levels elevated to 10 times normal. In mildly injured kidneys, where BUN and Cr levels only four to five times higher than normal, AuNP transport and retention are not predictable by BUN and Cr levels but correlate strongly with the degree of tubular injury due to the formation of gold&#8211;protein casts in the Henle's loop of the medulla. These results underscore the need for caution when employing renal&#8208;clearable nanomedicines in compromised kidneys and highlight the potential of renal&#8208;clearable AuNPs as X&#8208;ray probes for&#160;assessing kidney injuries noninvasively.

         <title>A Long&#8208;Range Planar Polymer with Efficient &#960;&#8208;Electron Delocalization for Superior Proton Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel polymer material with a planar imine&#8208;rich configuration is developed, in which the overall molecular rigidity, efficient &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization, and optimized electronic structure endow the polymer material with a rapid, ultra&#8208;stable and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage capability. For real applications, an all&#8208;organic aqueous proton battery (APB) is constructed with high energy/power density and an ultralong lifespan of over 30&#160;000 cycles.








Abstract
Due to the unique &#8220;Grotthus mechanism&#8221;, aqueous proton batteries (APBs) are promising energy devices with intrinsic safety and sustainability. Although polymers with tunable molecular structures are ideal electrode materials, their unsatisfactory proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors hinder the practical application in APB devices. Herein, a novel planar phenazine (PPHZ) polymer with a robust and extended imine&#8208;rich skeleton is synthesized and used for APB application for the first time. The long&#8208;range planar configuration achieves ordered molecular stacking and reduced conformational disorder, while the high conjugation with strong &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization optimizes energy bandgap and electronic properties, enabling the polymer with low proton diffusion barriers, high redox activity, and superior electron affinity. As such, the PPHZ polymer as an electrode material exhibits fast, stable, and unrivaled proton&#8208;storage redox behaviors with a large capacity of 273.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 (1 C) in 1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte, which is the highest value among proton&#8208;inserted electrodes in aqueous acidic electrolytes. Dynamic in situ techniques confirm the high redox reversibility upon proton uptake/removal, and the corresponding protonation pathways are elucidated by theoretical calculations. Moreover, a pouch&#8208;type APB cell using PPHZ electrode exhibits an ultralong lifespan over 30&#160;000 cycles, further verifying its promising application prospect.

         <title>Gold Nanocluster: A Photoelectric Converter for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Activated Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold nanocluster triggers platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrugs activation through direct electron transfer from the excited state of the gold nanocluster to the Pt(IV) center under X&#8208;ray radiation, circulating the limitation of indirect reactive species that easily quenched in living tumor cells. This spatiotemporally synchronous radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy offers excellent antitumor performance, and leads to superior outcomes for combined treatment.








Abstract
Despite the promise of activatable chemotherapy, the development of a spatiotemporally controllable strategy for prodrug activation in deep tissues remains challenging. Herein, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept is proposed for a gold nanocluster&#8208;based strategy that utilizes X&#8208;ray irradiation to trigger the liberation of platinum (Pt)&#8208;based prodrug conjugates, thus enabling radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy. Mechanistically, the irradiated activation of prodrugs is achieved through direct photoelectron transfer from the excited&#8208;state gold nanoclusters to the Pt(IV) center, resulting in the release of cytotoxic Pt(II) agents. Compared to the traditional combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, this radiotherapy&#8208;directed chemotherapy strategy offers superior antitumor efficacy and safety benefits through spatiotemporal synergy at the tumor site. Additionally, this strategy elicits robust immunogenic cell death and yields profound outcomes for combined immunotherapy of breast cancer. This versatile strategy is ushering in a new era of radiation&#8208;mediated chemistry for controlled drug delivery and the precise regulation of biological processes.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomesh Enables Cellular&#8208;Resolution, Elastic Neuroelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The results presented here provide multifunctional materials, fabrication, and microsystem strategies establishing foundations for elastic neuroelectronics, where conventional thin&#8208;film&#8208;based electrode materials make stretchable microelectrodes through in&#8208;plane nanomesh structuring, achieving unparalleled scalability down to cellular resolution and reliable elasticity. Detailed in vivo studies suggest the ability of these devices to provide tissue&#8208;conforming, high&#8208;quality interfaces with individual neurons in intact nervous tissues.








Abstract
Silicone&#8208;based devices have the potential to achieve an ideal interface with nervous tissue but suffer from scalability, primarily due to the mechanical mismatch between established electronic materials and soft elastomer substrates. This study presents a novel approach using conventional electrode materials through multifunctional nanomesh to achieve reliable elastic microelectrodes directly on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone with an unprecedented cellular resolution. This engineered nanomesh features an in&#8208;plane nanoscale mesh pattern, physically embodied by a stack of three thin&#8208;film materials by design, namely Parylene&#8208;C for mechanical buffering, gold (Au) for electrical conduction, and Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for improved electrochemical interfacing. Nanomesh elastic neuroelectronics are validated using single&#8208;unit recording from the small and curvilinear epidural surface of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with device self&#8208;conformed and superior recording quality compared to plastic control devices requiring manual pressing is demonstrated. Electrode scaling studies from in vivo epidural recording further revealed the need for cellular resolution for high&#8208;fidelity recording of single&#8208;unit activities and compound action potentials.

     alt="Multifunctional Nanomesh Enables Cellular-Resolution, Elastic Neuroelectronics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results presented here provide multifunctional materials, fabrication, and microsystem strategies establishing foundations for elastic neuroelectronics, where conventional thin-film-based electrode materials make stretchable microelectrodes through in-plane nanomesh structuring, achieving unparalleled scalability down to cellular resolution and reliable elasticity. Detailed in vivo studies suggest the ability of these devices to provide tissue-conforming, high-quality interfaces with individual neurons in intact nervous tissues.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicone-based devices have the potential to achieve an ideal interface with nervous tissue but suffer from scalability, primarily due to the mechanical mismatch between established electronic materials and soft elastomer substrates. This study presents a novel approach using conventional electrode materials through multifunctional nanomesh to achieve reliable elastic microelectrodes directly on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) silicone with an unprecedented cellular resolution. This engineered nanomesh features an in-plane nanoscale mesh pattern, physically embodied by a stack of three thin-film materials by design, namely Parylene-C for mechanical buffering, gold (Au) for electrical conduction, and Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) for improved electrochemical interfacing. Nanomesh elastic neuroelectronics are validated using single-unit recording from the small and curvilinear epidural surface of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) with device self-conformed and superior recording quality compared to plastic control devices requiring manual pressing is demonstrated. Electrode scaling studies from in vivo epidural recording further revealed the need for cellular resolution for high-fidelity recording of single-unit activities and compound action potentials. In addition to creating a minimally invasive device to effectively interface with DRG sensory afferents at a single-cell resolution, this study establishes nanomeshing as a practical pathway to leverage traditional electrode materials for a new class of elastic neuroelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Versatile Method of Engineering the Band Alignment and the Electron Wavefunction Hybridization of Hybrid Quantum Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The versatile approach is fully compatible with the lithography processes to create an atomically connected interface and effectively modulate the band alignment at the interface. This method is also generic for other materials and will ultimately result in the desirable requirements for topological and Andreev devices.








Abstract
Hybrid devices that combine superconductors (S) and semiconductors (Sm) have attracted great attention due to the integration of the properties of both materials, which relies on the interface details and the resulting coupling strength and wavefunction hybridization. However, until now, none of the experiments have reported good control of the band alignment of the interface, as well as its tunability to the coupling and hybridization. Here, the interface is modified by inducing specific argon milling while maintaining its high quality, e.g., atomic connection, which results in a large induced superconducting gap and ballistic transport. By comparing with Schr&#246;dinger&#8211;Poisson calculations, it is proven that this method can vary the band bending/coupling strength and the electronic spatial distribution. In the strong coupling regime, the coexistence and tunability of crossed Andreev reflection and elastic co&#8208;tunneling&#8212;key ingredients for the Kitaev chain&#8212;are confirmed. This method is also generic for other materials and achieves a hard and huge superconducting gap in lead and indium antimonide nanowire (Pb&#8208;InSb) devices. Such a versatile method, compatible with the standard fabrication process and accompanied by the well&#8208;controlled modification of the interface, will definitely boost the creation of more sophisticated hybrid devices for exploring physics in solid&#8208;state systems.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Engineered ZnIn2S4 Nanosheets for Harnessing Low&#8208;Frequency Vibration Induced Piezoelectric Polarization Coupled with Static Dipole Field to Enhance Photocatalytic H2 Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces vacancy&#8208;engineered ZnIn2S4 nanosheets with improved photocatalytic H2 production efficiency under low&#8208;frequency vibrations. By creating indium (In) and sulfur (S) vacancies, the voltage gradient within the sheet is increased due to a higher dipole moment and enhanced piezoelectric properties. This results in better charge separation post&#8208;light absorption, significantly boosting H2 production.








Abstract
This study investigates the impact of In&#8208; and S&#8208;vacancy concentrations on the photocatalytic activity of non&#8208;centrosymmetric zinc indium sulfide (ZIS) nanosheets for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A positive correlation between the concentrations of dual In and S vacancies and the photocatalytic HER rate over ZIS nanosheets is observed. The piezoelectric polarization, stimulated by low&#8208;frequency vortex vibration to ensure the well&#8208;dispersion of ZIS nanosheets in solution, plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic HER over the dual&#8208;vacancy engineered ZIS nanosheets. The piezoelectric characteristic of the defective ZIS nanosheets is confirmed through the piezopotential response measured using piezoelectric force microscopy. Piezophotocatalytic H2 evolution over the ZIS nanosheets is boosted under accelerated vortex vibrations. The research explores how vacancies alter ZIS's dipole moment and piezoelectric properties, thereby increasing electric potential gradient and improving charge&#8208;separation efficiency, through multi&#8208;scale simulations, including Density Functional Theory and Finite Element Analysis, and a machine&#8208;learning interatomic potential for defect identification. Increased In and S vacancies lead to higher electric potential gradients in ZIS along [100] and [010] directions, attributing to dipole moment and the piezoelectric effect. This research provides a comprehensive exploration of vacancy engineering in ZIS nanosheets, leveraging the piezopotential and dipole field to enhance photocatalytic performances.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Defect Modification Through Oily&#8208;Allicin Modified Buried Interface Achieving Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oily Allicin is introduced into perovskite solar cells to achieve grain wrapping under different stressors, which promotes defect contact and prevents ionic migration. A power conversion efficiency of 25.07% with an FF (fill factor) of 84.03% is achieved, which reaches 93.16% of the FF S&#8211;Q limit.








Abstract
The buried interface properties of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a crucial role in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. The metal&#8208;oxide/perovskite heterogeneous interfaces are highly defective and cause serious ion migration. However, the buried and unexposed bottom interface and simultaneous stabilization of grain boundaries receive less attention and effective solutions. To tackle this problem, a solid&#8211;liquid strategy is employed by introducing oily&#8208;additive allicin at the buried interface to passivate the shallow (VI and Vo) and deep traps (VPb and PbI). Interestingly, oily status allicin fills the pinholes at the heterointerface and wraps the perovskite grains, suppressing the ion migration during the photoaging process. As a result, an outstanding PCE of 25.07% is achieved with a remarkable fill factor (FF) of 84.03%. The modified devices can maintain 94.51% of the original PCE after light soaking under 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1000&#160;h. This work demonstrates a buried interface modification method that employs an eco&#8208;friendly additive, which helps promote the development of PSCs with high performance and stability.

         <title>Embedded Skyrmion Bags in Thin Films of Chiral Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the first experimental observations of magnetic skyrmion bags embedded within skyrmion lattices in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe. By utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of embedded skyrmion bags, which remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields, is observed directly. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided.








Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are topologically nontrivial spin configurations that possess particle&#8208;like properties. Earlier research has mainly focused on a specific type of skyrmion with topological charge Q = &#8722;1. However, theoretical analyses of 2D chiral magnets have predicted the existence of skyrmion bags&#8212;solitons with arbitrary positive or negative topological charge. Although such spin textures are metastable states, recent experimental observations have confirmed the stability of isolated skyrmion bags in a limited range of applied magnetic fields. Here, by utilizing Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, the extraordinary stability of skyrmion bags in thin plates of B20&#8208;type FeGe is shown. In particular, it is shown that skyrmion bags embedded within a skyrmion lattice remain stable even in zero or inverted external magnetic fields. A robust protocol for nucleating such embedded skyrmion bags is provided. The results agree perfectly with micromagnetic simulations and establish thin plates of cubic chiral magnets as a powerful platform for exploring a broad spectrum of topological magnetic&#160;solitons.

         <title>Automated Synthesis of DNA Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this contribution, the first automated, solid&#8208;phase synthesis of DNA nanomaterials is presented, achieved via the prototype DNA nanoassembler system. This methodology enables the production of sequence&#8208;controlled custom DNA nanotubes through self&#8208;assembly. Combining single&#8208;molecule kinetics and photobleaching experiments, microfluidic assembly, and automated data screening, the construction strategy relies on the sequential hybridization of DNA modules at room temperature onto a solid support.








Abstract
DNA nanotechnology has revolutionized the ability to position matter at the nanoscale, but the preparation of DNA&#8208;based architectures remains laborious. To facilitate the formation of custom structures, a fully automated method is reported to produce sequence&#8208; and size&#8208;defined DNA nanotubes. By programming the sequential addition of desired building blocks, rigid DX&#8208;tile&#8208;based DNA nanotubes and flexible wireframe DNA structures are attained, where the total number of possible constructs increases as a power function of the number of different units available. Using single&#8208;molecule fluorescence imaging, the kinetics and yield of each synthetic step can be quantitatively determined, revealing differences in self&#8208;assembly dynamics as the nanotube is built up from the solid support and providing new insights into DNA self&#8208;assembly. The exploitation of automation for both assembly and analysis (through an ad&#8208;hoc developed K&#8208;means clustering algorithm) facilitates a workflow wherein the synthesis parameters may be iteratively improved upon, demonstrating how a single&#8208;molecule &#8220;assembly&#8208;analysis&#8208;optimization&#8221; sequence can be used to generate complex, noncovalent materials in good yield. The presented synthetic strategy is generalizable, making use of equipment already available in most standard laboratories and represents the first fully automated supramolecular assembly on a solid support.

         <title>Design and Synthesis of Electrocatalysts Base on Catalysis&#8208;Unit Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative approach is presented using catalysis units, simplifying material design from trial&#8208;and&#8208;error to an assembly&#8208;like process. Through Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning (ML), a structure&#8208;performance relationship is established. Integration catalysis units into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) demonstrates Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF as promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work proposes a streamlined strategy, potentially integrating DFT, ML, and experimental section for efficient functional materials development.








Abstract
It is a pressing need to develop new energy materials to address the existing energy crisis. However, screening optimal targets out of thousands of material candidates remains a great challenge. Herein, an alternative concept for highly effective materials screening based on dual&#8208;atom salphen catalysis units, is proposed and validated. Such an approach simplifies the design of catalytic materials and reforms the trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimental model into a building&#8208;blocks&#8208;assembly like process. First, density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed on a series of potential catalysis units that are possible to synthesize. Then, machine learning (ML) is employed to define the structure&#8208;performance relationship and acquire chemical insights. Afterward, the projected catalysis units are integrated into covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to validate the concept Electrochemical tests confirming that Ni&#8208;SalphenCOF and Co&#8208;SalphenCOF are promising conductive agent&#8208;free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. This work provides a fast&#8208;tracked strategy for the design and development of functional materials, which serves as a potentially workable framework for seamlessly integrating DFT calculations, ML, and experimental approaches.

         <title>Controlled Migration of Lithium Cations by Diamine Bridges in Water&#8208;Processable Polymer&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte Memory Layers for Organic Synaptic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Forming molecular bridges between water&#8208;soluble polymer chains widens chain distances leading to the reduced conductivity of lithium cations. This controlled migration of ions delivers pronounced hysteresis characteristics in organic transistors, which can mimic the action of biological synapses. The present organic synaptic transistors with the controlled ion migration layers can proceed with neural computing processes at an accuracy of 96%.








Abstract
Synaptic transistors require sufficient retention (memory) performances of current signals to exactly mimic biological synapses. Ion migration has been proposed to achieve high retention characteristics but less attention has been paid to polymer&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for organic synaptic transistors (OSTRs). Here, OSTRs with water&#8208;processable polymer&#8208;based SSEs, featuring ion migration&#8208;controllable molecular bridges, which are prepared by reactions of poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonic acid) (PSSA), diethylenetriamine (DETA), and lithium hydroxide (LiOH) are demonstrated. The ion conductivity of PSSA:LiOH:DETA (1:0.4:X, PLiD) films is remarkably changed by the molar ratio (X) of DETA, which is attributed to the extended distances between the PSSA chains by the DETA bridges. The devices with the PLiD layers deliver noticeably changed hysteresis reaching an optimum at X = 0.2, leading to the longest retention of current signals upon single/double pulses. The long&#8208;term potentiation test confirms that the present OSTRs can gradually build up the postsynaptic current by gate pulses of &#8722;2&#160;V, while the long&#8208;term depression can be adjusted by varying the depression gate pulses (&#8776;0.2&#8211;1.2&#160;V). The artificial neural network simulations disclose that the present OSTRs with the ion migration&#8208;controlled PLiD layers can perform synaptic processes with an accuracy of &#8776;96%.

         <title>Hole&#8208;Carrier&#8208;Dominant Transport in 2D Single&#8208;Crystal Copper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic nature of transport is presented by hole carriers in 2D copper without grain boundaries. Twin boundaries almost do not scatter electrons. The hidden hole&#8208;like properties of 2D copper can only be unmasked by thorough removal of grain boundaries. The existence of hole carriers is revealed in 2D copper through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and nonlinear Hall effect measurements.








Abstract
In 2D noble metals like copper, the carrier scattering at grain boundaries has obscured the intrinsic nature of electronic transport. However, it is demonstrated that the intrinsic nature of transport by hole carriers in 2D copper can be revealed by growing thin films without grain boundaries. As even a slight deviation from the twin boundary is perceived as grain boundaries by electrons, it is only through the thorough elimination of grain boundaries that the hidden hole&#8208;like attribute of 2D single&#8208;crystal copper can be unmasked. Two types of Fermi surfaces, a large hexagonal Fermi surface centered at the zone center and the triangular Fermi surface around the zone corner, tightly matching to the calculated Fermi surface topology, confirmed by angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and vivid nonlinear Hall effects of the 2D single&#8208;crystal copper account for the presence of hole carriers experimentally. This breakthrough suggests the potential to manipulate the majority carrier polarity in metals by means of grain boundary engineering in a 2D geometry.

         <title>Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near&#8208;room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr3.








Abstract
CsPbBr3 exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr3 quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large&#8208;area ferroelectric CsPbBr3 crystals.

     alt="Near Room Temperature Solvothermal Growth of Ferroelectric CsPbBr3 Nanoplatelets with Ultralow Dark Current"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplatelets with exceptional optical properties and ultralow dark current are synthesized via a near-room temperature solvothermal method by enhancing precursor solubility in alcohol. These nanoplatelets, with dimensions in the tens of micrometers, show potential for use in advanced optoelectronic devices, including optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics, by combining ferroelectricity with the inherent properties of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding optoelectronic properties and thermal stability, making it a coveted material for detectors, light-emitting diodes, and solar cells. Despite observations of ferroelectricity in CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots, synthesizing bulk ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals has remained elusive, hindering its potential in next-generation optoelectronic devices like optical switches and ferroelectric photovoltaics. Here, a breakthrough is reported: a novel solvothermal technique enabling the growth of ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoplatelets with lateral dimensions in the tens of micrometers. This represents a significant step toward achieving large-area ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals. Unlike traditional methods, this approach allows for growth and crystallization of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in alcohol solutions by enhancing precursor solubility. This study confirms the ferroelectric nature of these nanoplatelets using second harmonic generation, electrical characterizations, and piezoresponse force microscopy. This work paves the way for utilizing ferroelectric CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in novel optoelectronic devices, significantly expanding the potential of this material and opening doors for further exploration in this exciting field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Memristive Crossbar Array&#8208;Based Probabilistic Graph Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) using Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors. C&#8208;PGM expresses uncertainties in graph data through device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations, enabling fast processing and large&#8208;scale implementation of probabilistic units. This model demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy in applications like steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm compared to conventional methods.








Abstract
Modern graph datasets with structural complexity and uncertainties due to incomplete information or data variability require advanced modeling techniques beyond conventional graph models. This study introduces a memristive crossbar array (CBA)&#8208;based probabilistic graph model (C&#8208;PGM) utilizing Cu0.3Te0.7/HfO2/Pt memristors, which exhibit probabilistic switching, self&#8208;rectifying, and memory characteristics. C&#8208;PGM addresses the complexities and uncertainties inherent in structural graph data across various domains, leveraging the probabilistic nature of memristors. C&#8208;PGM relies on the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation across multiple memristive CBAs, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that rely on sequential operations, which are slower and have a reliability concern due to repeated switching. This new approach enables the fast processing and massive implementation of probabilistic units at the expense of chip area. In this study, the hardware&#8208;based C&#8208;PGM feasibly expresses small&#8208;scale probabilistic graphs and shows minimal error in aggregate probability calculations. The probability calculation capabilities of C&#8208;PGM are applied to steady&#8208;state estimation and the PageRank algorithm, which is implemented on a simulated large&#8208;scale C&#8208;PGM. The C&#8208;PGM&#8208;based steady&#8208;state estimation and PageRank algorithm demonstrate comparable accuracy to conventional methods while significantly reducing computational costs.

         <title>Long&#8208;Term Culture of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells in Xeno&#8208;Free Condition Using Functional Polymer Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylicacrylate) (pGC2), engineered for human pluripotent stem cells cultivation. pGC2 supports robust growth of human pluripotent stem cells, maintaining stemness and pluripotency for up to ten passages, while offering cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. Comprehensive evaluations confirm its wide adaptability and potential for clinical translation in stem cell&#8208;based therapies.








Abstract
Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), encompassing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), hold immense potential in regenerative medicine, offering new opportunities for personalized cell therapies. However, their clinical translation is hindered by the inevitable reliance on xenogeneic components in culture environments. This study addresses this challenge by engineering a fully synthetic, xeno&#8208;free culture substrate, whose surface composition is tailored systematically for xeno&#8208;free culture of hPSCs. A functional polymer surface, pGC2 (poly(glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;grafting&#8208;guanidine&#8208;co&#8208;carboxylic acrylate)), offers excellent cell&#8208;adhesive properties as well as non&#8208;cytotoxicity, enabling robust hESCs and hiPSCs growth while presenting cost&#8208;competitiveness and scalability over Matrigel. This investigation includes comprehensive evaluations of pGC2 across diverse experimental conditions, demonstrating its wide adaptability with various pluripotent stem cell lines, culture media, and substrates. Crucially, pGC2 supports long&#8208;term hESCs and hiPSCs expansion, up to ten passages without compromising their stemness and pluripotency. Notably, this study is the first to confirm an identical proteomic profile after ten passages of xeno&#8208;free cultivation of hiPSCs on a polymeric substrate compared to Matrigel. The innovative substrate bridges the gap between laboratory research and clinical translation, offering a new promising avenue for advancing stem cell&#8208;based therapies.

         <title>Piezoelectric Analgesia Blocks Cancer&#8208;Induced Bone Pain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This polyvinylpyrrolidone modified Aurivillius structure BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs) are synthesized via a hydrothermal process. Ultrasound can trigger BIONSs to generate local electrical field, internalizing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) rapidly and substantially decreasing the expression of TRPV1. With the reduction of TRPV1, the Ca2+ signal in spinal neuron is obviously decreased and the activity of wide range dynamic neurons is inhibited, accompanying the reduction of some neuropeptides and the change of inflammatory cytokines, resulting cancer induced bone pain relief for up to 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The manipulation of cell surface receptors&#8217; activity will open a new frontier for drug development and disease treatment. However, limited by the desensitization of drugs, effective physical intervention strategy remains challenging. Here, the controllable internalization of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) on neural cells by local piezoelectric field is reported. Single&#8208;cell&#8208;level local electric field is construct by synthesizing piezoelectric BiOIO3 nanosheets (BIONSs). Upon a mild ultrasound of 0.08&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, an electric field of 15.29&#160;&#181;V is generated on the surface of BIONSs, further inducing TRPV1 internalization in 5&#160;min. The as&#8208;downregulated TRPV1 expression results in the reduction of Ca2+ signal in a spinal neuron and the inhibition of the activity of wide range dynamic neurons, therefore effectively preventing the transmission of cancer&#8208;induced bone pain (CIBP). This strategy not only charts a new course for CIBP alleviation, but also introduces a promising nanotechnology for regulating cell surface receptors, showing significant potential in neuropathological and receptor&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Unraveling Anomalies in Preferential Liquid Transport through the Intrinsic Pores of Cyclodextrin in Polyester Nanofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The acyl chloride crosslinked macrocyclic&#8208;&#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin&#8208;based polyester nanofilm composite membranes result in membranes with high water permeance and superior ion&#8208;sieving capabilities. Polar aggregate pores in the nanofilm facilitate water permeation while the intrinsic cyclodextrin cavity does not contribute to liquid permeation, enabling selective permeation of polar liquids with extremely high permeance selectivity of &gt;500 and diminishes the existence of Janus pathways.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of the porous structure of the nanofiltration membrane is critical for unlocking enhanced separation efficiencies across various liquids and solutes. Ultrathin films of crosslinked macrocycles, specifically cyclodextrins (CDs), have drawn considerable attention in this area owing to their ability to facilitate precise molecular separation with high liquid permeance for both polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, resembling Janus membranes. However, the functional role of the intrinsic cavity of CD in liquid transport remains inadequately understood, demanding immediate attention in designing nanofiltration membranes. Here, the synthesis of polyester nanofilms derived from crosslinked &#946;&#8208;CD, demonstrating remarkable Na2SO4 rejection (&#8776;92 &#8211; 99.5%), high water permeance (&#8776;4.4 &#8211; 37.4 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), extremely low hexane permeance (&lt;1 Lm&#8722;2h&#8722;1bar&#8722;1), and extremely high ratio (&#945; &gt; 500) of permeances for polar and non&#8208;polar liquids, is reported. Molecular simulations support the findings, indicating that neither the polar nor the non&#8208;polar liquids flow through the &#946;&#8208;CD cavity in the nanofilm. Instead, liquid transport predominantly occurs through the 2.2&#160;nm hydrophilic aggregate pores. This challenges the presumed functional role of macrocyclic cavities in liquid transport and raises questions about the existence of the Janus structure in nanofiltration membranes produced from the macrocyclic monomers.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precise manipulation of the porous structure of the nanofiltration membrane is critical for unlocking enhanced separation efficiencies across various liquids and solutes. Ultrathin films of crosslinked macrocycles, specifically cyclodextrins (CDs), have drawn considerable attention in this area owing to their ability to facilitate precise molecular separation with high liquid permeance for both polar and non-polar liquids, resembling Janus membranes. However, the functional role of the intrinsic cavity of CD in liquid transport remains inadequately understood, demanding immediate attention in designing nanofiltration membranes. Here, the synthesis of polyester nanofilms derived from crosslinked &#946;-CD, demonstrating remarkable Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; rejection (&#8776;92 &#8211; 99.5%), high water permeance (&#8776;4.4 &#8211; 37.4 Lm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), extremely low hexane permeance (&amp;lt;1 Lm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;bar&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and extremely high ratio (&#945; &amp;gt; 500) of permeances for polar and non-polar liquids, is reported. Molecular simulations support the findings, indicating that neither the polar nor the non-polar liquids flow through the &#946;-CD cavity in the nanofilm. Instead, liquid transport predominantly occurs through the 2.2&#160;nm hydrophilic aggregate pores. This challenges the presumed functional role of macrocyclic cavities in liquid transport and raises questions about the existence of the Janus structure in nanofiltration membranes produced from the macrocyclic monomers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates for the first time the efficient generation of orbital current from CoPt alloy. This work quantifies the transport properties of the orbital currents from CoPt alloy and show that the performance of orbitronic terahertz emitters exceeds the spintronic counterpart. This work provides a new route for the developing orbitronic information devices.








Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, this work reports a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, this work confirms that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

         <title>Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Local High&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes for Advanced Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compatibility issue of acetonitrile (AN) with lithium metal is tackled by introducing a novel approach&#8212;a locally high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) as a diluent (LAT&#8208;0.5:1:2). The electrolyte demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability, flame retardancy, and wettability. Based on Cryo&#8208;EM characterization and theoretical simulations, the underlying mechanism of the AN&#8208;based LHCE from both the respects of solvation and SEI structures has been revealed.








Abstract
Acetonitrile (AN) is a compelling electrolyte solvent for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging batteries, but its reductive instability makes it incompatible with lithium metal anodes (LMAs). Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether (TTE) is used as the diluent to build an AN&#8208;based local high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE) to realize dense, dendrite&#8208;free, and stable LMAs. Such LHCE exhibits an exceptional electrochemical stability window close to 6&#160;V (vs Li+/Li), excellent wettability, and promising flame retardancy. Compared to a baseline carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, its electrochemical performance is prominent: the overpotential of lithium nucleation is minimal (only 24&#160;mV), the average half&#8208;cell coulombic efficiency (CE) reaches 99.5% at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and its practicality in full cells with LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathodes is also demonstrated. Compounding factors are identified to decipher the superiority of the AN&#8208;based LHCE. From the respect of solvation structures, both the elimination of free AN molecule and the diluent separation would contribute to prevention of anodic AN decomposition. Based on cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) characterization and theoretical simulations results, the produced solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer is uniform and compact. Thus, this work demonstrates a successful application of AN&#8208;based electrolytes in LMAs&#8212;traditionally deemed impractical&#8212;via the combined regulation of solvation and SEI structures.

         <title>Realization of Two&#8208;Dimensional Intrinsic Polar Metal in a Buckled Honeycomb Binary Lattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Buckled AB honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry belongs to polar space group P3m1, is proposed to be a promising candidate hosting topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity. Here, the successful realization of a IV&#8208;V binary compound on Ag (111) surface via molecular beam epitaxy, is reported. Strikingly, polarity and metallicity are found to coexist in the 2D buckled SiP monolayer.








Abstract
Structural topology and symmetry of a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) network play pivotal roles in defining its electrical properties and functionalities. Here, a binary buckled honeycomb lattice with C3v symmetry, which naturally hosts topological Dirac fermions and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity, is proposed. It is successfully achieved in a group IV&#8208;V compound, namely monolayer SiP epitaxially grown on Ag(111) surface. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations with angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, the degeneration of the Dirac nodal lines to points due to the broken horizonal mirror symmetry is elucidated. More interesting, the SiP monolayer manifests metallic nature, which is mutually exclusive with polarity in conventional materials. It is further found that the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarity is strongly suppressed by the metallic substrate. This study not only represents a breakthrough of realizing intrinsic polarity in 2D metallic material via ingenious design but also provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay of many exotic low&#8208;dimensional quantum phenomena.

         <title>Rational Design of Color&#8208;Pure Blue Organic Emitters by Poly&#8208;Heteroaromatic Omni&#8208;Delocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;pure blue emitters are in great demand for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light emitting diodes displays. Here, a simple and clear concept to design such emitters is presented. The application of this concept allows to derive a new structural motif, which is used to synthesize novel color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant blue hue.









Abstract
Current research on organic light emitters which utilize multiple resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF)&#160;materials is gaining significant interest because of the materials&#8217; ability to efficiently generate color&#8208;pure blue emission. However, the underlying reasons for high color purity remain unclear. It is shown here that these emitters share a common electronic basis, which is deduced from resonance structure considerations following Clar's rule, and which is termed as &#8220;poly&#8208;heteroaromatic omni&#8208;delocalization&#8221; (PHOD). The simple and clear design rules derived from the PHOD concept allow extending the known chemical space by new structural motifs. Based on PHOD, a set of novel high&#8208;efficiency color&#8208;pure emitters with brilliant deep&#8208;blue hue is specifically designed.

         <title>Rare&#8208;Earth (R) In&#8208;Plane Ordering in Novel (Mo, R, Nb)4AlC3 Quinary o&#8208;MAX Nanolaminates and their 2D Derivatives</title>

         <dc:description>
In the history of MAX phase, in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered configurations are reported for n = 1 and n &#8805; 2 in Mn+1AlCn separately. Here, starting from the (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX, the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;)MAX phase is synthesized with simultaneous R in&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering and Mo/Nb out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;ordering. The Pt&#8208;anchored 2D s&#8208;MXene shows supreme HER performance.








Abstract
Nanolamellar transition metal carbides are gaining increasing attentions because of the promising application in energy storage of their 2D derivatives. There are in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane atomic ordered occupations, which is thought to only be formed in separated systems due to totally different origins and crystallographic structure. In present work, starting from (Mo, Nb)4AlC3 o&#8208;MAX phase where out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation is experimentally and theoretically proved for Mo/Nb atoms, rare&#8208;earth elements (R = Y, Gd&#8208;Tm, Lu) are introduced, and the novel Mo3.33&#8208;xR0.67NbxAlC3 (x = 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, and 2.5) super&#8208;ordered (s&#8208;) MAX phase is synthesized, where R is ordered at the outer layer in the strict stoichiometry meanwhile Mo/Nb maintains the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ordered occupation. By R introduction, s&#8208;MAX is easier to be delaminated to obtain the s&#8208;MXene with the topochemical ordered vacancies, leading into the enhanced supercapacitance of 114.9 F g&#8722;1 in Mo1.33Nb2C3 s&#8208;MXene compared with 95.1 F g&#8722;1 in Mo2Nb2C3 o&#8208;MXene. By Pt anchoring, very low overpotential of 22&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved for HER applications. This study demonstrates a novel variety of s&#8208;MAX phase and seeks to inspire further exploration of the ordered MAX and MXene families.

         <title>Highly Luminescent Shell&#8208;Less Indium Phosphide Quantum Dots Enabled by Atomistically Tailored Surface States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP quantum dots demonstrate enhanced luminescence through atomic&#8208;level surface manipulation without shell structures. Concerns persist over core instability due to oxidation propensity and inevitable trap presence. However, utilizing Zn&#8208;oleate removes some traps, and with the addition of GaCl3, most traps are eliminated, achieving over 90% luminescence efficiency with the core alone.








Abstract
Contrary to the prevailing notion that shell structures arise from the intricate chemistry and surface defects of InP quantum dots (QDs), an innovative strategy that remarkably enhances the luminescence efficiency of core&#8208;only InP QDs to over 90% is introduced. This paradigm shift is achieved through the concurrent utilization of group 2 and 3 metal&#8208;derived ligands, providing an effective remedy for surface defects and facilitating charge recombination. Specifically, a combination of Zn carboxylate and Ga chloride is employed to address the undercoordination issues associated with In and P atoms, leading to the alleviation of in&#8208;gap trap states. The intricate interplay and proportional ratio between Ga&#8208; and Zn&#8208;containing ligands play pivotal roles in attaining record&#8208;high luminescence efficiency in core&#8208;only InP QDs, as successfully demonstrated across various sizes and color emissions. Moreover, the fabrication of electroluminescent devices relying solely on InP core emission opens a new direction in optoelectronics, demonstrating the potential of the approach not only in optoelectronic applications but also in catalysis or energy conversion by charge transfer.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is reported for band engineering of PQD solids, which can form a gradient band structure within the PQD solids with substantially diminishes trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination, significantly promoting the charge transport within the PQD solids. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQD solar cells give a remarkable efficiency of up to 16.44%.








Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments can firmly anchor to the PQD surface through the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertical donor&#8211;acceptor phase separation in photomultiplication organic photodetectors induces a partial p&#8208;n heterojunction character with remarkably improved dynamic properties while maintaining high external quantum efficiency and detectivity. The strategy marks a pioneering achievement by showcasing the simultaneous presence of p&#8208;n heterojunction and photomultiplication modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time.








Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, a new PM&#8208;type OPD is developed that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer and n&#8208;type acceptor, referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM&#8208;type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

Notably, VPS PM-type OPDs show three orders of magnitude&#160;increase in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut-off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200-fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM-type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones at &#8722;10&#160;V. The VPS PM-type OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of &lt;i&gt;p-n&lt;/i&gt; HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Designed Spin&#8208;Texture&#8208;Lattice to Control Anisotropic Magnon Transport in Antiferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through control of thin&#8208;film boundary conditions, the magnetic texture present in antiferromagnetic BiFeO3 can be stabilized as a quasi&#8208;1D periodic lattice. This has important implications on spin&#8208;wave transport in the system, which is observed in this work through nitrogen&#8208;vacancy magnetometry imaging, nonlocal transport measurements, and a combination of finite&#8208;element and analytical calculations of the magnon dispersion.








Abstract
Spin waves in magnetic materials are promising information carriers for future computing technologies due to their ultra&#8208;low energy dissipation and long coherence length. Antiferromagnets are strong candidate materials due, in part, to their stability to external fields and larger group velocities. Multiferroic antiferromagnets, such as BiFeO3 (BFO), have an additional degree of freedom stemming from magnetoelectric coupling, allowing for control of the magnetic structure, and thus spin waves, with the electric field. Unfortunately, spin&#8208;wave propagation in BFO is not well understood due to the complexity of the magnetic structure. In this work, long&#8208;range spin transport is explored within an epitaxially engineered, electrically tunable, 1D magnonic crystal. A striking anisotropy is discovered in the spin transport parallel and perpendicular to the 1D crystal axis. Multiscale theory and simulation suggest that this preferential magnon conduction emerges from a combination of a population imbalance in its dispersion, as well as anisotropic structural scattering. This work provides a pathway to electrically reconfigurable magnonic crystals in&#160;antiferromagnets.

         <title>Constructing Slip Stacking Diversity in Van der Waals Homobilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings with angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies are constructed in low&#8208;symmetry van der Waals homobilayers via direct growth. Modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment are developed. The work unveils a unique epitaxy and offers a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.








Abstract
The van der Waals (vdW) interface provides two important degrees of freedom&#8212;twist and slip&#8212;to tune interlayer structures and inspire unique physics. However, constructing diversified high&#8208;quality slip stackings (i.e., lattice orientations between layers are parallel with only interlayer sliding) is more challenging than twisted stackings due to angstrom&#8208;scale structural discrepancies between different slip stackings, sparsity of thermodynamically stable candidates and insufficient mechanism understanding. Here, using transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers as a model system, this work theoretically elucidates that vdW materials with low lattice symmetry and weak interlayer coupling allow the creation of multifarious thermodynamically advantageous slip stackings, and experimentally achieves&#160;13 and 9 slip stackings in 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReS2 and 1T&#8243;&#8208;ReSe2 bilayers via direct growth, which are systematically revealed by atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), angle&#8208;resolved polarization Raman spectroscopy, and second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements. This work also develops modulation strategies to switch the stacking via grain boundaries (GBs) and to expand the slip stacking library from thermodynamic to kinetically favored structures via in situ thermal treatment. Finally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest a prominent dependence of the pressure&#8208;induced electronic band structure transition on stacking configurations. These studies unveil a unique vdW epitaxy and offer a viable means for manipulating interlayer atomic registries.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is reported to improve the level of vehicle&#8208;road collaborative perception and autonomous driving cars. With the assistance of artificial intelligence models, SVRIE enhances the ability to recognize vehicle motion, road surface, and tire health condition, with a perception accuracy of more than 90%.








Abstract
Collaborative perception between a vehicle and the road has the potential to enhance the limited perception capability of autonomous driving technologies. With this background, self&#8208;powered vehicle&#8208;road integrated electronics (SVRIE) with a multilevel fractal structure is designed to play a dual role, including a SVRIE device integrated into vehicle tires and a SVRIE array embedded into a road surface. The pressure sensing capability and anti&#8208;crosstalk performance of the SVRIE array are characterized separately to validate the feasibility of applying the SVRIE in a cooperative vehicle&#8208;infrastructure system. It is demonstrated that the SVRIE based on the multi&#8208;layered fractal structure exhibits maximum performance in collaborative sensing and interaction between vehicles and road information, such as vehicle motion, road surface condition, and tire life cycle health monitoring. Traditional data analysis methods are often of questionable accuracy. Therefore, a convolutional neural network is used to classify the vehicle and road conditions with accuracy of at least 88.3%. The transfer learning model is constructed to enhance the road surface identification capabilities with 100% accuracy. The accuracies of the vehicle tire motion recognition and tire health monitoring are 97% and 99%, respectively. This work provides new ideas for collaborative perception between vehicles and roadsides.

         <title>Minimizing Interfacial Energy Loss and Volatilization of Formamidinium via Polymer&#8208;Assisted D&#8211;A supramolecular Self&#8208;Assembly Interface for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 25.78% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;assisted 5FTPP/PCBM supramolecular donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) interface self&#8208;assembly strategy can minimize interfacial energy losses by addressing thermalization, conduction band offset, and nonradiative recombination, while inhibiting the adverse effect of FA+ volatilization under thermal stress by multidentate anchoring.








Abstract
2D perovskite passivation strategies effectively reduce defect&#8208;assisted carrier nonradiative recombination losses on the perovskite surface. Nonetheless, severe energy losses are causing by carrier thermalization, interfacial nonradiative recombination, and conduction band offset still persist at heterojunction perovskite/PCBM interfaces, which limits further performance enhancement of inverted heterojunction PSCs. Here, 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (5FTPP) is introduced between 3D/2D perovskite heterojunction and PCBM. Compared to tetraphenylporphyrin without electron&#8208;withdrawing fluoro&#8208;substituents, 5FTPP can self&#8208;assemble with PCBM at interface into donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) complex with stronger supramolecular interaction and lower energy transfer losses. This rapid energy transfer from donor (5FTPP) to acceptor (PCBM) within femtosecond scale is demonstrated to enlarge hot carrier extraction rates and ranges, reducing thermalization losses. Furthermore, the incorporation of polystyrene derivative (PD) reinforces D&#8211;A interaction by inhibiting self&#8208;&#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of 5FTPP, while fine&#8208;tuning conduction band offset and suppressing interfacial nonradiative recombination via Schottky barrier, dipole, and n&#8208;doping. Notably, the multidentate anchoring of PD&#8208;5FTPP with FA+, Pb2+, and I&#8722; mitigates the adverse effects of FA+ volatilization during thermal stress. Ultimately, devices with PD&#8208;5FTPP achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.78% (certified: 25.36%), maintaining over 90% of initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous illumination at the maximum power point (65&#160;&#176;C) under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Aided Design of Highly Conductive Anion Exchange Membranes for Fuel Cells and Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive anion exchange membrane (AEM) structures are identified from a pool of 180000 AEM variations through a trained fully connected neural network (FCNN) model. Under the guidance of machine learning, synthesized AEMs with anilinium cation domain facilitate the formation of continuous ion channels, showing potential applications in AEM&#8208;based energy devices.








Abstract
Alkaline anion exchange membrane (AEM)&#8208;based fuel cells (AEMFCs) and water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) are vital for enabling the efficient and large&#8208;scale utilization of hydrogen energy. However, the performance of such energy devices is impeded by the relatively low conductivity of AEMs. The conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach to designing membrane structures has proven to be both inefficient and costly. To address this challenge, a fully connected neural network (FCNN) model is developed based on acid&#8208;catalyzed AEMs to analyze the relationship between structure and conductivity among 180,000 AEM variations. Under machine learning guidance, anilinium cation&#8208;type membranes are designed and synthesized. Molecular dynamics simulations and Mulliken charge population analysis validated that the presence of a large anilinium cation domain is a result of the inductive effect of N+ and benzene rings. The interconnected anilinium cation domains facilitated the formation of a continuous ion transport channel within the AEMs. Additionally, the incorporation of the benzyl electron&#8208;withdrawing group heightened the inductive effect, leading to high conductivity AEM variant as screened by the machine learning model. Furthermore, based on the highly active and low&#8208;cost monomers given by machine learning, the large&#8208;scale synthesis of anilinium&#8208;based AEMs confirms the potential for commercial applications.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an attempt is made to unveil the in situ evolution of Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs by using carbon nanofibers modified with CoOx as Li anode host, and 18O isotope tracing provides firm evidence of oxygen migration from CoOx to Li2O besides electrolyte decomposition. The as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly help improve the anode performance in half, symmetrical, and full cells.








Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which can show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and nonuniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) are successfully prepared as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, the role of CoOx during SEI evolution is elucidated, revealing that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore, the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode can exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Functional Lanthanide Metallopolymer: Self&#8208;Healing and Photo&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dual&#8208;Emitting Luminescence for Diverse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Visible/UV&#8208;light&#8208;driven photosensitive photoluminescent metallopolymers with good mechanical properties and fast self&#8208;healing behaviors are successfully developed by incorporating spiropyran and terpyridine components into a unified lanthanide polymer structure. By adjusting the proportions of raw material, precise control over the stimulus response and luminescent color can be achieved. The obtained polymers have been applied for dynamic information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing, and Light&#8208;writing fields.








Abstract
Photoluminescent metallopolymers displaying photo&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive properties are emerging as promising materials with versatile applications in photo&#8208;rewritable patterns, wearable UV sensors, and optical encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting. However, integrating these materials into practical applications that require fast response times, lightweight qualities, fatigue resistance, and multiple encryption capabilities poses challenges. In this study, luminescent photochromic lanthanide (Ln) metallopolymers with rapid self&#8208;healing properties are developed by cross&#8208;linking terpyridine (Tpy)&#8208; and spiropyran (SP)&#8208; functionalized polyurethane chains through Ln&#8208;Tpy coordination bonds and H&#8208;bonds among polymer chains. The resulting products exhibit a range of intriguing features: i) photo&#8208;stimuli responsiveness using spiropyran monomers without additional dopants; ii) dual&#8208;emitting performance under UV&#8208;light due to Ln&#8208;Tpy and open&#8208;ring spiropyran moieties; iii) satisfactory mechanical properties and self&#8208;healing abilities from polymer chains; iv) multiple control switches for luminescence colors through photostimulation or feed ratio adjustments. Leveraging these attributes, the developed material introduces novel opportunities for light&#8208;writing applications, advanced information encryption, UV&#8208;sensing wearable devices, and insights into designing multifunctional intelligent materials for the future.

         <title>Injectable and Sprayable Fluorescent Nanoprobe for Rapid Real&#8208;Time Detection of Human Colorectal Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational design of nanoprobes for colorectal cancer imaging agents is carried out by developing Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT with a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (up to 12.3) and fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying), thus enabling successful recognition of the tumor boundary. This work has demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach as a promising strategy in image&#8208;guided tumor resection.









Abstract
The development of minimally invasive surgery has greatly advanced precision tumor surgery, but sometime suffers from restricted visualization of the surgical field, especially during the removal of abdominal tumors. A 3&#8208;D inspection of tumors could be achieved by intravenously injecting tumor&#8208;selective fluorescent probes, whereas most of which are unable to instantly distinguish tumors via in situ spraying, which is urgently needed in the process of surgery in a convenient manner. In this study, this work has designed an injectable and sprayable fluorescent nanoprobe, termed Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, to realize rapid tumor imaging in freshly dissected human colorectal tumors and animal models. Mechanistically, the incorporation of &#947;&#8208;glutamyl group facilitates the rapid internalization of Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT, and these internalized nanoprobes can be subsequently activated by intracellular NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase&#8208;1 to release near&#8208;infrared fluorophores. As a result, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT can achieve a superior tumor&#8208;to&#8208;normal ratio (TNR) up to 12.3 and enable a fast visualization (3&#160;min after in situ spraying) of tumor boundaries in the xenograft tumor models, Apcmin/+ mice models and fresh human tumor tissues. In addition, Poly&#8208;g&#8208;BAT is capable of identifying minimal premalignant lesions via intravenous injection.

A novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded it into an F&#8208;2DP system by simple air&#8211;liquid interface method to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces between the interlayer and regulate the charge transfer along the intralayer to induce multilevel memory behavior for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;containing 2D polymer (F&#8208;2DP) film is a desired system to regulate the charge transport in organic electronics but rather rarely reports due to the limited fluorine&#8208;containing building blocks and difficulties in synthesis. Herein, a novel polar molecule with antiparallel columnar stacking is synthesized and further embedded into an F&#8208;2DP system to control over the crystallinity of F&#8208;2DP film through self&#8208;complementary &#960;&#8208;electronic forces. The donor&#8211;accepter&#8211;accepter&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8242; (D&#8211;A&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8242;) structure regulates the charge transportation efficiently, inducing multilevel memory behavior through stepwise charge capture and transfer processes. Thus, the device exhibits ternary memory behavior with low threshold voltage (Vth1 of 1.1&#160;V, Vth2 of 2.0&#160;V), clearly distinguishable resistance states (1:102:104) and ternary yield (83%). Furthermore, the stepwise formation of the charge complex endows the device with a wider range to regulate the conductive state, which allows its application in brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing. Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology recognition can reach an accuracy of 86%, showing great potential in neuromorphic computing applications in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <title>Positively Charged Hollow Co Nanoshells by Kirkendall Effect Stabilized by Electron Sink for Alkaline Water Dissociation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow cobalt&#160;(Co) nanoshells are formed via the Kirkendall effect and stabilized by conductive MoO2 pillars and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. The Co particles are positively charged on the surface which accelerates&#160;the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process.








Abstract
While cobalt (Co) exhibits a comparable energy barrier for H* adsorption/desorption to platinum in theory, it is generally not suitable for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) because of unfavorable water dissociation. Here, the Kirkendall effect is adopted to fabricate positive&#8208;charged hollow metal Co (PHCo) nanoshells that are stabilized by MoO2 and chainmail carbon as the electron sink. Compared to the zero&#8208;valent Co, the PHCo accelerates the water dissociation and changes the rate&#8208;determining step from Volmer to Heyrovsky process. Alkaline HER occurs with a low overpotential of 59.0&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Operando Raman and first principles calculations reveal that the interfacial water to the PHCo sites and the accelerated proton transfer are conducive to the adsorption and dissociation of H2O molecules. Meanwhile, the upshifted d&#8208;band center of PHCo optimizes the adsorption/desorption of H*. This work provides a unique synthesis of hollow Co nanoshells via the Kirkendall effect and insights to water dissociation on catalyst surfaces with tailored charge states.

         <title>Unveiling Gating Behavior in Piezoionic Effect: toward Neuromimetic Tactile Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoionic hydrogels hold the potential to enable direct ionic gating of transistors. This research reveals that these hydrogels can exhibit gating behavior in response to mechanical stimuli, an analog to the mechanically gated phenomena observed in biological neurons. This breakthrough not only advances neuromimetic pressure sensors but also enhances fundamental understanding of the piezoionic mechanism.








Abstract
The human perception system's information processing is intricately linked to the nonlinear response and gating effect of neurons. While piezoionics holds potential in emulating the pressure sensing capability of biological skin, the incorporation of information processing functions seems neglected. Here, ionic gating behavior in piezoionic hydrogels is uncovered as a notable extension beyond the previously observed linear responses. The hydrogel can generate remarkably high voltages (700&#160;mV) and currents (7&#160;mA) when indentation forces surpass the threshold. Through a comprehensive analysis involving simulations and experimental investigations, it is proposed that the gating behavior emerges due to significant diffusion differences between cations and anions. To showcase the practical implications of this breakthrough, the piezoionic hydrogels are successfully integrated with prostheses and robot hands, demonstrating that the gating effect enables accurate discrimination between gentle and harsh touch. The advancement in neuromimetic tactile sensing has significant potential for emerging applications such as humanoid robotics and biomedical engineering, offering valuable opportunities for further development of embodied neuromorphic intelligence.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lightly cross&#8208;linked alkyl acrylates can function as thermochromic materials with ultrahigh transparency and solar&#8208;modulating abilities via a crystalline&#8208;to&#8208;amorphous polymer transition. When used as greenhouse materials or coupled with thermoelectric devices, the thermochromic layer is able to function as a thermal valve.








Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change color in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy&#8208;efficient windows being one of the primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) are observed. The transition temperature is tunable from 11 to 61&#160;&#176;C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement is observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>A Universal Biocompatible and Multifunctional Solid Electrolyte in p&#8208;Type and n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Complementary Circuits and Bioelectronic Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and biocompatible, highly stretchable, flexible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte for bioelectronic applications is introduced. This nonvolatile electrolyte demonstrates compatibility with a wide range of both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels for organic electrochemical transistors while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. They are further used in circuits and for sensing physiological signals.








Abstract
The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self&#8208;healable gelatin&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolyte, compatible with both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT&#8208;based complementary inverter with a record&#8208;high normalized&#8208;gain of 228 V&#8722;1 and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power&#8208;efficient implants.

&lt;p&gt;A novel and biocompatible, highly stretchable, flexible, self-healable gelatin-based solid-state electrolyte for bioelectronic applications is introduced. This nonvolatile electrolyte demonstrates compatibility with a wide range of both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type channels for organic electrochemical transistors while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. They are further used in circuits and for sensing physiological signals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of soft and flexible devices for collection of bioelectrical signals is gaining momentum for wearable and implantable applications. Among these devices, organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) stand out due to their low operating voltage and large signal amplification capable of transducing weak biological signals. While liquid electrolytes have demonstrated efficacy in OECTs, they limit its operating temperature and pose challenges for electronic packaging due to potential leakage. Conversely, solid electrolytes offer advantages such as mechanical flexibility, robustness against environmental factors, and ability to bridge the interface between rigid dry electronics systems and soft wet biological tissues. However, few systems have demonstrated generality and compatibility with a wide range of state-of-the-art organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs). This paper introduces a highly stretchable, flexible, biocompatible, self-healable gelatin-based solid-state electrolyte, compatible with both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type OMIEC channels while maintaining high performance and excellent stability. Furthermore, this nonvolatile electrolyte is stable up to 120&#160;&#176;C and exhibits high ionic conductivity even in dry environment. Additionally, an OECT-based complementary inverter with a record-high normalized-gain of 228 V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a corresponding ultralow static power consumption of 1 nW is demonstrated. These advancements pave the way for versatile applications ranging from bioelectronics to power-efficient implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Extracting Geometry and Topology of Orange Pericarps for the Design of Bioinspired Energy Absorbing Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired material design method is presented to imitate the irregular structure of biological materials and obtain their outstanding mechanical properties. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, the method identifies distributions of fundamental building blocks and connectivity rules and generates synthetic equivalents with the same distributions. The method is demonstrated using the orange pericarp, known for protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities.








Abstract
As a result of evolution, many biological materials have developed irregular structures that lead to outstanding mechanical performances, like high stiffness&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and good energy absorption. However, reproducing these irregular biological structures in synthetic materials remains a complex design and fabrication challenge. Here, a bioinspired material design method is presented that characterizes the irregular structure as a network of building blocks, also known as tiles, and rules to connect them. Rather than replicating the biological structure one&#8208;to&#8208;one, synthetic materials are generated with the same distributions of tiles and connectivity rules as the biological material and it is shown that these equivalent materials have structure&#8208;to&#8208;property relationships similar to the biological ones. To demonstrate the method, the pericarp of the orange, a member of the citrus family known for its protective, energy&#8208;absorbing capabilities is studied. Polymer samples are generated and characterized under quasistatic and dynamic compression and display spatially&#8208;varying stiffness and good energy absorption, as seen in the biological materials. By quantifying which tiles and connectivity rules locally deform in response to loading, it is also determined how to spatially control the stiffness and energy absorption.

         <title>Plasmonic Nanostructures Grown from Reacting Droplet&#8208;In&#8208;Microwell Array on Flexible Films for Quantitative Surface&#8208;Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy in Plant Wearable In Situ Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A micro&#8208;well structured plasmonic film with in situ grown dendritic Ag nanostructures is developed for plant wearable surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) detection. The film capitalizes on the concentration enrichment of analytes through droplet evaporation within the microwell, facilitating ultrasensitive detection. Additionally, this film offers dual&#8208;sided detection and allows for multiplexed identification of target analytes, expanding its utility in precision agriculture, bio&#8208;sensing, and environmental surveillance.








Abstract
Plant wearable detection has garnered significant interest in advancing agricultural intelligence and promoting sustainable food production amidst the challenges of climate change. Accurately monitoring plant health and agrochemical residue levels necessitates qualities such as precision, affordability, simplicity, and noninvasiveness. Here, a novel attachable plasmonic film is introduced and designed for on&#8208;site detection of agrochemical residues utilizing surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). By functionalizing a thin polydimethylsiloxane film with silver nanoparticles via controlled droplet reactions in micro&#8208;well arrays, a plasmonic film is achieved that not only maintains optical transparency for precise analyte localization but also conforms closely to the plant surface, facilitating highly sensitive SERS measurements. The reliability of this film enables accurate identification and quantification of individual compounds and their mixtures, boasting an ultra&#8208;low detection limit ranging from 10&#8722;16 to 10&#8722;13 m, with mini mal relative standard deviation. To showcase its potential, on&#8208;field detection of pesticide residues on fruit surfaces is conducted using a handheld Raman spectrometer. This advancement in fabricating plasmonic nanostructures on flexible films holds promise for expanding SERS applications beyond plant monitoring, including personalized health monitoring, point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis, wearable devices for human&#8211;machine interface, and on&#8208;site monitoring of environmental&#160;pollutants.

         <title>Manipulating Alkyl Inner Side Chain of Acceptor for Efficient As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulating the alkyl inner side chain of the small molecule acceptors assists in regulating molecular bandgap, energy levels, and intermolecular interaction, which is conducive to optimizing the trade&#8208;off among short&#8208;circuit current density, open&#8208;circuit voltage, and fill factor. Consequently, the optimal as&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) deliver top&#8208;ranked efficiencies of over 18%.








Abstract
As&#8208;cast organic solar cells (OSCs) possess tremendous potential for low&#8208;cost commercial applications. Herein, five small&#8208;molecule acceptors (A1&#8211;A5) are designed and synthesized by selectively and elaborately extending the alkyl inner side chain flanking on the pyrrole motif to prepare efficient as&#8208;cast devices. As the extension of the alkyl chain, the absorption spectra of the films are gradually blue&#8208;shifted from A1 to A5 along with slightly uplifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, which is conducive for optimizing the trade&#8208;off between short&#8208;circuit current density and open&#8208;circuit voltage of the devices. Moreover, a longer alkyl chain improves compatibility between the acceptor and donor. The in situ technique clarifies that good compatibility will prolong molecular assembly time and assist in the preferential formation of the donor phase, where the acceptor precipitates in the framework formed by the donor. The corresponding film&#8208;formation dynamics facilitate the realization of favorable film morphology with a suitable fibrillar structure, molecular stacking, and vertical phase separation, resulting in an incremental fill factor from A1 to A5&#8208;based devices. Consequently, the A3&#8208;based as&#8208;cast OSCs achieve a top&#8208;ranked efficiency of 18.29%. This work proposes an ingenious strategy to manipulate intermolecular interactions and control the film&#8208;formation process for constructing high&#8208;performance as&#8208;cast devices.

         <title>Reactive Processing of Furan&#8208;Based Monomers via Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization for High Performance Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
New monomers capable of frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization are identified through computational screening of thermostability and ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization exotherms. Subsequent experimental validation of physical properties of monomers, kinetics, and material properties reveal frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization viability and promise in enabling energy&#8208;efficient manufacturing of 3D printed structures and gradient materials.








Abstract
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) presents an energy&#8208;efficient approach to produce high&#8208;performance polymers, typically utilizing norbornene derivatives from Diels&#8211;Alder reactions. This study broadens the monomer repertoire for FROMP, incorporating the cycloaddition product of biosourced furan compounds and benzyne, namely 1,4&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1,4&#8208;epoxynaphthalene (HEN) derivatives. A computational screening of Diels&#8211;Alder products is conducted, selecting products with resistance to retro&#8208;Diels&#8211;Alder but also sufficient ring strain to facilitate FROMP. The experiments reveal that varying substituents both modulate the FROMP kinetics and enable the creation of thermoplastic materials characterized by different thermomechanical properties. Moreover, HEN&#8208;based crosslinkers are designed to enhance the resulting thermomechanical properties at high temperatures (&gt;200&#160;&#176;C). The versatility of such materials is demonstrated through direct ink writing (DIW) to rapidly produce 3D structures without the need for printed supports. This research significantly extends the range of monomers suitable for FROMP, furthering efficient production of high&#8208;performance polymeric materials.

         <title>Complementary Multisite Turnover Catalysis toward Superefficient Bifunctional Seawater Splitting at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional non&#8208;noble electrocatalyst is in situ constructed on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative interfaces and abundant multifunctional trimetal sites for seawater electrolysis, in which interfacial Mo sites are responsible for hydrogen evolution, while Co/Fe species facilitate oxygen evolution kinetics, thus cooperatively expediting bifunctional freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69 V, outperforming most of the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The utilization of seawater for hydrogen production via water splitting is increasingly recognized as a promising avenue for the future. The key dilemma for seawater electrolysis is the incompatibility of superior hydrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;evolving activities at ampere&#8208;scale current densities for both cathodic and anodic catalysts, thus leading to large electric power consumption of overall seawater splitting. Here, in situ construction of Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 heterostructure arrays anchoring on metallic nickel nitride surface with multilevel collaborative catalytic interfaces and abundant multifunctional metal sites is reported, which serves as a robust bifunctional catalyst for alkaline freshwater/seawater splitting at ampere&#8208;level current density. Operando Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopic studies combined with density functional theory calculations corroborate that Mo and Co/Fe sites situated on the Fe4N/Co3N/MoO2 multilevel interfaces optimize the reaction pathway and coordination environment to enhance water adsorption/dissociation, hydrogen adsorption, and oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate adsorption, thus cooperatively expediting hydrogen/oxygen evolution reactions in base. Inspiringly, this electrocatalyst can substantially ameliorate overall freshwater/seawater splitting at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with low cell voltages of 1.65/1.69&#160;V, along with superb long&#8208;term stability at 500&#8211;1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for over 200 h, outperforming nearly all the ever&#8208;reported non&#8208;noble electrocatalysts for freshwater/seawater electrolysis. This work offers a viable approach to design high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for seawater splitting.

         <dc:description>
To advance high&#8208;quality imaging units in optoelectronic systems, a phototransistor that shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics is reported. Thanks to the programmable two&#8208;dimensional electron gas which can be modulated by drain/gate voltage inputs under different light exposure, a triplex photo&#8208;imaging functionality with capable of self&#8208;powering, photoconduction, and photo&#8208;synaptic operation is achieved, providing guidance toward system&#8208;on&#8208;chip photoelectric systems.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in the digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single&#8208;device platform are in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. Herein, an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure is reported, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electron gas (2DEGs). Owing to the programmable feature of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs, with a particular capability of electron separation, collection and storage under different light illumination, the phototransistor shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8776;108&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 are achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage ability. The demonstration of three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Colossal Near&#8208;Field Radiative Heat Transfer Mediated by Coupled Polaritons with an Ultrahigh Dynamic Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;area device near&#8208;field thermal radiation measurement system with in situ adjustable vacuum gap distances down to &lt;100&#160;nm is successfully established. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient of near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can reach unprecedented values with the help of coupled polaritons. The dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the strong coupling effect.








Abstract
Near&#8208;field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed the blackbody limit by several orders of magnitude owing to the tunneling evanescent waves. Exploiting this near&#8208;field enhancement holds significant potential for emerging technologies. It has been suggested that coupled polaritons can give rise to orders of magnitude enhancement of NFRHT. However, a thorough experimental verification of this phenomenon is still missing. Here this work experimentally shows that NFRHT mediated by coupled polaritons in millimeter&#8208;size graphene/SiC/SiO2 composite devices in planar plate configuration can realize about 302.8 &#177; &#8197;35.2&#8208;fold enhancement with respect to the blackbody limit at a gap distance of 87&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.8&#160;nm. The radiative thermal conductance and effective gap heat transfer coefficient can reach unprecedented values of 0.136 WK&#8722;1 and 5440 Wm&#8722;2K&#8722;1. Additionally, a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical measurement, in conjunction with full&#8208;wave numerical simulations, provides further evidence for the coupled polaritonic characteristics of the devices. Notably, this work experimentally demonstrates dynamic regulation of NFRHT can be achieved by modulating the bias voltage, leading to an ultrahigh dynamic range of &#8776;4.115. This work ambiguously elucidates the important role of coupled polaritons in NFRHT, paving the way for the manipulation of nanoscale heat transport, energy conversion, and thermal computing via the strong coupling effect.

         <title>High&#8208;Lactate&#8208;Metabolizing Photosynthetic Bacteria Reprogram Tumor Immune Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lactate has emerged as a critical immunosuppressive factor within the tumor microenvironment, greatly impeding the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Hence, depriving lactate provides a favorable strategy to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM). This research suggests that LAB&#8208;1 is capable of colonizing TIM and sustaining a long&#8208;term reduction in lactate concentration. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that lactate metabolism efficiently reprograms TIM.








Abstract
The elevated levels of lactate in tumor tissue play a pivotal role in fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Therefore, efficiently reducing lactate levels to reprogram tumor immune microenvironment (TIM) is considered a crucial step for boosted immunotherapy. Here, a high&#8208;lactate&#8208;metabolizing photosynthetic bacteria (LAB&#8208;1) is selectively screened for TIM reprogramming, which then improves the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. The culture medium for LAB&#8208;1 screening is initially developed through an orthogonal experiment, simulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and utilizing lactate as the sole organic carbon source. As demonstrated in a murine 4T1 model, LAB&#8208;1 colonizes the TME selectively, resulting in a significant reduction in lactate levels and a subsequent increase in pH values within the tumor tissue. Furthermore, single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing analysis reveals that LAB&#8208;1 effectively reprograms the TIM, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of antitumor immune therapy. This approach of utilizing lactate&#8208;consuming bacteria represents a potent tool for augmenting tumor immunotherapy efficiency.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Engineered Macrophage&#8208;Microbe Encapsulation for Metastasis Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) is developed for safe lung metastatic delivery of antitumor bacteria. After administration, strain&#8208;loaded engineered macrophages can be actively enriched toward tumors. This strategy enhances the biocompatibility of microbial therapies while achieving efficient enrichment of the strains in the tumor. The proliferated intratumoral engineered strains activate the tumor microenvironment, achieving potent anticancer effects.








Abstract
Lung metastases are the leading cause of death among cancer patients. The challenges of inefficient drug delivery, compounded by a robust immunosuppressive microenvironment, make effective treatment difficult. Here, an innovative dual&#8208;engineered macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (Du&#8208;EMME) therapy is developed that integrates modified macrophages and engineered antitumor bacteria. These engineered macrophages, termed R&#8208;GEM cells, are designed to express RGD peptides on extracellular membranes, enhancing their tumor cell binding and intratumor enrichment. R&#8208;GEM cells are cocultured with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009, producing macrophage&#8208;microbe encapsulation (R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells). The intracellular bacteria maintain bioactivity for more than 24&#160;h, and the bacteria released from R&#8208;GEM/VNP cells within the tumor continue to exert bacteria&#8208;mediated antitumor effects. This is further supported by macrophage&#8208;based chemotaxis and camouflage, which enhance the intratumoral enrichment and biocompatibility of the bacteria. Additionally, R&#8208;GEM cells loaded with IFN&#947;&#8208;secreting strains (VNP&#8208;IFN&#947;) form R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells. Treatment with these cells effectively halts lung metastatic tumor progression in three mouse models (breast cancer, melanoma, and colorectal cancer). R&#8208;GEM/VNP&#8208;IFN&#947; cells vigorously activate the tumor microenvironment, suppressing tumor&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;type macrophages, MDSCs, and Tregs, and enhancing tumor&#8208;antagonizing M1&#8208;type macrophages, mature DCs, and Teffs. Du&#8208;EMME therapy offers a promising strategy for targeted and enhanced antitumor immunity in treating cancer metastases.

         <title>Reaction&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly of Polymyxin Mitigates Cytotoxicity and Reverses Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first example of reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) is presented in the aqueous solution of antibiotics and adjuvants via dynamic covalent bonding. The resulting assemblies via RISA effectively mask the positive charge of polymyxins, preventing their interaction with negatively charged mammalian cells and reducing potential cytotoxicity, enhancing the bactericidal efficacy of polymyxins and preventing the emergence of further resistance.








Abstract
Polymyxins have been regarded as an efficient therapeutic against many life&#8208;threatening, multidrug resistant Gram&#8208;negative bacterial infections; however, the cytotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance associated with polymyxins have greatly hindered their clinical potential. Herein, the reaction&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (RISA) of polymyxins and natural aldehydes in aqueous solution is presented. The resulting assemblies effectively mask the positively charged nature of polymyxins, reducing their cytotoxicity. Moreover, the representative PMBA4 (composed of polymyxin B (PMB) and (E)&#8208;2&#8208;heptenal (A4)) assemblies demonstrate enhanced binding to Gram&#8208;negative bacterial outer membranes and exhibit multiple antimicrobial mechanisms, including increased membrane permeability, elevated bacterial metabolism, suppression of quorum sensing, reduced ATP synthesis, and potential reduction of bacterial drug resistance. Remarkably, PMBA4 assemblies reverse drug resistance in clinically isolated drug&#8208;resistant strains of Gram&#8208;negative bacteria, demonstrating exceptional efficacy in preventing and eradicating bacterial biofilms. PMBA4 assemblies efficiently eradicate Gram&#8208;negative bacterial biofilm infections in vivo and alleviate inflammatory response. This RISA strategy offers a practical and clinically applicable approach to minimize side effects, reverse drug resistance, and prevent the emergence of resistance associated with free polymyxins.

         <title>Suppressed Defects by Functional Thermally Cross&#8208;Linked Fullerene for High&#8208;Efficiency Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed tin&#8208;lead&#8208;based perovskite solar cells with ideal bandgap (1.2 eV) develop rapidly, while the top interface defects and Sn oxidation cannot be solved simultaneously. It is found cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) can coordinate with perovskite and optimize the interface and bulk of perovskite. This work demonstrates the optimization effect of C&#8208;PCBSD on perovskite interface and bulk.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites have attracted the attention of the community due to their narrow bandgap, ideal for photovoltaic applications, especially tandem solar cells. However, the oxidation and rapid crystallization of Sn2+ and the interfacial traps hinder their development. Here, cross&#8208;linkable [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric styryl dendron ester (C&#8208;PCBSD) is introduced during the quenching step of perovskite thin film processing to suppress the generation of surface defects at the electron transport layer interface and improve the bulk crystallinity. The C&#8208;PCBSD has strong coordination ability with Sn2+ and Pb2+ perovskite precursors, which retards the crystallization process, suppresses the oxidation of Sn2+, and improves the perovskite bulk and surface crystallinity, yielding films with reduced nonradiative recombination and enhanced interface charge extraction. Besides, the C&#8208;PCBSD network deposited on the perovskite surface displays superior hydrophobicity and oxygen resistance. Consequently, the devices with C&#8208;PCBSD obtain PCEs of up to 23.4% and retained 97% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of storage in a N2 atmosphere.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnet&#8208;Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n&#8208;GaAs via the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n&#8208;GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 








Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix l&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free SC spintronics.

         <title>Bipolar Textile Composite Electrodes Enabling Flexible Tandem Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) is fabricated by sandwiching the nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) with the cathode and Li metal anode layers. The energy density of BTCE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries increases significantly. More impressively, benefiting from the outstanding flexibility of BTCE, the pouch cell shows zero capacity decay under thousands of bending and folding tests.








Abstract
A majority of flexible and wearable electronics require high operational voltage that is conventionally achieved by serial connection of battery unit cells using external wires. However, this inevitably decreases the energy density of the battery module and may cause additional safety hazards. Herein, a bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) that enables internal tandem&#8208;stacking configuration to yield high&#8208;voltage (6 to 12&#160;V class) solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) is reported. BTCE is comprised of a nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) core layer, a cathode coated on one side of the NiPET, and a Li metal anode coated on the other side of the NiPET. Stacking BTCEs with solid&#8208;state electrolytes alternatively leads to the extension of output voltage and decreased usage of inert package materials, which in turn significantly boosts the energy density of the battery. More importantly, the BTCE&#8208;based SSLMB possesses remarkable capacity retention per cycle of over 99.98% over cycling. The composite structure of BTCE also enables outstanding flexibility; the battery keeps stable charge/discharge characteristics over thousands of bending and folding. BTCE shows great promise for future safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and flexible SSLMBs for a wide range of flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Retinomorphic Color Perception Based on Opponent Process Enabled by Perovskite Bipolar Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual perovskite absorber device in an antagonistic configuration is capable of generate bipolar responses with colors from the opponent pairs. Two variants (red&#8208;green and yellow&#8208;blue opponents) are fabricated, and filter&#8208;free machine color vision with high contrasts is demonstrated. The adaptation capabilities of the perovskite photodetector also ensure accurate color perception in different lighting conditions.








Abstract
The ability to perceive color by the retina can be attributed to both its trichromatic photoreceptors and the antagonistic neural wiring known as the opponent process. While neuromorphic sensors have been shown to demonstrate memory and adaptation capabilities, color perception is still challenging due to the intrinsic lack of spectral selectivity in narrow bandgap semiconductors. Furthermore, research on emulating neural wiring is severely lacking. The combination of halide perovskite materials with a tunable bandgap and a novel bipolar photodetector design emulates the efficiency of the retina in processing color information. The stimuli&#8208;responsive material is also responsible for maintaining partial color constancy&#8212;an adaptation feature. Leveraging the unique enhancement of color contrasts, an in&#8208;sensor data compression and edge detection can also be demonstrated. The color perception, chromatic adaptation, and color contrast enhancement make perovskite bipolar photodetectors a unique example where the sensor and neural wiring can be co&#8208;developed in conjunction.

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels Crafted via Lignin&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular hydrogel forms by diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, creating high&#8208;density crystalline domains and networks. This enhances mechanical properties (tensile strength: &#8776;20 Mpa, Young's modulus: &#8776;14 Mpa, toughness: &#8776;50 MJ&#160;m&#8315;3) and provides low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking (&#8776;100%). 









Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are typically assembled through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, posing a significant challenge in achieving ultra strength. Developing a higher strength based on molecular/nanoscale engineering concepts is a potential improvement strategy. Herein, a super&#8208;tough supramolecular hydrogel is assembled by gradually diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. Both simulations and analytical results indicate that the assembly and subsequent enhancement of the crosslinked network are primarily attributed to LS&#8208;induced formation and gradual densification of strong crystalline domains within the hydrogel. The optimized hydrogel exhibits impressive mechanical properties with tensile strength of &#8776;20&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of &#8776;14&#160;MPa, and toughness of &#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8315;3, making it the strongest lignin&#8208;PVA/polymer hydrogel known so far. Moreover, LS provides the supramolecular hydrogel with excellent low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking capability (&#8776;100%). Interestingly, the diffusion ability of LS is demonstrated for self&#8208;restructuring damaged supramolecular hydrogel, achieving 3D patterning on hydrogel surfaces, and enhancing the local strength of the freeze&#8208;thaw PVA hydrogel. The goal is to foster a versatile hydrogel platform by combining eco&#8208;friendly LS with biocompatible PVA, paving the way for innovation and interdisciplinarity in biomedicine, engineering materials, and forestry science.

         <title>Biometabolically Derived Selenium Nanoparticles Armed with Protein Protective Suit toward High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#8220;Functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; bio&#8208;selenium nanoparticles are developed by Bacillus subtilis subsp.&#8217;s microbial metabolism process from toxic selenite (SeO32&#8722;), in which selenium nanoparticles are tightly encased in a natural biomembrane with rich functional groups containing nitrogen and phosphorus that effectively suppress shuttle effect and alleviate volume expansion, achieving superior electrochemical and structural stability.








Abstract
Selenium (Se) serves as a burgeoning high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of Se cathode is strictly limited by low Se utilization and inferior cycling stability arising from intrinsic volume expansion and notorious shuttle effect. Herein, a microbial metabolism strategy is developed to prepare &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules via Bacillus subtilis subsp. from selenite in sewage, in which Se nanoparticles are armed with a natural biological protein membrane with rich nitrogen and phosphorus, achieving the eco&#8208;efficient conversion of trash into treasure (selenite, SeO32&#8722; &#8594; Selenium, Se). The appealing&#8208;design &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules are beneficial to accommodate volume changes of Se in electrochemical reactions, confining polyselenides via chemisorption, and enhancing mechanical strength of electrode by associated bacteria debris, realizing comprehensive utilization of microorganism. By conceptualizing &#8220;functional vesicle&#8208;like&#8221; Se globules, rather than artificial Se&#8208;host composites, as cathode for lithium&#8211;selenium batteries, it exhibits outstanding cycling stability and improved rate performance. This strategy opens the door to design smart electrode materials with unattainable structure that cannot be achieved by traditional approaches, achieving eco&#8208;efficient conversion of pollutants into energy&#8208;storage nanomaterials, which will be a promising research field for interdisciplinary of energy, biology, and environment.

         <title>Optimizing Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology via Solid Additive Strategy Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with 19.50% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM) is constructed and optimized in the all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the use of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. Through subtly modifying the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene additives, improved molecular packing and well&#8208;defined DFMN are simultaneously realized, leading to a record efficiency of 19.50% for all&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Double&#8208;fibril network morphology (DFNM), in which the donor and the acceptor can self&#8208;assemble into a double&#8208;fibril structure, is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in organic solar cells. Herein, it is demonstrated that such DFNM can be constructed and optimized in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) with the assistance of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. It is revealed that the incorporation of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene can induce a stepwise regulation in the aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules during film casting and thermal annealing processes. Through altering the alkoxy of 2&#8208;alkoxynaphthalene solid additives, both the intermolecular interactions and molecular miscibility with the host materials can be precisely tuned, which allows for the optimization of the molecular aggregation process and facilitation of molecular self&#8208;assembly, and thus leading to reinforced molecular packing and optimized DFNM. As a result, an unprecedented efficiency of 19.50% (certified as 19.1%) is obtained for 2&#8208;ethoxynaphthalene&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT&#8208;X all&#8208;PSCs with excellent photostability (T80&#160;=&#160;1750&#160;h). This work reveals that the optimization of DFNM via solid additive strategy is a promising avenue to boosting the performance of all&#8208;PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Double-fibril network morphology (DFNM) is constructed and optimized in the all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with the use of 2-alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. Through subtly modifying the alkoxy of 2-alkoxynaphthalene additives, improved molecular packing and well-defined DFMN are simultaneously realized, leading to a record efficiency of 19.50% for all-PSCs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-fibril network morphology (DFNM), in which the donor and the acceptor can self-assemble into a double-fibril structure, is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in organic solar cells. Herein, it is demonstrated that such DFNM can be constructed and optimized in all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with the assistance of 2-alkoxynaphthalene volatile solid additives. It is revealed that the incorporation of 2-alkoxynaphthalene can induce a stepwise regulation in the aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules during film casting and thermal annealing processes.

         <title>In&#8208;Sublattice Carrier Transition Enabled Polarimetric Photodetectors with Reconfigurable Polarity Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is proposed. By changing the gate voltage, the device exhibits reconfigurable PR values from positive to negative, covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Moreover, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is implemented. This work makes a conceptual advance in designing next&#8208;generation miniaturized highly polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronics.








Abstract
Miniaturized polarimetric photodetectors based on anisotropic two&#8208;dimensional&#160;materials attract potential applications in ultra&#8208;compact polarimeters. However, these photodetectors are hindered by the small polarization ratio values and complicated artificial structures. Here, a novel polarization photodetector based on in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, with a giant and reconfigurable PR value, is demonstrated. The unique periodic sublattice structure of CdSb2Se3Br2 features an in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition preferred along Sb2Se3 chains. Leveraging on the in&#8208;sublattice carrier transition in the CdSb2Se3Br2/WSe2 heterostructure, gate voltage has an anisotropic modulation effect on the band alignment of heterostructure along sublattice. Consequently, the heterostructure exhibits a polarization&#8208;tunable photo&#8208;induced threshold voltage shift, which provides reconfigurable PR values from positive (unipolar regime) to negative (bipolar regime), covering all possible numbers (1&#8594;+&#8734;/&#8722;&#8734;&#8594;&#8722;1). Using this anisotropic photovoltaic effect, gate&#8208;tunable polarimetric imaging is successfully implemented. This work provides a new platform for developing next&#8208;generation highly polarimetric optoelectronics.

         <title>Liquid Gallium&#8208;Assisted Pyrolysis of MOF Affording CNT Non&#8208;Hollow Frameworks in High Yields for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Anode</title>

         <dc:description>
Liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis and subsequent acid treatment are cleverly used to obtain a high yield of O&#8208;rich carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow framework (NOCNTF&#8208;15) at relatively low temperatures. Ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and experimental results mutually confirm that the NOCNTF&#8208;15 is a high capacity and ultralong life anode for SIBs.








Abstract
Carbon materials have great potential for applications in energy, biology, and environment due to their excellent chemical and physical properties. Their preparation by carbonization methods encounters limitations and the carbon loss during pyrolysis in the form of gaseous molecules results in low yield of carbon materials. Herein a low&#8208;energy (600&#160;&#176;C) and high&#8208;yield (82&#160;wt.%) carbonization strategy is developed using liquid gallium&#8208;assisted pyrolysis of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) affording the N&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (CNT) non&#8208;hollow frameworks encapsulating Co nanoparticles. The liquid gallium layer offers protection against air, promotes heat transfer, and limits the escape of small carbonaceous gaseous molecules, which greatly improve the yields of the pyrolysis reaction. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the synergistic interaction between CNTs and N/O&#8208;containing groups gives a non&#8208;hollow framework composed of N/O&#8208;enriched and open CNTs (NOCNTF&#8208;15, 15 denotes the 15&#160;mm thickness of the liquid gallium layer during the pyrolysis) with high specific capacity (185&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and ultra&#8208;stable cyclability (stable operation at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 and 50&#160;&#176;C for 20&#160;000 cycles). This study provides a unique approach to carbonization that facilitates the practical application of low&#8208;cost CNTs and other MOFs&#8208;derived carbon materials in high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs).

         <title>In situ Blending For Co&#8208;Deposition of Electron Transport and Perovskite Layers Enables Over 24% Efficiency Stable Conventional Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electron transport layer (ETL) materials have been rationally designed for in situ blending to co&#8208;deposit ETL and light&#8208;absorbing layers simultaneously in conventional perovskite solar cells. Such a strategy significantly improves the qualities of perovskite growth and buried interface to improve charge transport/collection. A record high power conversion efficiency over 24% is achieved for organic ETLs based devices.








Abstract
Simplifying the manufacturing processes of multilayered high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is yet of vital importance for their cost&#8208;effective production. Herein, an in situ blending strategy is presented for co&#8208;deposition of electron transport layer (ETL) and perovskite absorber by incorporating (3&#8208;(7&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,3,6,8&#8208;tetraoxo&#8208;3,6,7,8&#8208;tetrahydrobenzo&#8208; [lmn][3,8]phenanthrolin&#8208;2(1H)&#8208;yl)propyl)phosphonic acid (NDP) into the perovskite precursor solutions. The phosphonic acid&#8208;like anchoring group coupled with its large molecular size drives the migration of NDP toward indium tin oxide (ITO) surface to form a distinct ETL during perovskite film forming. This strategy circumvents the critical wetting issue and simultaneously improves the interfacial charge collection efficiencies. Consequently, n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs based on in situ blended NDP achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.01%, which is one of the highest values for PSCs using organic ETLs. This performance is notably higher than that of ETL&#8208;free (21.19%) and independently spin&#8208;coated (21.42%) counterparts. More encouragingly, the in situ blending strategy dramatically enhances the device stability under harsh conditions by retaining over 90% of initial efficiencies after 250&#160;h in 100&#160;&#176;C or 65% humidity storage. Moreover, this strategy is universally adaptable to various perovskite compositions, device architectures, and electron transport materials (ETMs), showing great potential for applications in diverse optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work unravels the water&#8208;effected mechanisms on the metal oxide surface during ethanol oxidation reactions through various in situ surface sensitive spectroscopies: i) the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites leads to water poisoning; ii) the proton&#8208;induced active *OOH species, achieved by accelerated reverse hydrogen spillover among metal oxides, enhances water&#8208;promoted functionality.








Abstract
Understanding the water&#8208;involved mechanism on metal oxide surface and the dynamic interaction of water with active sites is crucial in solving water poisoning in catalytic reactions. Herein, this work solves this problem by designing the water&#8208;promoted function of metal oxides in the ethanol oxidation reaction. In situ multimodal spectroscopies unveil that the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites results in water poisoning and the sluggish proton transfer in CoO&#8208;SnO2 imparts water&#8208;resistant effect. Carbon material as electron donor and proton transport channel optimizes the Co active sites and expedites the reverse hydrogen spillover from CoO to SnO2. The water&#8208;promoted function arises from spillover protons facilitating O2 activation on the SnO2 surface, leading to crucial *OOH intermediate formation for catalyzing C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C cleavage. Consequently, the tailored CoO&#8208;C&#8208;SnO2 showcases a remarkable 60&#8208;fold enhancement in ethanol oxidation reaction compared to bare SnO2 under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

         <title>Achieving High&#8208;Capacity Cathode Presodiation Agent Via Triggering Anionic Oxidation Activity in Sodium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precisely implanting Ni into specific Li sites within the Na2O framework tunes band structures, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion and accelerating the decomposition kinetics of Na2O. It can serve as a cathode presodiation agent to compensate for the irreversible sodium loss during the initial cycling; thus, enhancing the energy density of practical Na&#8208;ion battery full&#8208;cells.








Abstract
Compensating for the irreversible loss of limited active sodium (Na) is crucial for enhancing the energy density of practical sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) full&#8208;cell, especially when employing hard carbon anode with initially lower coulombic efficiency. Introducing sacrificial cathode presodiation agents, particularly those that own potential anionic oxidation activity with a high theoretical capacity, can provide additional sodium sources for compensating Na loss. Herein, Ni atoms are precisely implanted at the Na sites within Na2O framework, obtaining a (Na0.89Ni0.05&#9633;0.06)2O (Ni&#8211;Na2O) presodiation agent. The synergistic interaction between Na vacancies and Ni catalyst effectively tunes the band structure, forming moderate Ni&#8211;O covalent bonds, activating the oxidation activity of oxygen anion, reducing the decomposition overpotential to 2.8&#160;V (vs Na/Na+), and achieving a high presodiation capacity of 710 mAh/g&#8776;Na2O (Na2O decomposition rate &gt;80%). Incorporating currently&#8208;modified presodiation agent with Na3V2(PO4)3 and Na2/3Ni2/3Mn1/3O2 cathodes, the energy density of corresponding Na&#8208;ion full&#8208;cells presents an essential improvement of 23.9% and 19.3%, respectively. Further, not limited to Ni&#8211;Na2O, the structure&#8211;function relationship between the anionic oxidation mechanism and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface fabrication is revealed as a paradigm for the development of sacrificial cathode presodiation agent.

         <title>Homogeneous Fluorine Doping toward Highly Conductive and Stable Li10GeP2S12 Solid Electrolyte for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorine&#8208;doped Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 possesses enhanced stability against moist air and lithium metal due to decreased H2O adsorption energy and formation energy of lithium vacancy, showing nearly one order of magnitude higher ionic conductivity than that of Li10GeP2S12 after air&#8208;exposure. The Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 monolayer solid electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability.








Abstract
The unique structure and exceptionally high lithium ion conductivity over 10&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 of Li10GeP2S12 have gained extensive attention in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. However, its poor resistivity to moisture and chemical/electrochemical incompatibility with lithium metal severely impede its practical application. Herein, a fluorine functionalized Li10GeP2S12 is synthesized by stannous fluoride doping and employed as a monolayer solid electrolyte to realize stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The atomic&#8208;scale mechanism underlying the impact of fluorine doping on both moisture and electrochemical stability of Li10GeP2S12 is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Fluorine surface doping significantly reduces surface hydrophilicity by electronic regulation, thereby retarding the hydrolysis reaction of Li10GeP2S12. After exposed to a relative humidity of 35%&#8211;40% for 20&#160;min, the ionic conductivity of Li9.98Ge0.99Sn0.01P2S11.98F0.02 maintains as high as 2.21&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than that of Li10GeP2S12 with 0.31&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1. Meanwhile, bulk doping of highly electronegative fluorine promotes the formation of lithium vacancies in the Li10GeP2S12 system, thus allowing stable lithium plating/stripping in Li | Li symmetric batteries, boosting a critical current density reaching 2.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The LiCoO2 | lithium all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries display improved cycling stability and rate capability, showing 80.1% retention after 600 cycles at 1C.

         <title>A Versatile Cryomicroneedle Patch for Traceable Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile cryomicroneedle patch (CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for preserving the high activity of HMME and CAT in vitro and improving bioavailability in vivo, which enhances traceable PDT by O2 generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated GSH depletion.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) continues to encounter multifarious hurdles, stemming from the ineffectual preservation and delivery system of photosensitizers, the dearth of imaging navigation, and the antioxidant/hypoxic tumor microenvironment. Herein, a versatile cryomicroneedle patch (denoted as CMN&#8208;CCPH) is developed for traceable PDT. The therapeutic efficacy is further amplified by catalase (CAT)&#8208;induced oxygen (O2) generation and Cu2+&#8208;mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion. The CMN&#8208;CCPH is composed of cryomicroneedle (CMN) as the vehicle and CAT&#8208;biomineralized copper phosphate nanoflowers (CCP NFs) loaded with hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) as the payload. Importantly, the bioactive function of HMME and CAT can be optimally maintained under the protection of CCPH and CMN for a duration surpassing 60 days, leading to bolstered bioavailability and notable enhancements in PDT efficacy. The in vivo visualization of HMME and oxyhemoglobin saturation (sO2) monitored by fluorescence (FL)/photoacoustic (PA) duplex real&#8208;time imaging unveils the noteworthy implications of CMN&#8208;delivered CCPH for intratumoral enrichment of HMME and O2 with reduced systemic toxicity. This versatile CMN patch demonstrates distinct effectiveness in neoplasm elimination, underscoring its promising clinical prospects.

         <title>Embedding Biomimetic Vascular Networks via Coaxial Sacrificial Writing into Functional Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coaxial sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is used to embed biomimetic vascular networks into densely cellular matrices. These coaxially printed and perfusable hierarchical, branching vessels are composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds endothelialized lumens. Using co&#8208;SWIFT, vascularized cardiac tissues are constructed that exhibit synchronous beating, high contractility, and cardio&#8208;effective drug response.








Abstract
Printing human tissues and organs replete with biomimetic vascular networks is of growing interest. While it is possible to embed perfusable channels within acellular and densely cellular matrices, they do not currently possess the biomimetic architectures found in native vessels. Here, coaxial&#160;sacrificial writing into functional tissues (co&#8208;SWIFT) is developed, an embedded bioprinting method capable of generating hierarchically branching, multilayered vascular networks within both granular hydrogel and densely cellular matrices. Coaxial printheads are designed with an extended core&#8211;shell configuration to facilitate robust core&#8211;core and shell&#8211;shell interconnections between printed branching vessels during embedded bioprinting. Using optimized core&#8211;shell ink combinations, biomimetic vessels composed of a smooth muscle cell&#8208;laden shell that surrounds perfusable lumens are coaxially printed into granular matrices composed of: 1) transparent alginate microparticles, 2) sacrificial microparticle&#8208;laden collagen, or 3) cardiac spheroids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Biomimetic blood vessels that exhibit good barrier function are produced by seeding these interconnected lumens with a confluent layer of endothelial cells. Importantly, it is found that co&#8208;SWIFT cardiac tissues mature under perfusion, beat synchronously, and exhibit a cardio&#8208;effective drug response in vitro. This advance opens new avenues for the scalable biomanufacturing of vascularized organ&#8208;specific tissues for drug testing, disease modeling, and therapeutic use.

         <title>Bidirectional, Multilayer MXene/Polyimide Aerogels for Ultra&#8208;Broadband Microwave Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain high&#8208;performance microwave absorption materials, designing structures has proved as a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide aerogel absorbers containing multi&#8208;structures ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscopic are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. The monolayer bidirectional aerogel and its multilayer non&#8208;gradient structure exhibit wide effective absorption bandwidths of 8.58 and 9.41&#160;GHz, respectively.








Abstract
To obtain high&#8208;performance electromagnetic microwave (EM) absorption materials with broad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) and reduced thickness, designing structures has proved to be a promising way. Herein, ultra&#8208;broadband multilayer bidirectional MXene/polyimide EM absorption aerogels containing multi&#8208;structures on scales ranging from the micro&#8208; to the macroscale are produced with the aid of electric and temperature fields. On the microscale, under the action of electric force and temperature gradient, the ordered structures made of aligned Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets and the microscale layered aerogel walls enable the bidirectional aerogel to achieve a wide EAB of 8.58&#160;GHz at a thickness of 2.1&#160;mm. This is ascribed to the numerous aligned nanosheets and layered aerogel walls perpendicular to the incident EMs, facilitating the conversion of electromagnetic energy into electrical energy. Furthermore, on the macroscale, the multilayer bidirectional aerogel with non&#8208;gradient structures effectively resolves the conflict between impedance matching and energy loss, resulting in an ultrawide EAB of 9.41&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3&#160;mm. This innovative design of electric&#8208;field&#8208;assisted multilayer bidirectional aerogels with multiscale structural coupling may provide feasible and effective pathways for the development of advanced EM absorption materials.

         <title>Interstitial Boron Atoms in Pd Aerogel Selectively Switch the Pathway for Glycolic Acid Synthesis from Waste Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
PdB alloy aerogel is synthesized as an anode catalyst for selective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion, achieving a peak mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1 and GA Faraday efficiency of 93.8%. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations uncover the ligand effect and oxophilicity enhancement originating from B incorporation synergistically regulate the adsorption and conversion of key intermediates, thereby allowing the highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;reforming of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into valuable chemicals is garnering significant attention as it opens a mild avenue for waste resource utilization. However, achieving high activity and selectivity for valuable C2 products during ethylene glycol (EG) oxidation in PET hydrolysate on Pd electrocatalysts remains challenging. The strong interaction between Pd and carbonyl (*CO) intermediates leads to undesirable over&#8208;oxidation and poisoning of Pd sites, which hinders the highly efficient C2 products production. Herein, a nonmetallic alloying strategy is employed to fabricate a Pd&#8208;boron alloy aerogel (PdB), wherein B atoms are induced to regulate the electron structure and surface oxophilicity. This approach allows a remarkable mass activity of 6.71 A mgPd&#8722;1, glycolic acid (GA) Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 93.8%, and stable 100 h cyclic electrolysis. In situ experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal the contributions of B inserted in Pd lattice on highly effective EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA conversion. Interestingly, the heightened surface oxophilicity and regulated electronic structure by B incorporation weakened *CO intermediates adsorption and enhanced hydroxyl species affinity to accelerate oxidative *OH adspecies formation, thereby synergistically avoiding over&#8208;oxidation and boosting GA synthesis. This work provides valuable insights for the rational design of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for GA synthesis via an oxophilic B motifs incorporation strategy.

         <title>Fully 3D&#8208;Printed Miniature Soft Hydraulic Actuators with Shape Memory Effect for Morphing and Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving both rich shape morphing and shape locking remains challenging in miniature soft actuators. Fully multi&#8208;material 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect are reported. They can achieve programable fast, versatile 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape morphing, temporary shape locking, and shape recovery for applications in non&#8208;invasive and delicate grasping and energy&#8208;saving manipulators.








Abstract
Miniature shape&#8208;morphing soft actuators driven by external stimuli and fluidic pressure hold great promise in morphing matter and small&#8208;scale soft robotics. However, it remains challenging to achieve both rich shape morphing and shape locking in a fast and controlled way due to the limitations of actuation reversibility and fabrication. Here, fully 3D&#8208;printed, sub&#8208;millimeter thin&#8208;plate&#8208;like miniature soft hydraulic actuators with shape memory effect (SME) for programable fast shape morphing and shape locking, are reported. It combines commercial high&#8208;resolution multi&#8208;material 3D printing of stiff shape memory polymers (SMPs) and soft elastomers and direct printing of microfluidic channels and 2D/3D channel networks embedded in elastomers in a single print run. Leveraging spatial patterning of hybrid compositions and expansion heterogeneity of microfluidic channel networks for versatile hydraulically actuated shape morphing, including circular, wavy, helical, saddle, and warping shapes with various curvatures, are demonstrated. The morphed shapes can be temporarily locked and recover to their original planar forms repeatedly by activating SME of the SMPs. Utilizing the fast shape morphing and locking in the miniature actuators, their potential applications in non&#8208;invasive manipulation of small&#8208;scale objects and fragile living organisms, multimodal entanglement grasping, and energy&#8208;saving manipulators, are demonstrated.

         <title>Constructing Pd and Cu Crowding Single Atoms by Protein Confinement to Promote Sonogashira Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a convenient protein confinement strategy that tightly locates crowded&#160;Pd and Cu single atoms to promote the substrate activation and transmetallation in the Sonogashira reaction. These results provide important clues for the efficient construction of high&#8208;performance heterogeneous catalysts with multiple neighboring active centers and&#160;achieving valuable organic transformations cocatalyzed by multiple active centers.








Abstract
For multicenter&#8208;catalyzed reactions, it is important to accurately construct heterogeneous catalysts containing multiple active centers with high activity and low cost, which&#160;is more challenging compared to homogeneous catalysts because of the low activity and spatial confinement of active centers in the loaded state. Herein, a convenient protein confinement strategy is reported to locate Pd and Cu single atoms in crowding state on carbon coated alumina for promoting Sonogashira reaction, the most powerful method for constructing the acetylenic moiety in molecules. The single&#8208;atomic Pd and Cu centers take advantage in not only the maximized atomic utilization for low cost, but also the much&#8208;enhanced performance by facilitating the activation of aryl halides and alkynes. Their locally crowded dispersion brings them closer to each other, which facilitates the transmetallation process of acetylide intermediates between them. Thus, the Sonogashira reaction is drove smoothly by the obtained catalyst with a turnover frequency value of 313 h&#8722;1, much more efficiently than that by commercial Pd/C and CuI catalyst, conventional Pd and Cu nanocatalysts, and mixed Pd and Cu single&#8208;atom catalyst. The obtained catalyst also exhibits the outstanding durability in the recycling test.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synchronous switching strategy is developed to enhance the real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). It can improve the real&#8208;time powering performance of TENG for sensors to 5&#8211;7 times, comparable to a commercial constant voltage source; and make it possible to enhance the charging performance of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source is a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. This work proposes a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>Adhesion&#8208;Controlled Heterogeneous Nucleation of Tin Halide Perovskites for Eco&#8208;Friendly Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of tin halide perovskites are regulated by incorporating CsF into the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer to adjust the adhesive strength of interfaces. As a result, FASnI2Br&#8211;CsF indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) achieve an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.12%. Ultimately, the utilization of tin halide perovskite IPVs to power radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors is successfully explored.








Abstract
The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has accelerated the advancement of indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) that directly power wireless IoT devices. The interest in lead&#8208;free perovskites for IPVs stems from their similar optoelectronic properties to high&#8208;performance lead halide perovskites, but without concerns about toxic lead leakage in indoor environments. However, currently prevalent lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs, especially tin halide perovskites (THPs), still exhibit inferior performance, arising from their uncontrollable crystallization. Here, a novel adhesive bonding strategy is proposed for precisely regulating heterogeneous nucleation kinetics of THPs by introducing alkali metal fluorides. These ionic adhesives boost the work of adhesion at the buried interface between substrates and perovskite film, subsequently reducing the contact angle and energy barrier for heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in high&#8208;quality THP films. The resulting THP solar cells achieve an efficiency of 20.12% under indoor illumination at 1000 lux, exceeding all types of lead&#8208;free perovskite IPVs and successfully powering radio frequency identification&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Needle&#8208;Like Multifunctional Biphasic Microfiber for Minimally Invasive Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The needle&#8208;like stretchable multifunctional microfiber for minimally invasive bioelectronics is developed, featuring a liquid metal core&#8208;nanocomposite shell structure. This design allows stiffness control based on phase transition and offers advantageous properties of both materials such as softness, stretchability, conductivity, and strain&#8208;insensitivity. Further functionalization enhances its biosensing and stimulation capabilities, showing promise for clinical translation across various in vivo applications.








Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics has attracted significant attention in electroceuticals and clinical medicine for precise diagnosis and efficient treatment of target diseases. However, conventional rigid implantable devices face challenges such as poor tissue&#8208;device interface and unavoidable tissue damage during surgical implantation. Despite continuous efforts to utilize various soft materials to address such issues, their practical applications remain limited. Here, a needle&#8208;like stretchable microfiber composed of a phase&#8208;convertible liquid metal (LM) core and a multifunctional nanocomposite shell for minimally invasive soft bioelectronics is reported. The sharp tapered microfiber can be stiffened by freezing akin to a conventional needle to penetrate soft tissue with minimal incision. Once implanted in vivo where the LM melts, unlike conventional stiff needles, it regains soft mechanical properties, which facilitate a seamless tissue&#8208;device interface. The nanocomposite incorporating with functional nanomaterials exhibits both low impedance and the ability to detect physiological pH, providing biosensing and stimulation capabilities. The fluidic LM embedded in the nanocomposite shell enables high stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitive electrical properties. This multifunctional biphasic microfiber conforms to the surfaces of the stomach, muscle, and heart, offering a promising approach for electrophysiological recording, pH sensing, electrical stimulation, and radiofrequency ablation in vivo.

         <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Iron&#8208;Catalyzed Graphitization: The First Observation of Homogeneous Solid&#8208;State Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalytic graphitization is a simple and flexible route to graphitic carbons from biomass or organic precursors. Here, it is shown that the mechanism of graphitization involves a new type of catalysis where all components are in the solid state. This has broad implications in the important world of carbon but also more widely in materials science.








Abstract
Carbon is a critical material for existing and emerging energy applications and there is considerable global effort in generating sustainable carbons. A particularly promising area is iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization, which is the conversion of organic matter to graphitic carbon nanostructures by an iron catalyst. In this paper, it is reported that iron&#8208;catalyzed graphitization occurs via a new type of mechanism that is called homogeneous solid&#8208;state catalysis. Dark field in situ transmission electron microscopy is used to demonstrate that crystalline iron nanoparticles &#8220;burrow&#8221; through amorphous carbon to generate multiwalled graphitic nanotubes. The process is remarkably fast, particularly given the solid phase of the catalyst, and in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to demonstrate that graphitization is complete within a few minutes.

         <title>Enhanced SWIR Light Detection in Organic Semiconductor Photodetectors through Up&#8208;Conversion of Mid&#8208;Gap Trap States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for creating shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photo&#8208;response in organic photodiodes by utilizing mid&#8208;gap states through &#8216;trap&#8208;doping&#8217; is presented. This involves incorporating small amounts of a guest organic molecule into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;SWIR broadband organic photodiode is demonstrated.








Abstract
Shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photodetectors are vital for many scientific and industrial applications including surveillance, quality control and inspection. In recent decades, photodetectors based on organic semiconductors have emerged, demonstrating potential to add real value to broadband and narrowband imaging and sensing scenarios, where factors such as thermal budget sensitivity, large area aperture necessity, cost considerations, and lightweight and conformal flexibility demands are prioritized. It is now recognized that the performance of organic photodetectors (OPDs), notably their specific detectivity, is ultimately limited by trap states, universally present in disordered semiconductors. This work adopts an approach of utilizing these mid&#8208;gap states to specifically create a SWIR photo&#8208;response. To this end, this work introduces a somewhat counter&#8208;intuitive approach of &#8220;trap&#8208;doping&#8221; in bulk heterojunction (BHJs) photodiodes, where small quantities of a guest organic molecule are intentionally incorporated into a semiconducting donor:acceptor host system. Following this approach, this work demonstrates a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a visible&#8208;to&#8208;SWIR broadband OPD, approaching (and, to some extent, even exceeding) state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance across critical photodetector metrics. The trap&#8208;doping approach is, even though only a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept currently, broadly applicable to various spectral windows. It represents a new modality for engineering photodetection using the unconventional strategy of turning a limitation into a feature.

         <title>Breaking the Saturation of Sensitivity for Ultrawide Range Flexible Pressure Sensors by Soft&#8208;Strain Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for pressure sensing is demonstrated for breaking through the saturation of electrical responses and sensitivity. The strain&#8208;effect&#8208;based pressure sensors can generate increased resistance changes with tensile strain of conductive films over an overwide linear detection range (over 1.5 MPa), and obtain unsaturated electrical response changes&#160;over 100% (from 5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1).








Abstract
The flexible pressure sensors with a broad pressure range and unsaturated sensitivity are highly desired in practical applications. However, pressure sensors by piezoresistive effect are always limited by the compressibility of sensing layers, resulting in a theoretically decreasing sensitivity of less than 100%. Here, a unique strategy is proposed that utilizes the strain effect, simultaneously achieving a trade&#8208;off between a wider pressure detection range and unsaturated sensitivity. Ascribed to the strain effect of sensing layers induced by interlaced microdomes, the sensors possess an increased sensitivity (5.22&#8211;70 MPa&#8722;1) over an ultrawide pressure range (45 Pa&#8211;4.1 MPa), a high&#8208;pressure resolution (5 Pa), fast response/recovery time (30/45 ms), and a robust response under a high&#8208;pressure loading of 3.5 MPa for more than 5000 cycles. These superior sensing performances allow the sensor to monitor large pressure. The flexible pressure sensor array can assist doctors in restoring the neutral mechanical axis, tracking knee flexion angles, and extracting gait features. Moreover, the flexible sensing array can be integrated into the joint motion surveillance system to map the balance medial&#8211;lateral contact forces on the metal compartments in real time, demonstrating the potential for further development into precise medical human&#8211;machine interfaces during total knee replacement surgery.

         <title>Interference of ATP&#8208;Adenosine Axis by Engineered Biohybrid for Amplifying Immunogenic Cell Death&#8208;Mediated Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF) is rationally designed to activate immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#160;therapy and impede the production of immunosuppressive adenosine, which can establish a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity and activate the enduring immunological memory to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, thereby amplifying ICD&#8208;mediated antitumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) often results in the production and accumulation of adenosine (ADO), a byproduct that negatively impacts the therapeutic effect as well as facilitates tumor development and metastasis. Here, an innovative strategy is elaborately developed to effectively activate ICD while avoiding the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine. Specifically, ZIF&#8208;90, an ATP&#8208;responsive consumer, is synthesized as the core carrier to encapsulate AB680 (CD73 inhibitor) and then coated with an iron&#8208;polyphenol layer to prepare the ICD inducer (AZTF), which is further grafted onto prebiotic bacteria via the esterification reaction to obtain the engineered biohybrid (Bc@AZTF). Particularly, the designed Bc@AZTF can actively enrich in tumor sites and respond to the acidic tumor microenvironment to offload AZTF nanoparticles, which can consume intracellular ATP (iATP) content and simultaneously inhibit the ATP&#8208;adenosine axis to reduce the accumulation of adenosine, thereby alleviating adenosine&#8208;mediated immunosuppression and strikingly amplifying ICD effect. Importantly, the synergy of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 (&#945;PD&#8208;1) with Bc@AZTF not only establishes a collaborative antitumor immune network to potentiate effective tumoricidal immunity but also activates long&#8208;lasting immune memory effects to manage tumor recurrence and rechallenge, presenting a new paradigm for ICD treatment combined with adenosine metabolism.

         <title>An Electrolyte Engineered Homonuclear Copper Complex as Homogeneous Catalyst for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) with a Cu atom proximal distance of 4.7 &#197; is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the lithium&#8211;sulfur redox reactions. The optimized content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaches the saturated concentration of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T in electrolyte, further boosting its homogeneous optimization activity.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries suffer from severe polysulfide shuttle, retarded sulfur conversion kinetics and notorious lithium dendrites, which has curtailed the discharge capacity, cycling lifespan and safety. Engineered catalysts act as a feasible strategy to synchronously manipulate the evolution behaviors of sulfur and lithium species. Herein, a chlorine bridge&#8208;enabled binuclear copper complex (Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T) is in situ synthesized in electrolyte as homogeneous catalyst for rationalizing the Li&#8211;S redox reactions. The well&#8208;designed Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T provides completely active sites and sufficient contact for homogeneously guiding the Li2S nucleation/decomposition reactions, and stabilizing the lithium working interface according to the synchrotron radiation X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography, small angle neutron scattering and COMSOL results. Moreover, Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T with the content of 0.25&#160;wt% approaching saturated concentration in electrolyte further boosts the homogeneous optimization function in really operated Li&#8211;S batteries. Accordingly, the capacity retention of the Li&#8211;S battery is elevated from 51.4% to 86.3% at 0.2 C, and reaches 77.0% at 1.0 C over 400 cycles. Furthermore, the sulfur cathode with the assistance of Cu&#8208;2&#8208;T realizes the stable cycling under the practical scenarios of soft&#8208;packaged pouch cell and high sulfur loading (6.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 with the electrolyte usage of 4.5&#160;&#181;L mgS&#8722;1).

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism for Microstructure Engineering toward High&#8208;Capacity Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>

An increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle is achieved in a tungsten(W)&#8208;introduced cathode through microstructure regulation. The modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries can effectively promote lithium ion&#160;transport and thus endow capacity enhancement. This work provides insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship for the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode.









Abstract
Microstructural engineering on nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing high valence&#8208;state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, it is demonstrated that an increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which can lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity&#8208;increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity&#8208; and lifespan&#8208;increased NRLOs.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Carbon Potassium&#8208;Ion Capacitor Enabled by Hollow Carbon Fibrous Electrodes with Reduced Graphitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2 ceramic nanofibers are employed as the catalytic template to fabricate hollow tubular N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon nanofibers, which has high tensile strength, robust structural flexibility, and excellent electronic conductivity. High K+&#8208;storage capacity at low plateau potential and fast K+&#8208;intercalation kinetics are achieved to build a flexible K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor.








Abstract
The large size of K+ ions (1.38 &#197;) sets a challenge in achieving high kinetics and long lifespan of potassium storage devices. Here, a fibrous ZrO2 membrane is utilized as a reactive template to construct a dual&#8208;carbon K&#8208;ion capacitor. Unlike graphite, ZrO2&#8208;catalyzed graphitic carbon presents a relatively disordered layer arrangement with an expanded interlayer spacing of 0.378&#160;nm to accommodate K+ insertion/extraction. Pyridine&#8208;derived nitrogen sites can locally store K&#8208;ions without disrupting the formation of stage&#8208;1 graphite intercalation compounds (GICs). Consequently, N&#8208;doped hollow graphitic carbon fiber achieves a K+&#8208;storage capacity (primarily below 1&#160;V), which is 1.5 time that of commercial graphite. Potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors are assembled using the hollow carbon fiber electrodes and the ZrO2 nanofiber membrane as the separator. The capacitor exhibits a high power of 40 000 W&#8201;kg&#8722;1, full charge in 8.5&#8201;s, 93% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 2&#8201;A g&#8722;1, and a low self&#8208;discharge rate of 8.6&#160;mV h&#8722;1. The scalability and high performance of the lattice&#8208;expanded tubular carbon electrodes underscores may advance the practical potassium&#8208;ion capacitors.

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Direct Upcycling of Spent Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes into High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt is utilized to repair highly degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Consequently, upcycled materials can overcome the key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Facing the resource and environmental pressures brought by the retiring wave of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), direct recycling methods are considered to be the next generation's solution. However, the contradiction between limited battery life and the demand for rapidly iterating technology forces the direct recovery paradigm to shift toward &#8220;direct upcycling.&#8221; Herein, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt system is utilized to repair structural defects in degraded polycrystalline LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Upcycled materials can effectively overcome the two key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution. It exhibits comprehensive electrochemical performance far superior to commercial materials at 4.6&#160;V, especially its fast charging capability at 15&#160;C, and an impressive 91.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles in a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell. Importantly, this approach demonstrates broad applicability to various spent layered cathodes, particularly showcasing its value in the recycling of mixed spent cathodes. This work effectively bridges the gap between waste management and material performance enhancement, offering a sustainable path for the recycling of spent LIBs and the production of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage cathodes.

Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. With customizable processing forms, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, recyclability, and biodegradability. The diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Ubiquitous anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials with a rapidly rising annual consumption (over 1010&#160;m2) can pose a serious environmental burden. Biobased cellulosic materials with birefringence offer attractive sustainable alternatives, but their scalable solvent&#8208;free processing remain challenging. Here, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure of preferred oriented cellulose, the strategy balances the contradiction between the strong confinement of long&#8208;range ordered structures and the molecular motility required for entropically&#8208;driven reconstruction. Equipped with customizable processing forms including mold&#8208;pressing, spinning, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, and blade&#8208;coating, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, self&#8208;healing efficiency (94.5%), recyclability, and biodegradability. Moreover, the diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The strategy is expected to provide references for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of cellulose and promote sustainable innovation in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting industry.

         <title>Bioinspired Artificial Visual&#8208;Respiratory Synapse as Multimodal Scene Recognition System with Oxidized&#8208;Vacancies MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse using monolayer vacancy&#8208;induced oxidized MXene is introduced, leveraging synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. Oxidized vacancies exhibit photocarrier trapping and hydroxyl preference, enabling environmental and multimodal neural network image recognition. This device promises advancements in intelligent interactive systems through enhanced sensory integration and responsive neural network functionalities.








Abstract
In the pursuit of artificial neural systems, the integration of multimodal plasticity, memory retention, and perceptual functions stands as a paramount objective in achieving neuromorphic perceptual components inspired by the human brain, to emulating the neurological excitability tuning observed in human visual and respiratory collaborations. Here, an artificial visual&#8208;respiratory synapse is presented with monolayer oxidized MXene (VRSOM) exhibiting synergistic light and atmospheric plasticity. The VRSOM enables to realize facile modulation of synaptic behaviors, encompassing postsynaptic current, sustained photoconductivity, stable facilitation/depression properties, and &#8220;learning&#8208;experience&#8221; behavior. These performances rely on the privileged photocarrier trapping characteristics and the hydroxyl&#8208;preferential selectivity inherent of oxidized vacancies. Moreover, environment recognitions and multimodal neural network image identifications are achieved through multisensory integration, underscoring the potential of the VRSOM in reproducing human&#8208;like perceptual attributes. The VRSOM platform holds significant promise for hardware output of human&#8208;like mixed&#8208;modal interactions and paves the way for perceiving multisensory neural behaviors in artificial interactive devices.

Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding
The anisotropic lubricity between two&#8208;dimensional semiconducting tin selenide nanoplates and a graphene substrate enables the motion of nanoplates strictly along the zigzag direction of graphene. A subsequential in situ annealing welds the nanoplates together and yields defect&#8208;free interfaces. More details can be found in article number 2312199 by Salvador Barraza&#8208;Lopez, Stuart S. P. Parkin, Kai Chang, and co&#8208;workers.

         <dc:description>
This review presents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies to improve the efficiency of 2D PSCs, focusing on component&#160;engineering, crystal&#160;structure and photovoltaic properties. The strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique and interface optimization, are systematically discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites are outlined to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
In the quest for durable photovoltaic devices, 2D halide perovskites have emerged as a focus of extensive research. However, the reduced dimension in structure is accompanied by inferior optical&#8208;electrical properties, such as widened band gap, enhanced exciton binding energy, and obstructed charge transport. As a result, the efficiency of 2D perovskite solar cells (PSCs) lags significantly behind their 3D counterparts. To overcome these constraints, extensive investigations into materials and processing techniques are pursued rigorously to augment the efficiency of 2D PSCs. Herein, The cutting&#8208;edge delve into developments in 2D PSCs, with a focus on chemical and material engineering, as well as their structure and photovoltaic properties. The review starts with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the key evaluation criteria of 2D PSCs. Then, the strategies around solution chemical engineering, processing technique, and interface optimization, to simultaneously boost efficiency and stability are systematically discussed. Finally, the challenges and perspectives associated with 2D perovskites to provide insights into potential improvements in photovoltaic performance will be outlined.

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial strategy has attracted increasing attentions due to its remarkable impact on synergistically optimizing carrier and phonon transport properties. This review overviews and defines five typical interstitials, including rattling, decoupling, interlayer, dynamic, and liquid interstitials. Their transport mechanisms in thermoelectric materials are thoroughly illustrated, and future development directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms are identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial, and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 36, September 5, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast charging alleviates range anxiety in sodium&#8208;ion batteries caused by limited energy density. This review focuses on the fast&#8208;charging design of polyanionic cathodes and proposes innovative modification strategy classifications&#8212;from shortening migration paths to increasing diffusion coefficients. Discussions extend from coin cells to pouch cells, aiming to provide insights into high&#8208;rate polyanionic materials, emphasizing their significant potential in fast&#8208;charging applications.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8211;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics are identified and summarized. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Fast charging alleviates range anxiety in sodium-ion batteries caused by limited energy density. This review focuses on the fast-charging design of polyanionic cathodes and proposes innovative modification strategy classifications&#8212;from shortening migration paths to increasing diffusion coefficients. Discussions extend from coin cells to pouch cells, aiming to provide insights into high-rate polyanionic materials, emphasizing their significant potential in fast-charging applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost-effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8211;acid batteries, particularly in low-speed electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast-charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high-rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast-charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate-limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, key factors that constrain fast-charging characteristics are identified and summarized. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high-rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast-charging SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Wetting behaviors can significantly affect the transport of energy and signal (E&amp;S) through vapor, solid, and liquid interfaces, which has prompted increased interest in interfacial science and technology. E&amp;S transmission can be achieved using electricity, light, and heat, which often accompany and interact with each other. Over the past decade, their distinctive transport phenomena during wetting processes have made significant contributions to various domains. However, few studies have analyzed the intricate relationship between wetting behavior and E&amp;S transport. This review summarizes and discusses the mechanisms of electrical, light, and heat transmission at wetting interfaces to elucidate their respective scientific issues, technical characteristics, challenges, commonalities, and potential for technological convergence. The materials, structures, and devices involved in E&amp;S transportation are also analyzed. Particularly, harnessing synergistic advantages in practical applications and constructing advanced, multifunctional, and highly efficient smart systems based on wetted interfaces is the aim to provide strategies.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
