         <title>Electrode&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Healed Monolayer MoS2 for High Performance Transistors and Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sulfide electrode system allows sulfur&#8208;vacancy self&#8208;healing in 2D MoS2. Ultrathin CuS electrode heals defects in MoS2 channel spontaneously upon mild thermal annealing. The self&#8208;healed CuS/MoS2 transistors and phototransistors show impressive device performance.








Abstract
Contact engineering for monolayered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is considered to be of fundamental challenge for realizing high&#8208;performance TMDCs&#8208;based (opto) electronic devices. Here, an innovative concept is established for a device configuration with metallic copper monosulfide (CuS) electrodes that induces sulfur vacancy healing in the monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channel. Excess sulfur adatoms from the metallic CuS electrodes are donated to heal sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 that surprisingly improve the overall performance of its devices. The electrode&#8208;induced self&#8208;healing mechanism is demonstrated and analyzed systematically using various spectroscopic analyses, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and electrical measurements. Without any passivation layers, the self&#8208;healed MoS2 (photo)transistor with the CuS contact electrodes show outstanding room temperature field effect mobility of 97.6 cm2 (Vs)&#8722;1, On/Off ratio &gt; 108,&#160;low subthreshold swing of 120&#160;mV per decade, high photoresponsivity of 1 &#215; 104&#160;A W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 1013 jones, which are the best among back&#8208;gated transistors that employ 1L MoS2. Using ultrathin and flexible 2D CuS and MoS2, mechanically flexible photosensor is also demonstrated, which shows excellent durability under mechanical strain. These findings demonstrate a promising strategy in TMDCs or other 2D material for the development of high performance and functional devices including self&#8208;healable sulfide electrodes.

         <title>Tunable 2D Group&#8208;III Metal Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Air&#8208;stable large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys with tunable composition and no evidence of phase segregation are realized by confinement heteroepitaxy. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.








Abstract
Chemically stable quantum&#8208;confined 2D metals are of interest in next&#8208;generation nanoscale quantum devices. Bottom&#8208;up design and synthesis of such metals could enable the creation of materials with tailored, on&#8208;demand, electronic and optical properties for applications that utilize tunable plasmonic coupling, optical nonlinearity, epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero behavior, or wavelength&#8208;specific light trapping. In this work, it is demonstrated that the electronic, superconducting, and optical properties of air&#8208;stable 2D metals can be controllably tuned by the formation of alloys. Environmentally robust large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;InxGa1&#8722;x alloys are synthesized byConfinement Heteroepitaxy (CHet). Near&#8208;complete solid solubility is achieved with no evidence of phase segregation, and the composition is tunable over the full range of x by changing the relative elemental composition of the precursor. The optical and electronic properties directly correlate with alloy composition, wherein the dielectric function, band structure, superconductivity, and charge transfer from the metal to graphene are all controlled by the indium/gallium ratio in the 2D metal layer.

         <title>Crystallographic&#8208;Site&#8208;Specific Structural Engineering Enables Extraordinary Electrochemical Performance of High&#8208;Voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Spinel Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering is performed on the cathode material structure, aiming at the root causes of the instability based on the fundamental structure/function relationship. The high&#8208;voltage spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode with Fd3&#175;m space group symmetry is employed as a representative, of which two issue&#8208;involved crystallographic sites are directly and simultaneously addressed, contributing to an extraordinarily excellent battery performance.








Abstract
The development of reliable and safe high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries is hindered by the structural instability of cathode materials during cycling, arising as a result of detrimental phase transformations occurring at high operating voltages alongside the loss of active materials induced by transition metal dissolution. Originating from the fundamental structure/function relation of battery materials, the authors purposefully perform crystallographic&#8208;site&#8208;specific structural engineering on electrode material structure, using the high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathode as a representative, which directly addresses the root source of structural instability of the Fd3&#175;m structure. By employing Sb as a dopant to modify the specific issue&#8208;involved 16c and 16d sites simultaneously, the authors successfully transform the detrimental two&#8208;phase reaction occurring at high&#8208;voltage into a preferential solid&#8208;solution reaction and significantly suppress the loss of Mn from the LNMO structure. The modified LNMO material delivers an impressive 99% of its theoretical specific capacity at 1 C, and maintains 87.6% and 72.4% of initial capacity after 1500 and 3000 cycles, respectively. The issue&#8208;tracing site&#8208;specific structural tailoring demonstrated for this material will facilitate the rapid development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Variability and Yield in h&#8208;BN&#8208;Based Memristive Circuits: The Role of Each Type of Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large (up to 10 kbit) crossbar arrays of nano&#8208;memristors (down to 320&#160;nm &#215; 420&#160;nm) using hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) are fabricated, and their yield and variability are studied. The atomic defects in h&#8208;BN deviate the electrical characteristics of the devices, while wrinkles, polymer residues, thicker islands, and gaps with the substrate have no remarkable effect.








Abstract
In the race of fabricating solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic devices using 2D layered materials (LMs), achieving high yield and low device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability are the two main challenges. Electronic devices that drive currents in&#8208;plane and homogeneously along the 2D&#8208;LMs (i.e., transistors, memtransistors) are strongly affected by local defects (i.e., grain boundaries, wrinkles, thickness fluctuations, polymer residues), as they create inhomogeneities and increase the device&#8208;to&#8208;device variability, resulting in a poor performance at the circuit level. Here, it is shown that memristors are insensitive to most types of defects in 2D&#8208;LMs, even when fabricated in academic laboratories that do not meet industrial standards. The reason is that the currents produced in these devices, which flow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane across the 2D&#8208;LM, are always driven locally by the most conductive locations. Consequently, it is concluded that it is much easier to fabricate 2D&#8208;LMs&#8208;based solid&#8208;state nano/microelectronic circuits using memristors than using transistors or memtransistors, not only due to the inherent simpler fabrication process (i.e., less lithography steps) but also because the local defects do not degrade the yield and variability of memristors considerably.

&lt;p&gt;In the race of fabricating solid-state nano/microelectronic devices using 2D layered materials (LMs), achieving high yield and low device-to-device variability are the two main challenges. Electronic devices that drive currents in-plane and homogeneously along the 2D-LMs (i.e., transistors, memtransistors) are strongly affected by local defects (i.e., grain boundaries, wrinkles, thickness fluctuations, polymer residues), as they create inhomogeneities and increase the device-to-device variability, resulting in a poor performance at the circuit level.

         <title>Multichannel Piezo&#8208;Ultrasound Implant with Hybrid Waterborne Acoustic Metastructure for Selective Wireless Energy Transfer at Megahertz Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is proposed, which integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure, multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The optimized device structure that utilizes a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator provides the advantage of ultrasound frequency selectivity for in vivo multifunctional operations.








Abstract
Ultrasound energy transfer (UET) is developed and integrated into various bioelectronics with diagnostic, therapeutic, and monitoring capabilities. However, existing UET platforms generally enable one function at a time due to the single ultrasound channel architecture, limiting the full potential of bioelectronics that requires multicontrol modes. Here, a multichannel piezo&#8208;ultrasound implant (MC&#8208;PUI) is presented that integrates a hybrid waterborne acoustic metastructure (HWAM), multiple piezo&#8208;harvesters, and a miniaturized circuit with electronic components for selective wireless control via ultrasound frequency switching. The HWAM that utilizes both a 3D&#8208;printed air&#8208;diffraction matrix and a half&#8208;lambda Fabry&#8211;Perot resonator is optimized to provide the advantage of ultrasound selectivity at megahertz frequencies. Complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations, frequency&#8208;controlled multifunctional operations, such as wireless charging (&#8776;11.08 &#181;W) at 3.3&#160;MHz and high&#8208;sensitivity wireless switch/control (threshold &#8776;0.55&#160;MPa) of micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode/motor at 1&#160;MHz, are demonstrated ex vivo using porcine tissue and in vivo in a rat. The developed MC&#8208;PUI enhances UET versatility and opens up a new pathway for wireless implant design.

         <title>Suppressing Interface Strain for Eliminating Double&#8208;Slope Behaviors: Towards Ideal Conformable Polymer Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface strain between film and substrate is first found to play the crucial role in determining device ideality. The release of strain by peeling can reduce the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance, which decreases oxygen doped carriers, thereby realizing ideal PFETs. The work clarifies the effect of interface strain on the device ideality, offering useful guidance for constructing ideal conformable PFETs.








Abstract
High&#8208;mobility polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) are being actively explored for applications in soft electronic skin and low&#8208;cost flexible displays because of their superior solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and stretchability. However, most of high&#8208;mobility PFETs often deviate from the idealized behavior with variable mobility, large threshold voltage, and high off&#8208;state current, which masks their intrinsic properties and significantly impedes their practical applications. Here, it is first revealed that interface strain between polymer thin film and rigid substrate plays a crucial role in determining the ideality of PFETs, and demonstrate that various ideal conformable PFETs can be successfully fabricated by releasing strain. It is found that strain in film can be released by one&#8208;step peeling strategy, which can reduce &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and suppress generation of oxygen doped carriers, thereby obtaining linearly injected charge carriers and decreased carrier concentration in channel, eventually realizing ideal PFETs. More impressively, the fabricated ideal conformable PFET array displays outstanding conformability to curved objects, and meanwhile showing excellent organic light&#8208;emitting display driving capability. The work clarifies the effect of the interface strain on the device ideality, and strain can be effectively released by a facile peeling strategy, thus offering useful guidance for the construction of ideal conformable PFETs.

         <title>The Interfacial Electronic Engineering in Binary Sulfiphilic Cobalt Boride Heterostructure Nanosheets for Upgrading Energy Density and Longevity of Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of binary sulfiphilic cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron&#8208;codoped porous carbon (NBC), has been fabricated through molten salt&#8208;assisted strategy using ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;encapsulated ZIF&#8208;8 as precursors. Strong interfacial electronic interactions between CoB and NBC endow the CoB/NBC&#8208;S electrode with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities and long lifetime in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
High gravimetric, areal and volumetric capacities together with long lifetime are key indexes for the applications of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries in compact space. The sulfur host materials play pivotal roles in the practical deployment. Herein, one type of new heterostructure nanosheets composed of cobalt boride (CoB) on nitrogen, boron&#8208;codoped porous carbon (NBC), which is constructed through molten salt&#8208;assisted strategy using ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;encapsulated ZIF&#8208;8 as precursors is reported on. Benefiting from strong interfacial electronic interactions between binary sulfiphilic CoB and porous NBC, the CoB/NBC&#8208;S electrode exhibits the excellent cycling stability with low average capacity decay of 0.013% in ultralong 1500 cycles at high rate of 5 C. Remarkably, the electrode with high sulfur content of 82 wt% and high sulfur loading of 5.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers gravimetric capacity of 1309&#160;mA h g&#8722;1, areal capacity of 7.59&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2, and volumetric capacity of 1355&#160;mA h cm&#8722;3 at 0.1 C. The favorable electrochemical performance can rival with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of those in the reported nanosheets&#8208;based sulfur cathodes. This study provides new methodology for the design of heterostructure nanosheets of metal borides to achieve energy density and longevity of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Efficient Ion Sieving in Covalent Organic Framework Membranes with Sub&#8208;2&#8208;Nanometer Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin covalent organic framework membranes are constructed, where abundant hydrogen bonding sites are lined in the 1D sub&#8208;2&#8208;nm sized channels. The hydrogen&#8208;bond binding interaction between the hydrogen bonding sites and hydrated divalent cations are stronger than that of monovalent cations, enabling efficient metal ion sieving under concentration gradient driven.








Abstract
Membranes of sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer channels show high ion transport rates, but it remains a great challenge to design such membranes with desirable ion selectivities for ion separation applications. Here, covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with a channel size of &#8776;1.4&#160;nm and abundant hydrogen bonding sites, exhibiting efficient ion sieving properties are demonstrated. The COF membranes have high monovalent cation permeation rates of 0.1&#8211;0.2&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and extremely low multivalent cation permeabilities, leading to high monovalent over divalent ion selectivities for K+/Mg2+ of &#8776;765, Na+/Mg2+ of &#8776;680, and Li+/Mg2+ of &#8776;217. Experimental measurements and theoretical simulations reveal that the hydrogen bonding interaction between hydrated cations and the COF channel wall governs the high selectivity, and divalent cations transport through the channel needs to overcome higher energy barriers than monovalent cations. These findings provide an effective strategy for developing sub&#8208;2&#8208;nanometer sized membranes with specific interaction sites for high&#8208;efficiency ionic separation.

         <title>Nanoporous NiSb to Enhance Nitrogen Electroreduction via Tailoring Competitive Adsorption Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isolating nitrogen and proton adsorption sites is an efficient strategy to improve the catalytic performance for electrochemical nitrogen reduction. Nanoporous NiSb provides separated binding sites for adsorption of H+ and N2, and optimizes the adsorption of nitrogen reduction reaction intermediates due to the electrons modulation of Sb to Ni, resulting in the improved NH3 yield and Faradaic efficiency.








Abstract
Ambient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is attracting extensive interest but still suffers from sluggish kinetics owing to competitive rapid hydrogen evolution and difficult nitrogen activation. Herein, nanoporous NiSb alloy is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for N2 fixation, achieving a high ammonia yield rate of 56.9 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 48.0%. Density functional theory calculations reveal that in NiSb alloy, Ni favors N2 hydrogenation while the neighboring Sb separates active sites for proton and N2 adsorption, which optimizes the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and enables an energetically favorable NRR pathway.

&lt;p&gt;Isolating nitrogen and proton adsorption sites is an efficient strategy to improve the catalytic performance for electrochemical nitrogen reduction. Nanoporous NiSb provides separated binding sites for adsorption of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and optimizes the adsorption of nitrogen reduction reaction intermediates due to the electrons modulation of Sb to Ni, resulting in the improved NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield and Faradaic efficiency.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambient nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is attracting extensive interest but still suffers from sluggish kinetics owing to competitive rapid hydrogen evolution and difficult nitrogen activation. Herein, nanoporous NiSb alloy is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation, achieving a high ammonia yield rate of 56.9 &lt;b&gt;&#181;&lt;/b&gt;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency of 48.0%. Density functional theory calculations reveal that in NiSb alloy, Ni favors N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation while the neighboring Sb separates active sites for proton and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption, which optimizes the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and enables an energetically favorable NRR pathway. This work indicates promising electrocatalytic application of the alloys of 3d and p block metals toward the NRR and provides an intriguing strategy to enhance the reduction of inert molecules by restraining the competitive hydrogen adsorption.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Lithium Fluoride in Electrolyte for Stable and Safe Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte engineering via fluorinated additives is promising to improve the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal batteries. The electrolyte in active porous LiF nanobox involves the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content (&gt;30%) solid electrolyte interphase layer to achieve a &#8776;3.5 Ah Li || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell with a specific energy of 380 Wh kg&#8722;1 under a practical carbonate electrolyte.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering via fluorinated additives is promising to improve cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;metal batteries. Here, an electrolyte is reported in a porous lithium fluoride (LiF) strategy to enable efficient carbonate electrolyte engineering for stable and safe Li&#8208;metal batteries. Unlike traditionally engineered electrolytes, the prepared electrolyte in the porous LiF nanobox exhibits nonflammability and high electrochemical performance owing to strong interactions between the electrolyte solvent molecules and numerous exposed active LiF (111) crystal planes. Via cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy depth analysis, it is revealed that the electrolyte in active porous LiF nanobox involves the formation of a high&#8208;fluorine&#8208;content (&gt;30%) solid electrolyte interphase layer, which enables very stable Li&#8208;metal anode cycling over one thousand cycles under high current density (4 mA cm&#8722;2). More importantly, employing the porous LiF nanobox engineered electrolyte, a Li || LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cell is achieved with a specific energy of 380 Wh kg&#8722;1 for stable cycling over 80 cycles, representing the excellent performance of the Li&#8208;metal pouch cell using practical carbonate electrolyte. This study provides a new electrolyte engineering strategy for stable and safe Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Uncovering the Promotion of CeO2/CoS1.97 Heterostructure with Specific Spatial Architectures on Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two novel CeO2/CoS1.97 heterostructure electrocatalysts (CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97 and CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2) are constructed to investigate the relationships between spatial architectures and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, where different configuration endows hybrids with distinct intermediate adsorption, modulated electronic structures, and promoted electrochemical reconstruction, thus improving the OER kinetics and performances. This work sheds light on the importance of rational design and synthesis of advanced hybrid electrocatalysts with functional spatial architectures.








Abstract
Structural engineering and compositional controlling are extensively applied in rationally designing and fabricating advanced freestanding electrocatalysts. The key relationship between the spatial distribution of components and enhanced electrocatalysis performance still needs further elaborate elucidation. Here, CeO2 substrate supported CoS1.97 (CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97) and CoS1.97 with CeO2 surface decorated (CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2) materials are constructed to comprehensively investigate the origin of spatial architectures for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). CeO2&#8208;CoS1.97 exhibits a low overpotential of 264&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 due to the stable heterostructure and faster mass transfer. Meanwhile, CoS1.97&#8208;CeO2 has a smaller Tafel slope of 49&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 through enhanced adsorption of OH&#8722;, fast electron transfer, and in situ formation of Co(IV)O2 species under the OER condition. Furthermore, operando spectroscopic characterizations combined with theoretical calculations demonstrate that spatial architectures play a distinguished role in modulating the electronic structure and promoting the reconstruction from sulfide to oxyhydroxide toward higher chemical valence. The findings highlight spatial architectures and surface reconstruction in designing advanced electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Biodegradable Small&#8208;Scale Swimmers for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their motion abilities, micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers are proposed as minimally invasive tools for precision healthcare applications. When designed for temporary treatments, these devices should exhibit the ability to degrade in the body with minimal disruption after accomplishing their designated tasks. Here, recent research efforts are summarized on the topic of biodegradable micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Most forms of biomatter are ephemeral, which means they transform or deteriorate after a certain time. From this perspective, implantable healthcare devices designed for temporary treatments should exhibit the ability to degrade and either blend in with healthy tissues, or be cleared from the body with minimal disruption after accomplishing their designated tasks. This topic is currently being investigated in the field of biomedical micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers. These tiny devices have the ability to move through fluids by converting physical or chemical energy into motion. Several architectures of these devices have been designed to mimic the motion strategies of nature's motile microorganisms and cells. Due to their motion abilities, these devices have been proposed as minimally invasive tools for precision healthcare applications. Hence, a natural progression in this field is to produce motile structures that can adopt, or even surpass, similar transient features as biological systems. The fate of small&#8208;scale swimmers after accomplishing their therapeutic mission is critical for the successful translation of small&#8208;scale swimmers&#8217; technologies into clinical applications. In this review, recent research efforts are summarized on the topic of biodegradable micro&#8208; and nanoswimmers for biomedical applications, with a focus on targeted therapeutic delivery.

         <title>On&#8208;Surface Polymerization of In&#8208;Plane Highly Ordered Carbon Nitride Nanosheets toward Photocatalytic Mineralization of Mercaptan Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In&#8208;plane highly ordered carbon nitride nanosheets with low structural defects synthesized by on&#8208;surface polymerization endows it with strong sulfation&#8208;resistant ability and good reusability for complete photocatalytic mineralization of mercaptans. This study highlights the on&#8208;surface polymerization technique which opens up the prospect of the construction of an atomically controlled nanostructure with potentially advantageous properties that cannot otherwise be synthesized.








Abstract
2D carbon nitride nanosheets have attracted ever&#8208;increasing interest in photocatalysis due to their unique structural advantages. However, the nanosheets synthesized by the traditional methods, such as post oxidation and liquid exfoliation, have suffered from in&#8208;plane disorder with abundant structural defects, which seriously counteracts their structural benefits for photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that polymer carbon nitride nanosheets with in&#8208;plane highly ordered structure (PCNNs&#8208;IHO) can be successfully prepared by on&#8208;surface polymerization of melamine on NaCl crystal surface at elevated temperatures. The NaCl crystals with relative high surface energy not only facilitate the adsorption and activation of melamine to undergo condensation reaction, but also function as unique substrates to orientate the assembly of 2D nanosheet structure. In addition, NaCl also acts as a reactant to provide Na+ doping into carbon nitride matrix, affording PCNNs&#8208;IHO with robust structural base sites. Benefiting from this structural basicity, PCNNs&#8208;IHO exhibits superior photocatalytic performance toward CH3SH mineralization under visible light irradiation.

         <title>Nanosecond&#8208;Pulsed Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed pulsed operation of perovskite light emitting diodes is achieved with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns. The temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Furthermore, the integration of Bragg gratings enhances the forward radiance more than two&#8208;fold, with a maximum of approximately 1200 kW sr&#8722;1m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
While metal&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold the potential for a new generation of display and lighting technology, their slow operation speed and response time limit their application scope. Here, high&#8208;speed PeLEDs driven by nanosecond electrical pulses with a rise time of 1.2&#160;ns are reported with a maximum radiance of approximately 480 kW sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.3 kA cm&#8722;2, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1% at approximately 10 kA cm&#8722;2, through improved device configuration designs and material considerations. Enabled by the fast operation of PeLEDs, the temporal response provides access to transient charge carrier dynamics under electrical excitation, revealing several new electroluminescence quenching pathways. Finally, integrated distributed feedback (DFB) gratings are explored, which facilitate more directional light emission with a maximum radiance of approximately 1200 kW&#8197;sr&#8722;1&#8197;m&#8722;2 at 8.5 kA cm&#8722;2, a more than two&#8208;fold enhancement to forward radiation output.

         <title>Secondary Bonding Channel Design Induces Intercalation Pseudocapacitance toward Ultrahigh&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional organic electrode relies on functional groups. In this work, the organic compound 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid is used as an example to reveal that secondary bonds for molecular stacking are connected together to form 3D channels for Li+&#8208;ion intercalation. The secondary bonding channels comprising &#63743;C&#63742;C&#63743; redox sites are identified to display intercalation pseudocapacitance, playing an important role in increasing specific capacity and rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials have shown extraordinary promise for green and sustainable electrochemical energy storage devices, but usually suffer from low specific capacity and poor rate capability, which is largely caused by inactive components and diffusion&#8208;controlled Li+ intercalation. Herein, high&#8208;rate Li+ intercalation pseudocapacitance in organic molecular crystals is achieved through introducing weak secondary bonding channels, far exceeding their theoretical capacity based on redox chemistry at functional groups. The authors&#8217; combined experimentally electrochemical characterization with first&#8208;principles calculations show that the heterocyclic organic molecule 2,2&#8242;&#8208;bipyridine&#8208;4,4&#8242;&#8208;dicarboxylic acid (BPDCA) crystal permits a four&#8208;electron redox reaction at conventional &#63743;C&#63742;O and &#63743;C&#63742;N groups and a six&#8208;electron intercalation pseudocapacitance along conjugated alkene hydrogen bonding channels (&#63743;H2NC5&#63743;H&#8943;O&#63742;C(OH)&#63743;) and heterocyclic aromatic stacking channels (&#63743;C5H3N&#8943;NH3C5&#63743;). The BPDCA electrode delivers an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 1206&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8208;1 and an exceptional rate capability. A 4.8&#160;V high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density BPDCA anode&#8208;based hybrid Li&#8208;ion capacitor is thus realized. This work opens a new avenue for developing organic intercalation pseudocapacitive materials via secondary bonding structure design.

         <title>Room Temperature Ferromagnetism of Monolayer Chromium Telluride with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the room temperature ferromagnetism of monolayer Cr3Te4 is reported which is not an inherently layered material. Molecular beam epitaxy allows the successful growth of 2D Cr3Te4 in the monolayer form on graphite at low substrate temperatures, e.g., &#8776;100 &#176;C, which is compatible with Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology.








Abstract
The realization of long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in 2D systems can potentially revolutionize next&#8208;generation information technology. Here, the successful fabrication of crystalline Cr3Te4 monolayers with room temperature (RT) ferromagnetism is reported. Using molecular beam epitaxy, the growth of 2D Cr3Te4 films with monolayer thickness is demonstrated at low substrate temperatures (&#8776;100 &#176;C), compatible with Si complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism measurements reveal a Curie temperature (Tc) of v344 K for the Cr3Te4 monolayer with an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic easy axis, which decreases to v240 K for the thicker film (&#8776;7&#160;nm) with an in&#8208;plane easy axis. The enhancement of ferromagnetic coupling and the magnetic anisotropy transition is ascribed to interfacial effects, in particular the orbital overlap at the monolayer Cr3Te4/graphite interface, supported by density&#8208;functional theory calculations. This work sheds light on the low&#8208;temperature scalable growth of 2D nonlayered materials with RT ferromagnetism for new magnetic and spintronic devices.

         <title>Randomly Induced Phase Transformation in Silk Protein&#8208;Based Microlaser Arrays for Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel physically unclonable cryptographic protocol from silk protein&#8208;based microlaser arrays is proposed, where the randomness was&#160;introduced through randomly induced phase transformation of silk protein. The microlaser array possesses the deterministic readout sites of laser signals and unrepeatable signal distribution characteristics, which can guarantee efficient authentication and high security when serving as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label.








Abstract
Anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) exhibit high security with unreplicable code outputs, making them an ideal platform to realize unbreakable anticounterfeiting. Although various schemes are proposed for PUF labels, the utilization of natural randomness suffers from unpredictable signal extraction sites, which poses a challenge to efficient and convenient authentication for practical anticounterfeiting applications. Here, a covert optical PUF&#8208;based cryptographic protocol from silk protein&#8208;based microlaser (SML) arrays that possess hidden randomness of lasers for unclonable lasing signals as well as a defined location for efficient identification is proposed. The initial SMLs are patterned by casting laser dye&#8208;doped regenerated silk fibroin solution, resulting in a uniform microlaser array with regulated positions. With the SML array as substrate, random methanol microdroplets are stochastically sprayed on the SML array, which eventually induces uneven lasing signal changes of the patterned microlasers. The treated SML array possesses the deterministic readout sites of laser signals and unrepeatable signal distribution characteristics, which can guarantee efficient authentication and high security when serving as an anticounterfeiting label.

         <title>The Role of Additives in Suppressing the Degradation of Liquid&#8208;Exfoliated WS2 Monolayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of liquid&#8208;exfoliated WS2 monolayers is studied in situ through photoluminescence as function of time and temperature in two surfactant systems (sodium cholate&#8212;SC; sodium dodecyl sulfate&#8212;SDS). The kinetics reveal that a photoinduced degradation (activation energy &#8776;25 kJ mol&#8722;1) is dominant in SC, while an additional thermal degradation (activation energy &#8776;50 kJ mol&#8722;1) is observed in SDS.








Abstract
Group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be chemically widely inert, but recent reports point toward an oxidation of monolayered sheets in ambient conditions, due to defects. To date, the degradation of monolayered TMDs is only studied on individual, substrate&#8208;supported nanosheets with varying defect type and concentration, strain, and in an inhomogeneous environment. Here, degradation kinetics of WS2 nanosheet ensembles in the liquid phase are investigated through photoluminescence measurements, which selectively probe the monolayers. Monolayer&#8208;enriched WS2 dispersions are produced with varying lateral sizes in the two common surfactant stabilizers sodium cholate (SC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Well&#8208;defined degradation kinetics are observed, which enable the determination of activation energies of the degradation and decouple photoinduced and thermal degradation. The thermal degradation is slower than the photoinduced degradation and requires higher activation energy. Using SC as surfactant, it is sufficiently suppressed. The photoinduced degradation can be widely prevented through chemical passivation achieved through the addition of cysteine which, on the one hand, coordinates to defects on the nanosheets and, on the other hand, stabilizes oxides on the surface, which shield the nanosheets from further degradation.

&lt;p&gt;The degradation of liquid-exfoliated WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers is studied in situ through photoluminescence as function of time and temperature in two surfactant systems (sodium cholate&#8212;SC; sodium dodecyl sulfate&#8212;SDS). The kinetics reveal that a photoinduced degradation (activation energy &#8776;25 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is dominant in SC, while an additional thermal degradation (activation energy &#8776;50 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is observed in SDS.

         <title>Charge Density Wave Orders and Enhanced Superconductivity under Pressure in the Kagome Metal CsV3Sb5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4a&#160;&#215; 1a and 2a&#160;&#215; 2a charge density wave (CDW) orders are observed in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5 single crystal. A dome&#8208;shaped phase diagram accompanying the suppression of CDW state reveals a complex landscape of electronic states that can co&#8208;exist on a kagome lattice and compete with superconductivity, offering a new platform to investigate the interplay between superconductivity, CDW, and nontrivial topological electronic structure.








Abstract
Superconductivity in topological kagome metals has recently received great research interests. Here, charge density wave (CDW) orders and the evolution of superconductivity under various pressures in CsV3Sb5 single crystal with V kagome lattice are investigated. By using high&#8208;resolution scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), two CDW orders in CsV3Sb5 are observed which correspond to 4a&#160;&#215; 1a and 2a&#160;&#215; 2a superlattices. By applying pressure, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is significantly enhanced and reaches a maximum value of 8.2 K at around 1&#160;GPa. Accordingly, CDW state is gradually declined as increasing the pressure, which indicates the competing interplay between CDW and superconducting state in this material. The broad superconducting transitions around 0.4&#8211;0.8&#160;GPa can be related to the strong competition relation among two CDW states and superconductivity. These results demonstrate that CsV3Sb5 is a new platform for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and CDW in topological kagome metals.

         <title>A Highly Robust Ionotronic Fiber with Unprecedented Mechanomodulation of Ionic Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stretchable and robust ionotronic fiber comprising liquid crystal elastomer network and ionic liquid is reported. The soft chain spacers selectively anchor cations while rigid mesogens align in response to stretch leading to the formation of phase&#8208;separated low&#8208;tortuous anion&#8208;conducting nanochannels. Consequently, the ionic conductivity is unprecedentedly boosted with strain, which has never been observed in previously reported ionic conductors.








Abstract
Stretchable ionic conductors are appealing for tissue&#8208;like soft electronics, yet suffer from a tardy mechanoelectric response due to their poor modulation of ionic conduction arising from intrinsic homogeneous soft chain network. Here, a highly robust ionotronic fiber is designed by synergizing ionic liquid and liquid crystal elastomer with alternate rigid mesogen units and soft chain spacers, which shows an unprecedented strain&#8208;induced ionic conductivity boost (&#8776;103 times enhanced as stretched to 2000% strain). Such a surprisingly high enhancement is attributed to the formation of microphase&#8208;separated low&#8208;tortuosity ion&#8208;conducting nanochannels guided by strain&#8208;induced emergence of aligned smectic mesophases, thus allowing for ultrafast ion transport that resembles the role of &#8220;swimming lanes.&#8221; Intriguingly, the boosting conductivity even reverses Pouillet's Law&#8208;dictated resistance increase at certain strains, leading to unique waveform&#8208;discernible strain sensing. Moreover, the fiber retains thermal actuation properties with a maximum of 70% strain changes upon heating, and enables integrated self&#8208;perception and actuation. The findings offer a promising molecular engineering route to mechanically modulate the ion transport behavior of ionic conductors toward advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Energy Storage Performance of Layered Polymer Nanocomposites over a Broad Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;structured polymer nanocomposites exhibit remarkable capacitive energy storage performance, including high energy density, great charge&#8211;discharge efficiency, low driving field, and excellent dielectric stability at high electric fields and elevated temperatures. This work enables the rational design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density dielectric polymer composites with a wide working temperature range.








Abstract
To reach the full potential of polymer dielectrics in advanced electronics and electrified transportation, it calls for efficient operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density dielectric polymers under high voltages over a wide temperature range. Here, the polymer composites consisting of the boron nitride nanosheet/polyetherimide and TiO2 nanorod arrays/polyetherimide layers are reported. The layered composite exhibits a much higher dielectric constant than the current high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers and composites, while simultaneously retaining low dielectric loss at elevated temperatures and high applied fields. Consequently, the layered polymer composite presents much improved capacitive performance than the current dielectric polymers and composites over a temperature range of 25&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the excellent capacitive performance of the layered composite is achieved at an applied field that is about 40% lower than the typical field strength of the current polymer composites with the discharged energy densities of &gt;3 J cm&#8722;3 at 150&#160;&#176;C. Remarkable cyclability and dielectric stability are established in the layered polymer nanocomposites. This work addresses the current challenge in the enhancement of the energy densities of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers and demonstrates an efficient route to dielectric polymeric materials with high energy densities and low loss over a broad temperature range.

         <title>Anchoring Sites Engineering in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Energy Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with isolated metal atoms stabilized on various supports by surrounding atoms have emerged as a new frontier. The atomic structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs. This review provides an overview of the correlation between the property of anchoring points and catalytic performance to guide the designing of the SACs.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have been at the frontier of research field in catalysis owing to the maximized atomic utilization, unique structures and properties. The atomically dispersed and catalytically active metal atoms are necessarily anchored by surrounding atoms. As such, the structure and composition of anchoring sites significantly influence the catalytic performance of SACs even with the same metal element. Significant progress has been made to understand structure&#8211;activity relationships at an atomic level, but in&#8208;depth understanding in precisely designing highly efficient SACs for the targeted reactions is still required. In this review, various anchoring sites in SACs are summarized and classified into five different types (doped heteroatoms, defect sites, surface atoms, metal sites, and cavity sites). Then, their impacts on catalytic performance are elucidated for electrochemical reactions based on their distance from the metal center (first coordination shell and beyond). Further, SACs anchored on two typical types of hosts, carbon&#8208; and metal&#8208;based materials, are highlighted, and the effects of anchoring points on achieving the desirable atomic structure, catalytic performance, and reaction pathways are elaborated. At last, insights and outlook to the SAC field based on current achievements and challenges are presented.

         <title>Tethering Cells via Enzymatic Oxidative Crosslinking Enables Mechanotransduction in Non&#8208;Cell&#8208;Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cells need to sense their environment in order to survive and function. In this study an enzymatic crosslinking strategy that can tether non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive materials to cells is presented. By targeting the cellular adhesome, this cell&#8211;material tethering method enables cell&#8208;volume&#8208;independent lineage programming of stem cells in engineered 3D microniches with controlled stiffness.








Abstract
Cell&#8211;matrix interactions govern cell behavior and tissue function by facilitating transduction of biomechanical cues. Engineered tissues often incorporate these interactions by employing cell&#8208;adhesive materials. However, using constitutively active cell&#8208;adhesive materials impedes control over cell fate and elicits inflammatory responses upon implantation. Here, an alternative cell&#8211;material interaction strategy that provides mechanotransducive properties via discrete inducible on&#8208;cell crosslinking (DOCKING) of materials, including those that are inherently non&#8208;cell&#8208;adhesive, is introduced. Specifically, tyramine&#8208;functionalized materials are tethered to tyrosines that are naturally present in extracellular protein domains via enzyme&#8208;mediated oxidative crosslinking. Temporal control over the stiffness of on&#8208;cell tethered 3D microniches reveals that DOCKING uniquely enables lineage programming of stem cells by targeting adhesome&#8208;related mechanotransduction pathways acting independently of cell volume changes and spreading. In short, DOCKING represents a bioinspired and cytocompatible cell&#8208;tethering strategy that offers new routes to study and engineer cell&#8211;material interactions, thereby advancing applications ranging from drug delivery, to cell&#8208;based therapy, and cultured meat.

         <title>A General Crosslinker Strategy to Realize Intrinsic Frozen Resistance of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and universal crosslinking strategy to fabricate a family of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked materials with intrinsic, built&#8208;in antifreezing and mechanical properties, but without any antifreezing additives is demonstrated. The resultant EGINA&#8208;crosslinked materials, consisting of a wide range of compositions (hydrophilies, electrolytes, zwitterions, macromolecules), enable to achieve their antifreezing properties at &#8722;20 &#176;C in solution, gel state, and hydrogel/solid interfaces.








Abstract
Development and understanding of antifreezing materials are fundamentally and practically important for materials design and delivery. However, almost all of antifreezing materials are either organic/icephobic materials containing no water or hydrophilic hydrogels containing antifreezing additives. Here, a general crosslinking strategy to fabricate a family of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked double&#8208;network hydrogels with intrinsic, built&#8208;in antifreezing and mechanical properties, but without any antifreezing additives is proposed and demonstrated. The resultant hydrogels, despite large structural and compositional variations of hydrophilies, electrolytes, zwitterions, and macromolecules of polymer chains, achieved strong antifreezing and mechanical properties in different environments including solution state, gel state, and hydrogel/solid interfaces. Such general antifreezing property of EGINA&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, regardless network compositions, is likely stemmed from their highly hydrophilic and tightly crosslinked DN structures for inducing strong water&#8211;network bindings to prevent ice crystal formation from free waters in hydrogel networks. EGINA&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels can also serve as a key component to be fabricated into smart windows with high optical transmittance and supercapacitors with excellent electrochemical stability at subzero temperatures. This work provides a simple, blueprint antifreezing design concept and a family of antifreezing hydrogels for the better understanding of the composite&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship of antifreezing materials and the fundamentals of confined water in wet soft materials.

         <title>Switchable Photonic Bio&#8208;Adhesive Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft photonic bio&#8208;adhesive demonstrates large reversible changes in adhesion power and mechanical strength with concurrent self&#8208;reporting colorimetric responses. This coupled behavior is derived by the humidity&#8208;driven intercalation/removal of water molecules into a glucose&#8208;containing hydrogen&#8208;bonded polymer network within a liquid crystal polysaccharide matrix that triggers tightly correlated changes in mechanical strength, adhesion, and pitch length of the chiral nematic organization.








Abstract
A soft photonic bio&#8208;adhesive material is designed with real&#8208;time colorimetrical monitoring of switchable adhesion by integrating a responsive bio&#8208;photonic matrix with mobile hydrogen&#8208;binding networking. Synergetic materials sequencing creates a unique iridescent appearance directly coupled with both adhesive ability and shearing strength, in a highly reversible manner. The responsive photonic materials, having a physically hydrogen&#8208;bonded chiral nematic organization, vary their adhesion strength due to a transition in cohesive and interfacial failure mechanism in humid surroundings. The bright color appearance shifts from blue to red to transparent and back due to a change in pitch length of the chiral helicoidal organization that also triggers coupled changes in both mechanical strength and interfacial adhesion. Such reversible strength&#8208;adhesion&#8208;iridescence triple&#8208;coupling phenomenon is further explored for design of super&#8208;strong switchable bio&#8208;adhesives for synthetic/biological surfaces with quick remotely triggered sticky&#8208;to&#8208;nonsticky transitions, removable conformal soft stickers, and wound dressings with visual monitoring of the healing process, to colorimetric stickers for contaminated respiratory masks.

         <title>Fully Bottom&#8208;Up Waste&#8208;Free Growth of Ultrathin Silicon Wafer via Self&#8208;Releasing Seed Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a fully bottom&#8208;up technique for fabricating a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate, whereas conventional technologies waste large amounts of such material. Plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxially grown silicon seed layer with self&#8208;organized nanogap is a key for realization of the fully bottom&#8208;up process. The results represent a technological breakthrough in advanced silicon microelectronics and photovoltaics.








Abstract
The fabrication of ultrathin silicon wafers at low cost is crucial for advancing silicon electronics toward stretchability and flexibility. However, conventional fabrication techniques are inefficient because they sacrifice a large amount of substrate material. Thus, advanced silicon electronics that have been realized in laboratories cannot move forward to commercialization. Here, a fully bottom&#8208;up technique for producing a self&#8208;releasing ultrathin silicon wafer without sacrificing any of the substrate is presented. The key to this approach is a self&#8208;organized nanogap on the substrate fabricated by plasma&#8208;assisted epitaxial growth (plasma&#8208;epi) and subsequent hydrogen annealing. The wafer thickness can be independently controlled during the bulk growth after the formation of plasma&#8208;epi seed layer. In addition, semiconductor devices are realized using the ultrathin silicon wafer. Given the high scalability of plasma&#8208;epi and its compatibility with conventional semiconductor process, the proposed bottom&#8208;up wafer fabrication process will open a new route to developing advanced silicon electronics.

         <title>Quantifying Contact&#8208;Electrification Induced Charge Transfer on a Liquid Droplet after Contacting with a Liquid or Solid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An apparatus based on acoustic levitation is designed to measure the charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid and liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, and the asymmetric transfer behavior of positive and negative charges at the oil&#8211;water interface is observed, suggesting that the electron transfer plays a dominant role in the contact electrification at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces.








Abstract
Contact electrification (CE) is a common physical phenomenon, and its mechanisms for solid&#8211;solid and liquid&#8211;solid cases have been widely discussed. However, the studies about liquid&#8211;liquid CE are hindered by the lack of proper techniques. Here, a contactless method is proposed for quantifying the charges on a liquid droplet based on the combination of electric field and acoustic field. The liquid droplet is suspended in an acoustic field, and an electric field force is created on the droplet to balance the acoustic trap force. The amount of charges on the droplet is thus calculated based on the equilibrium of forces. Further, the liquid&#8211;solid and liquid&#8211;liquid CE are both studied by using the method, and the latter is focused. The behavior of negatively precharged liquid droplet in the liquid&#8211;liquid CE is found to be different from that of the positively precharged one. The results show that the silicone oil droplet prefers to receive negative charges from a negatively charged aqueous droplet rather than positive charges from a positively charged aqueous droplet, which provides a strong evidence about the dominant role played by electron transfer in the liquid&#8211;liquid CE.

         <title>Substantial P&#8208;Type Conductivity of AlN Achieved via Beryllium Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal modulated epitaxy (MME) grown Be&#8208;doped AlN shows substantial first&#8208;time experimental p&#8208;type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 1015&#8211;3.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at room temperature. The acceptor activation energy is found to be &#8776;37 meV, &#8776;8 times lower than predicted in literature but on par with MME p&#8208;type GaN. A p&#8208;AlN:Be/i&#8208;GaN:Be/n&#8208;GaN:Ge diode is demonstrated with substantial rectification.








Abstract
Beryllium has long been predicted by first principle theory as the best p&#8208;type dopant for GaN and AlN. But experimental validation of these theories has not, until now, borne out the original predictions. A key challenge is the dopant&#8208;induced strain leading to Be rejection from substitutional sites in favor of interstitial sites, leading to self&#8208;compensation. More flexible growth methods like metal modulated epitaxy (MME) that can operate at substantially lower temperatures than traditional approaches, can more effectively place Be into the proper substitutional lattice sites. MME grown Be&#8208;doped AlN shows substantial p&#8208;type conductivity with hole concentrations in the range of 2.3 &#215; 1015&#8211;3.1 &#215; 1018&#160;cm&#8722;3&#160;at room temperature. While others have achieved sizable carrier concentrations near surfaces via carbon doping or Si implantation, this is the only known demonstration of substantial bulk p&#8208;type doping in AlN and is a nearly 1000 times higher carrier concentration than the best previously demonstrated bulk electron concentrations in AlN. The acceptor activation energy is found to be &#8776;37 meV, &#8776;8 times lower than predicted in literature but on par with similar results for MME p&#8208;type GaN. Preliminary results suggest that the films are highly compensated. A p&#8208;AlN:Be/i&#8208;GaN:Be/n&#8208;GaN:Ge pin diode is demonstrated with substantial rectification.

         <title>Shedding Light on the Role of Chemical Bond in Catalysis of Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent developments of catalytic nitrogen fixation, digs deep into the atomic&#8208;scale insight of the reaction mechanism to clarify the ambiguity, lists powerful methods for enhancing the nitrogen fixation performance, and combines theory predictions with experimental results, all from a chemical bond perspective, which could facilitate deeper pondering and further exploration in the nitrogen fixation field.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) and nitrates are essential for human society because of their widespread utilization for producing medicines, fibers, fertilizers, etc. In recent years, the development on nitrogen fixation under mild reaction conditions has attracted much attention. However, the very low conversion efficiency and ambiguous catalytic mechanism remain the major hurdles for the research of nitrogen fixation. This review aims to clarify the role of chemical bond in catalytic nitrogen fixation by summarizing and analyzing the recent development of nitrogen fixation research. In detail, the atomic&#8208;scale mechanism of nitrogen fixation reaction, the various methods to improve the nitrogen fixation performance, and the computational investigation of nitrogen fixation are discussed, all from a chemical bond perspective. It is hoped that this review could trigger more profound pondering and deeper exploration in the field of catalytic nitrogen fixation.

         <title>Entropy Landscaping of High&#8208;Entropy Carbides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy carbides are designed based on valence electron concentration (VEC). VEC describes entropy, enthalpy, free energy, volume, and metastability of high entropy carbides such that a new composition thermodynamic property can be explained based on VEC.








Abstract
The entropy landscape of high&#8208;entropy carbides can be used to understand and predict their structure, properties, and stability. Using first principles calculations, the individual and temperature&#8208;dependent contributions of vibrational, electronic, and configurational entropies are analyzed, and compare them qualitatively to the enthalpies of mixing. As an experimental complement, high&#8208;entropy carbide thin films are synthesized with high power impulse magnetron sputtering to assess structure and properties. All compositions can be stabilized in the single&#8208;phase state despite finite positive, and in some cases substantial, enthalpies of mixing. Density functional theory calculations reveal that configurational entropy dominates the free energy landscape and compensates for the enthalpic penalty, whereas the vibrational and electronic entropies offer negligible contributions. The calculations predict that in many compositions, the single&#8208;phase state becomes stable at extremely high temperatures (&gt;3000 K). Consequently, rapid quenching rates are needed to preserve solubility at room temperature and facilitate physical characterization. Physical vapor deposition provides this experimental validation opportunity. The computation/experimental data set generated in this work identifies &#8220;valence electron concentration&#8221; as an effective descriptor to predict structural and thermodynamic properties of multicomponent carbides and educate new formulation selections.

         <title>A &#8220;Bridge&#8208;Building&#8221; Glycan Scaffold Mimicking Microbial Invasion for In Situ Endothelialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glycan substrate (GMDE) can preferentially support endothelial cells (ECs) adhesion by binding galectin&#8208;1, a carbohydrate&#8208;binding protein highly secreted by ECs, which in turn connects the substrate with the integrin receptors of the ECs. Implantation of GMDE promotes blood vessel formation in a murine ischemic model, suggesting its potential for future vascular therapy.








Abstract
The globally high prevalence of peripheral artery diseases poses a pressing need for biomaterials grafts to rebuild vasculature. When implanted, they should promote endothelial cells (ECs) adhesion both profoundly and selectively&#8212;but the latter expectation remains unfulfilled. Here, this work is inspired by fungi that invade blood vessels via the &#8220;bridge&#8221; of galectins that, secreted by ECs, can simultaneously bind carbohydrates on fungal surface and integrin receptors on ECs. A glucomannan decanoate (GMDE) substrate mimicking fungal carbohydrates that highly and preferentially supports ECs adhesion while rejecting several other cell types is designed. Electrospun GMDE scaffolds efficiently sequester endogenous galectin&#8208;1&#8212;which bridges ECs to the scaffolds as it functions in fungal invasions&#8212;and promote blood perfusion in a murine limb ischemic model. Meanwhile, the application of GMDE requires no exogenous pro&#8208;angiogenic agents and causes no organ toxicity or adverse inflammation in mice, highlighting its high safety of potential translation. This glycan material, uniquely mimicking a microbial action and harnessing a secreted protein as a &#8220;bridge,&#8221; represents an effective, safe, and different strategy for ischemic vascular therapy.

         <title>Unconstrained 3D Shape Programming with Light&#8208;Induced Stress Gradient</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through introducing light responsive diselenide bonds into polymer films, homogeneous stress fixed by shape&#8208;memory effect could be relaxed to form a stress gradient. Once the stress gradient is activated, various deformations, including bending, folding, twisting, and helix, could be realized through the asymmetric contraction, which could be further combined for 3D shape programming, sequential deformation, and microscopic optical patterning.








Abstract
Programming 2D sheets to form 3D shapes is significant for flexible electronics, soft robots, and biomedical devices. Stress regulation is one of the most used methods, during which external force is usually needed to keep the stress, leading to complex processing setups. Here, by introducing dynamic diselenide bonds into shape&#8208;memory materials, unconstrained shape programming with light is achieved. The material could hold and release internal stress by themselves through the shape&#8208;memory effect, simplifying programming setups. The fixed stress could be relaxed by light to form stress gradients, leading to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations through asymmetric contractions. Benefiting from the variability of light irradiation, complex 3D configurations can be obtained conveniently from 2D polymer sheets. Besides, remotely controlled &#8220;4D assembly&#8221; and actuation, including object transportation and self&#8208;lifting, can be achieved by sequential deformation. Taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of light, this material can also produce 3D microscopic patterns. The light&#8208;induced stress gradients significantly simplify 3D shape programming procedures with improved resolution and complexity and have great potential in soft robots, smart actuators, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting techniques.

         <title>Controlling Liquid Crystal Orientations for Programmable Anisotropic Transformations in Cellular Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user&#8208;defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independtly at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breakings, which can be exploited to achieve switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties as well as to modulate light.








Abstract
Geometric reconfigurations in cellular structures have recently been exploited to realize adaptive materials with applications in mechanics, optics, and electronics. However, the achievable symmetry breakings and corresponding types of deformation and related functionalities have remained rather limited, mostly due to the fact that the macroscopic geometry of the structures is generally co&#8208;aligned with the molecular anisotropy of the constituent material. To address this limitation, cellular microstructures are fabricated out of liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with an arbitrary, user&#8208;defined liquid crystal (LC) mesogen orientation encrypted by a weak magnetic field. This platform enables anisotropy to be programmed independently at the molecular and structural levels and the realization of unprecedented director&#8208;determined symmetry breakings in cellular materials, which are demonstrated by both finite element analyses and experiments. It is illustrated that the resulting mechanical reconfigurations can be harnessed to program microcellular materials with switchable and direction&#8208;dependent frictional properties and further exploit &#8221;area&#8208;specific&#8221; deformation patterns to locally modulate transmitted light and precisely guide object movement. As such, the work provides a clear route to decouple anisotropy at the materials level from the directionality of the macroscopic cellular structure, which may lead to a new generation of smart and adaptive materials and&#160;devices.

         <title>Ferromagnetic&#8211;Antiferromagnetic Coupling Core&#8211;Shell Nanoparticles with Spin Conservation for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Core&#8211;shell Fe3O4@Ni(OH)2 catalysts with different core sizes and shell thicknesses that mimic surface&#8208;reconstructed catalysts, are made to investigate the effect of magnetic domain structure on magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;improved oxygen evolution activity. Only the catalyst with a multiple domain core and a relatively thin shell exhibits a significant enhancement under the external magnetic field.








Abstract
Rational design of active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts is critical for the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. The differing spin states of the OER reactants and products is one of the factors that slows OER kinetics. Thus, spin conservation plays a crucial role in enhancing OER performance. In this work, ferromagnetic (FM)&#8211;antiferromagnetic (AFM) Fe3O4@Ni(OH)2 core&#8211;shell catalysts are designed. The interfacial FM&#8211;AFM coupling of these catalysts facilitates selective removal of electrons with spin direction opposing the magnetic moment of FM core, improving OER kinetics. The shell thickness is found critical in retaining the coupling effect for OER enhancement. The magnetic domain structure of the FM core also plays a critical role. With a multiple domain core, the applied magnetic field aligns the magnetic domains, optimizing the electron transport process. A significant enhancement of OER activity is observed for the multiple domain core catalysts. With a single&#8208;domain FM core with ordered magnetic dipoles, the spin&#8208;selective electron transport with minimal scattering is facilitated even without an applied magnetic field. A magnetism/OER activity model therefore hypothesizes that depends on two main parameters: interfacial spin coupling and domain structure. These findings provide new design principles for active OER catalysts.

         <title>First&#8208;Principles Multiscale Modeling of Mechanical Properties in Graphene/Borophene Heterostructures Empowered by Machine&#8208;Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties based on machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials conveniently trainable over short ab initio datasets is proposed. It is shown that mechanical/failure responses of complex nanostructures at continuum scale and high temperatures can be explored with the precision of sophisticated first&#8208;principles calculations, affordable computational cost, and without the need for empirical data.








Abstract
Density functional theory calculations are robust tools to explore the mechanical properties of pristine structures at their ground state but become exceedingly expensive for large systems at finite temperatures. Classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations offer the possibility to study larger systems at elevated temperatures, but they require accurate interatomic potentials. Herein the authors propose the concept of first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling of mechanical properties, where ab initio level of accuracy is hierarchically bridged to explore the mechanical/failure response of macroscopic systems. It is demonstrated that machine&#8208;learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) fitted to ab initio datasets play a pivotal role in achieving this goal. To practically illustrate this novel possibility, the mechanical/failure response of graphene/borophene coplanar heterostructures is examined. It is shown that MLIPs conveniently outperform popular CMD models for graphene and borophene and they can evaluate the mechanical properties of pristine and heterostructure phases at room temperature. Based on the information provided by the MLIP&#8208;based CMD, continuum models of heterostructures using the finite element method can be constructed. The study highlights that MLIPs were&#160;the missing block for conducting first&#8208;principles multiscale modeling, and their employment empowers a straightforward route to bridge ab initio level accuracy and flexibility to explore the mechanical/failure response of nanostructures at continuum scale.

         <title>2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite with Ordered Phase Distribution for High&#8208;Performance Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered photodetector based on a 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite with an ordered phase distribution is presented. The increased built&#8208;in potential due to the gradient phase distribution, oriented crystals, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of the device in the entire response spectrum range.








Abstract
2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites exhibit great potential in optoelectronic devices for superior stability compared with their 3D counterparts. However, to achieve a high level of device performance, it is crucial but challenging to regulate the phase distribution of 2D perovskites to facilitate charge carrier transfer. Herein, using a solvent additive method (adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF)) combined with a hot&#8208;casting process, the phase distribution of (PEA)2MA3Pb4I13 (PEA+&#160;= C6H5CH2CH2NH3+, MA+&#160;= CH3NH3+) perovskite can be well controlled and the Fermi level of perovskites along the film thickness direction can achieve gradient distribution. The increased built&#8208;in potential, oriented crystal, and improved crystal quality jointly contribute to the high photoresponse of devices in the entire response spectrum range. The optimum device exhibits a characteristic detection peak at 570&#160;nm with large responsivity/detectivity (0.44 A W&#8722;1/3.38 &#215; 1012 Jones), ultrafast response speed with a rise/fall time of 20.8/20.6 &#181;s, and improved stability. This work suggests the possibility of manipulating the ordered phase distribution of 2D perovskites toward high&#8208;performance and stable optoelectronic conversion devices.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Multicolor Image Sensor Based on Electrochromic Color&#8208;Radix Demultiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of a broadband color&#8208;tunable photodetector and its high&#8208;accuracy digital color&#8208;discrimination scheme is presented. Vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors demonstrates a superior capability of regulating charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths, yielding voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. An array of optoelectronic logic sensors that can demultiplex color coordinates with high color accuracy is demonstrated.








Abstract
Optical data acquisition has been set as one of the milestones to testify the developments aimed at harnessing the full potential of the spatial and temporal data processing capabilities of the advanced semiconductor technology. A highly promising approach to drive the level of acquisition beyond the current technological node is the vertical integration of multiple photodetectors. However, vertical integration so far requires the same level of circuit complexity as lateral integration from the incapability of monolithic integration. Here, an electrochromic device architecture is introduced that enables realization of a monolithic tandem multicolor photodetector. The device, composed of vertically stacked p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type graphene barristors, is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the balanced charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths. It exhibits variable anti&#8208;ambipolar charge transport behavior, which yields sensitive voltage&#8208;controlled photoconductive gain spectra. These electrical behaviors are utilized to fabricate an optoelectronic logic sensor that can demultiplex the desired color coordinate or wavelength in the constituent array with high color accuracy.

&lt;p&gt;A new design of a broadband color-tunable photodetector and its high-accuracy digital color-discrimination scheme is presented. Vertically stacked p-type and n-type graphene barristors demonstrates a superior capability of regulating charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths, yielding voltage-controlled photoconductive gain spectra. An array of optoelectronic logic sensors that can demultiplex color coordinates with high color accuracy is demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optical data acquisition has been set as one of the milestones to testify the developments aimed at harnessing the full potential of the spatial and temporal data processing capabilities of the advanced semiconductor technology. A highly promising approach to drive the level of acquisition beyond the current technological node is the vertical integration of multiple photodetectors. However, vertical integration so far requires the same level of circuit complexity as lateral integration from the incapability of monolithic integration. Here, an electrochromic device architecture is introduced that enables realization of a monolithic tandem multicolor photodetector. The device, composed of vertically stacked p-type and n-type graphene barristors, is demonstrated to be capable of regulating the balanced charge transport under any desired illumination wavelengths. It exhibits variable anti-ambipolar charge transport behavior, which yields sensitive voltage-controlled photoconductive gain spectra. These electrical behaviors are utilized to fabricate an optoelectronic logic sensor that can demultiplex the desired color coordinate or wavelength in the constituent array with high color accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>New Insights into the High&#8208;Performance Black Phosphorus Anode for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A well&#8208;designed black phosphorus&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotube composite (BP/G/CNTs) shows stable high&#8208;current cycling performance at 2 A g&#8722;1. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy study of this material reveals the precise reaction mechanism of BP and Li+ during cycling.








Abstract
Black phosphorus (BP) is a promising anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) owing to its high electrical conductivity and capacity. However, the huge volume change of BP during cycling induces rapid capacity fading. In addition, the unclear electrochemical mechanism of BP hinders the development of rational designs and preparation of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based anodes. Here, a high&#8208;performance nanostructured BP&#8211;graphite&#8211;carbon nanotubes composite (BP/G/CNTs) synthesized using ball&#8208;milling method is reported. The BP/G/CNTs anode delivers a high initial capacity of 1375&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.15 A g&#8722;1 and maintains 1031.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 450 cycles. Excellent high&#8208;rate performance is demonstrated with a capacity of 508.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, for the first time, direct evidence is provided experimentally to present the electrochemical mechanism of BP anodes with three&#8208;step lithiation and delithiation using ex situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), ex situ X&#8208;ray emission spectroscopy, operando XRD, and operando XAS, which reveal the formation of Li3P7, LiP, and Li3P. Furthermore, the study indicates an open&#8208;circuit relaxation effect of the electrode with ex situ and operando XAS analyses.

         <title>Highly Permeable DNA Supramolecular Hydrogel Promotes Neurogenesis and Functional Recovery after Completely Transected Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA supramolecular hydrogel carrying neural stem cells (NSCs) is applied to repair spinal cord injury. A renascent neural network is formed at the lesion site via the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs. Due to the newly formed synapses at the lesion area, rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials.








Abstract
Regeneration after severe spinal cord injury cannot occur naturally in mammals. Transplanting stem cells to the injury site is a highly promising method, but it faces many challenges because it relies heavily on the microenvironment provided by both the lesion site and delivery material. Although mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability of delivery materials have been extensively explored, their permeability has rarely been recognized. Here, a DNA hydrogel is designed with extremely high permeability to repair a 2 mm spinal cord gap in Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats. The rats recover basic hindlimb function with detectable motor&#8208;evoked potentials, and a renascent neural network is formed via the proliferation and differentiation of both implanted and endogenous stem cells. The signal at the lesion area is conveyed by, on average, 15 newly formed synapses. This hydrogel system offers great potential in clinical trials. Further, it should be easily adaptable to other tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Surface Diffusion and Epitaxial Self&#8208;Planarization for Wafer&#8208;Scale Single&#8208;Grain Metal Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single&#8208;grain 2D metal chalcogenides remains a challenge in the commercialization of various electronic devices based on these materials. A generalized surface&#8208;diffusion&#8208;induced epitaxial self&#8208;planarization method to produce wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenide thin films is described. This process also enables the practical applications of single&#8208;grain metal chalcogenides without involving a transfer process.








Abstract
Although wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain thin films of 2D metal chalcogenides (MCs) have been extensively sought after during the last decade, the grain size of the MC thin films is still limited in the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. A general strategy of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;grain MC thin films by using commercial wafers (Si, Ge, GaAs) both as metal source and epitaxial collimator is presented. A new mechanism of single&#8208;grain thin&#8208;film formation, surface diffusion, and epitaxial self&#8208;planarization is proposed, where chalcogen elements migrate preferentially along substrate surface and the epitaxial crystal domains flow to form an atomically smooth thin film. Through synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, the formation of single&#8208;grain Si2Te3, GeTe, GeSe, and GaTe thin films on (111) Si, Ge, and (100) GaAs is verified. The Si2Te3 thin film is used to achieve transfer&#8208;free fabrication of a high&#8208;performance bipolar memristive electrical&#8208;switching device.

         <title>A Nearly Packaging&#8208;Free Design Paradigm for Light, Powerful, and Energy&#8208;Dense Primary Microbatteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Billions of internet&#8208;connected devices require microbattery power sources, but their operating times are severely limited by the poor scaling of battery energy density. This work presents a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the majority of packaging and using thick and dense electrodes with controlled crystal orientation for fast transport.








Abstract
Billions of internet connected devices used for medicine, wearables, and robotics require microbattery power sources, but the conflicting scaling laws between electronics and energy storage have led to inadequate power sources that severely limit the performance of these physically small devices. Reported here is a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density by eliminating the vast majority of the packaging and through the use of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode and cathode materials. These light (50&#8211;80&#160;mg) and small (20&#8211;40&#160;&#181;L) microbatteries are enabled though the electroplating of 130&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick 94% dense additive&#8208;free and crystallographically oriented LiCoO2 onto thin metal foils, which also act as the encapsulation layer. These devices have 430&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 1050&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 energy densities, 4 times the energy density of previous similarly sized microbatteries, opening up the potential to power otherwise unpowerable microdevices.

         <title>A Smartphone&#8208;Enabled Portable Digital Light Processing 3D Printer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smartphone&#8208;enabled Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printer based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a customized touchscreen smartphone app is developed, featuring portability, modularity, and an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use interface. The ability of printing with versatile materials covers commercial resins and several hydrogel&#8208;based (bio)inks. This platform is proven to be applicable to fabrication of medical implants, in situ bioprinting, and integration with a 3D object&#8208;scanning app.








Abstract
3D printing has emerged as an enabling approach in a variety of different fields. However, the bulk volume of printing systems limits the expansion of their applications. In this study, a portable 3D Digital Light Processing (DLP) printer is built based on a smartphone&#8208;powered projector and a custom&#8208;written smartphone&#8208;operated app. Constructs with detailed surface architectures, porous features, or hollow structures, as well as sophisticated tissue analogs, are successfully printed using this platform, by utilizing commercial resins as well as a range of hydrogel&#8208;based inks, including poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;diacrylate, gelatin methacryloyl, or allylated gelatin. Moreover, due to the portability of the unique DLP printer, medical implants can be fabricated for point&#8208;of&#8208;care usage, and cell&#8208;laden tissues can be produced in situ, achieving a new milestone for mobile&#8208;health technologies. Additionally, the all&#8208;in&#8208;one printing system described herein enables the integration of the 3D scanning smartphone app to obtain object&#8208;derived 3D digital models for subsequent printing. Along with further developments, this portable, modular, and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use smartphone&#8208;enabled DLP printer is anticipated to secure exciting opportunities for applications in resource&#8208;limited and point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings not only in biomedicine but also for home and educational purposes.

         <title>Avoiding the Center&#8208;Symmetry Trap: Programmed Assembly of Dipolar Precursors into Porous, Crystalline Molecular Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic building units on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This programmed assembly yields electric fields orientated normal to the substrate. This electrostatic design creates possibilities for band structure engineering and also results in nonlinear optical activity (second&#8208;harmonic generation).








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;phase, quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth is used to stack asymmetric, dipolar organic compounds on inorganic substrates, permitting porous, crystalline molecular materials that lack inversion symmetry. This allows material fabrication with built&#8208;in electric fields. A new programmed assembly strategy based on metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is described that facilitates crystalline, noncentrosymmetric space groups for achiral compounds. Electric fields are integrated into crystalline, porous thin films with an orientation normal to the substrate. Changes in electrostatic potential are detected via core&#8208;level shifts of marker atoms on the MOF thin films and agree with theoretical results. The integration of built&#8208;in electric fields into organic, crystalline, and porous materials creates possibilities for band structure engineering to control the alignment of electronic levels in organic molecules. Built&#8208;in electric fields may also be used to tune the transfer of charges from donors loaded via programmed assembly into MOF pores. Applications include organic electronics, photonics, and nonlinear optics, since the absence of inversion symmetry results in a clear second&#8208;harmonic generation signal.

         <title>Ordered Macroporous Carbonous Frameworks Implanted with CdS Quantum Dots for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped&#8208;carbon&#8208;supported CdS quantum dots are fabricated via an in situ transformation strategy. The as&#8208;prepared materials exhibit superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under the irradiation of visible light in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction is regarded as a promising way to simultaneously mitigate the energy crisis and CO2 pollution. However, achieving high efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction, especially without the assistance of sacrifice reagents or extra alkaline additives, remains a critical issue. Herein, a photocatalyst of 3D ordered macroporous N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) supported CdS quantum dots (3DOM CdSQD/NC) is successfully fabricated toward photocatalytic CO2 reduction via an in situ transformation strategy. Additionally, an amines oxidation reaction is introduced to replace the H2O oxidation process to further boost the photocatalytic CO2 reduction efficiency. Impressively, 3DOM CdSQD/NC exhibits superior activity and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction coupled with amines oxidation, affording a CO production rate as high as 5210 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 in the absence of any sacrificial agents and alkaline additives. Moreover, 3DOM CdSQD/NC achieves an apparent quantum efficiency of 2.9% at 450 nm. Mechanism studies indicate that the 3D ordered macropores in the NC matrix are beneficial to the transfer of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the highly dispersed CdS QDs on the NC skeleton are able to significantly promote the adsorption of both CO2 and amine molecules and depress the CO2 activation energy barriers by stabilizing the *COOH intermediate, directly contributing to the high activity.

         <title>Significant Improvements in Dielectric Constant and Energy Density of Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites Enabled by Ultralow Contents of Nanofillers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric polymer nanocomposites with ultralow filler loadings exhibit considerably improved dielectric constant and breakdown strength, giving rise to remarkable discharged energy densities. A mathematical model is established to predict the dielectric constant of composites with low filler contents, revealing the significant contribution of the interphase to the polarization.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with excellent processability and high breakdown strength (Eb) enable the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. Although the improvement of dielectric constant (K) of polymer dielectric has been realized by adding high&#8208;K inorganic fillers with high contents (&gt;10 vol%), this approach faces significant challenges in scalable film processing. Here, the incorporation of ultralow ratios (&lt;1 vol%) of low&#8208;K Cd1&#8722;xZnxSe1&#8722;ySy nanodots into a ferroelectric polymer is reported. The polymer composites exhibit substantial and concurrent increase in both K and Eb, yielding a discharged energy density of 26.0 J cm&#8722;3, outperforming the current dielectric polymers and nanocomposites measured at &#8804;600 MV m&#8722;1. The observed unconventional dielectric enhancement is attributed to the structural changes induced by the nanodot fillers, including transformation of polymer chain conformation and induced interfacial dipoles, which have been confirmed by density function theory calculations. The dielectric model established in this work addresses the limitations of the current volume&#8208;average models on the polymer composites with low filler contents and gives excellent agreement to the experimental results. This work provides a new experimental route to scalable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer dielectrics and also advances the fundamental understanding of the dielectric behavior of polymer nanocomposites at atomistic scales.

         <title>New Structure Mass Tag based on Zr&#8208;NMOF for Multiparameter and Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Interrogating in Mass Cytometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high specificity and sensitivity of a Zr mass tag in concert with the exploitation of four additional detection channels compatible with MCP_Abs indicates a great promise for developing nanoscale metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based mass tags as next&#8208;generation molecular probes in CyTOF for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating.








Abstract
Mass cytometry, also called cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF), is an emerging powerful proteomic analysis technique that utilizes metal chelated polymer (MCP) as mass tags for interrogating high&#8208;dimensional biomarkers simultaneously on millions of individual cells. However, under the typical polymer&#8208;based mass tag system, the sensitivity and multiplexing detection ability has been highly restricted. Herein, a new structure mass tag based on a nanometal organic framework (NMOF) is reported for multiparameter and sensitive single&#8208;cell biomarker interrogating in CyTOF. A uniform&#8208;sized Zr&#8208;NMOF (33 nm)&#160;carrying 105 metal ions is synthesized under modulator/reaction time coregulation, which is monodispersed and colloidally stable in water for over one&#8208;year storage. On functionalization with an antibody, the Zr mass tag exhibits specific molecular recognition properties and minimal cross&#8208;reaction toward nontargeted cells. In addition, the Zr&#8208;mass tag is compatible with MCP mass tags in a multiparameter assay for mouse spleen cells staining, which exploits four additional channels, m/z&#160;= 90, 91, 92, 94, for single&#8208;cell immunoassays in CyTOF. Compared to the MCP mass tag, the Zr&#8208;mass tag provides an additional fivefold signal amplification. This work provides the fundamental technical capability for exploiting NMOF&#8208;based mass tags for CyTOF application, which opens up possibility of high&#8208;dimensional single&#8208;cell immune profiling, low abundant antigen detection, and development of new barcoding systems.

         <title>Accelerating Ion Dynamics Under Cryogenic Conditions by the Amorphization of Crystalline Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphization is an effective strategy to promote low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by promoting fast charge transfer at the electrolyte&#8211;electrode interface and relieving the blocking effect of dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. The synthesized amorphous organic electrode exhibits an unprecedented specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at an ultralow temperature of &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The normal operation of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) at ultralow temperature (&lt;&#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) is significant for cold&#8208;climate applications; however, their operation is plagued by the low capacity of the conventional intercalation cathodes due to their sluggish kinetics and the slow solid diffusion of Li+ in their frameworks. Here, it is demonstrated that amorphization is an effective strategy to promote the low&#8208;temperature dynamics of cathodes by relieving the blocking effect of a dense lattice structure on ion transport under cryogenic conditions. As a result, due to the decreased charge transport impedance and enhanced Li+ diffusion rate, the obtained covalent amorphous polymer (CAP) with an abundance of pyrazine and carbonyl active sites displays a remarkably outstanding specific capacity of 141 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C, which is superior to its structural analog, a covalent crystalline polymer (43.8 mAh g&#8722;1). Furthermore, 84.7% of the initial capacity of the CAP can be retained after 500 cycles of charge and discharge at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. Molecular dynamic simulations show that the channel&#8208;rich amorphous structure is highly conducive for lithium ions to diffuse quickly in the interstitial space of organic solids. This work provides an effective strategy regarding the amorphization of crystalline cathodes to develop low&#8208;temperature (Low&#8208;T) batteries.

         <title>Rapid Capture of Cancer Extracellular Vesicles by Lipid Patch Microarrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular vesicles have great prospects as diagnostic and therapeutic tools. However, their isolation still poses challenges. A novel supported lipid&#8208;membrane&#8208;based platform is introduced for rapid capture, with high specificity and sensitivity, only a small needed analyte volume, and without additional purification steps. The platform is flexible and can be applied to many targets by corresponding antibodies.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) contain various bioactive molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, and play a key role in the regulation of cancer progression. Furthermore, cancer&#8208;associated EVs carry specific biomarkers and can be used in liquid biopsy for cancer detection. However, it is still technically challenging and time consuming to detect or isolate cancer&#8208;associated EVs from complex biofluids (e.g., blood). Here, a novel EV&#8208;capture strategy based on dip&#8208;pen nanolithography generated microarrays of supported lipid membranes is presented. These arrays carry specific antibodies recognizing EV&#8208; and cancer&#8208;specific surface biomarkers, enabling highly selective and efficient capture. Importantly, it is shown that the nucleic acid cargo of captured EVs is retained on the lipid array, providing the potential for downstream analysis. Finally, the feasibility of EV capture from patient sera is demonstrated. The demonstrated platform offers rapid capture, high specificity, and sensitivity, with only a small need in analyte volume and without additional purification steps. The platform is applied in context of cancer&#8208;associated EVs, but it can easily be adapted to other diagnostic EV targets by use of corresponding antibodies.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Vertically Aligned Bismuthene Nanosheet Arrays from Galvanic Replacement Reaction for Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to grow on various Cu substrates via the galvanic replacement reaction. They feature small nanosheet thickness, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between the nanosheets, and can enable efficient and robust CO2 reduction to formate in aqueous solution.








Abstract
There is a lack of straightforward methods to prepare high&#8208;quality bismuthene nanosheets, or, even more challengingly, to grow their arrays due to the low melting point and high oxophilicity of bismuth. This synthetic obstacle has hindered their potential applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that the galvanic replacement reaction can do the trick. Under well&#8208;controlled conditions, large&#8208;area vertically aligned bismuthene nanosheet arrays are grown on Cu substrates of various shapes and sizes. The product features small nanosheet thickness of two to three atomic layers, large surface areas, and abundant porosity between nanosheets. Most remarkably, bismuthene nanosheet arrays grown on Cu foam can enable efficient CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency of &gt;90%, large current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and great stability.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Valent Palladium Single&#8208;Atoms Catalysts Confined in Black Phosphorus for Efficient Semi&#8208;Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;valent palladium single&#8208;atoms catalysts confined in black phosphorus are successfully synthesized via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This BP&#8208;based SAC with metallic Pd1/P shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, opening up new avenues for designing zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for a wide range of organic transformations.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their remarkable catalytic properties and maximized atomic utilization. However, single atoms often bond to the support with polarized electron density and thus exhibit a high valence state, limiting their catalytic scopes in many chemical transformations. Here, it is demonstrated that 2D black phosphorus (BP) acts as giant phosphorus (P) ligand to confine a high density of single atoms (e.g., Pd1, Pt1) via atomic layer deposition. Unlike other 2D materials, BP with relatively low electronegativity and buckled structure favors the strong confinement of robust zero&#8208;valent palladium SACs in the vacancy site. Metallic Pd1/BP SAC shows a highly selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, distinct from metallic Pd nanoparticles that facilitate the formation of fully hydrogenated products. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pd atom forms covalent&#8208;like bonding with adjacent P atoms, wherein H atoms tend to adsorb, aiding the dissociative adsorption of H2. Zero&#8208;valent Pd in the confined space favors a larger energy gain for the synthesis of partially hydrogenated product over the fully hydrogenated one. This work provides a new route toward the synthesis of zero&#8208;valent SACs on BP for organic transformations.

&lt;p&gt;Zero-valent palladium single-atoms catalysts confined in black phosphorus are successfully synthesized via atomic layer deposition (ALD). This BP-based SAC with metallic Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/P shows a highly selective semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, opening up new avenues for designing zero-valent SACs on BP for a wide range of organic transformations.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-atom catalysts (SACs) represent a new frontier in heterogeneous catalysis due to their remarkable catalytic properties and maximized atomic utilization. However, single atoms often bond to the support with polarized electron density and thus exhibit a high valence state, limiting their catalytic scopes in many chemical transformations. Here, it is demonstrated that 2D black phosphorus (BP) acts as giant phosphorus (P) ligand to confine a high density of single atoms (e.g., Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Pt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) via atomic layer deposition. Unlike other 2D materials, BP with relatively low electronegativity and buckled structure favors the strong confinement of robust zero-valent palladium SACs in the vacancy site. Metallic Pd&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/BP SAC shows a highly selective semi-hydrogenation of phenylacetylene toward styrene, distinct from metallic Pd nanoparticles that facilitate the formation of fully hydrogenated products. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Pd atom forms covalent-like bonding with adjacent P atoms, wherein H atoms tend to adsorb, aiding the dissociative adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Zero-valent Pd in the confined space favors a larger energy gain for the synthesis of partially hydrogenated product over the fully hydrogenated one. This work provides a new route toward the synthesis of zero-valent SACs on BP for organic transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Triarylamine&#8208;Pyridine&#8208;Carbonitriles for Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices with EQE Nearly 40%</title>

Three 2,6&#8208;diphenylpyridine&#8208;3,5&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based compounds with excellent photoluminescent quantum yields (79&#8211;100%) and high horizontal dipole ratios (86&#8722;88%) in the thin films are demonstrated. With two methyl groups on the triarylamines, the spin&#8722;orbit coupling is enhanced due to the elevated locally excited triplet states (3LE), leading to a fast reverse intersystem crossing. Green thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them exhibit a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 39.8% without any optical extraction technique.








Abstract
Highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules are in urgent demand for solid&#8208;state lighting and full&#8208;color displays. Here, the design and synthesis of three triarylamine&#8208;pyridine&#8208;carbonitrile&#8208;based TADF compounds, TPAPPC, TPAmPPC, and tTPAmPPC, are shown. They exhibit excellent photoluminescence quantum yields of 79&#8722;100% with small &#916;EST values, fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC), and high horizontal dipole ratios (&#920;//&#160;= 86&#8722;88%) in the thin films leading to the enhancement of device light outcoupling. Consequently, a green organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on TPAmPPC shows a high average external quantum efficiency of 38.8&#160;&#177; 0.6%, a current efficiency of 130.1&#160;&#177; 2.1&#160;cd A&#8211;1, and a power efficiency of 136.3&#160;&#177; 2.2&#160;lm W&#8211;1. The highest device efficiency of 39.8% appears to be record&#8208;breaking among TADF&#8208;based OLEDs to date. In addition, the TPAmPPC&#8208;based device shows superior operation lifetime and high&#8208;temperature resistance. It is worth noting that the TPA&#8208;PPC&#8208;based materials have excellent optical properties and the potential for making them strong candidates for TADF practical application.

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of chiral liquid&#8208;crystal phase, the polar cholesteric phase, is realized. In addition to the unique dielectric property succeeded from the polar nematic host, the polar cholesteric phase is distinct from the conventional cholesteric phase due to the non&#8208;degeneracy of the local nematic director, as observed in the fundamental optical behaviors in wedge&#8208;cells or under E&#8208;fields.








Abstract
A novel chiral nematic phase with a polar helical order is realized via the introduction of helical twisting power into a polar nematogen. The properties of the induced polar nematic (polar cholesteric: Np*) phase differ from those of the conventional cholesteric (N*) phases existing thus far. Np*, which is a new class of N* structures, is characterized not only by its helically twisted nematic director, but also by a continuously twisted polarization. Transmission spectroscopy and helical pitch measurements in a wedge cell revealed that the half&#8208;helical pitch in the Np* phase vanished because of the polar response in the Np* helix. The inner polar director in the Np* phase is confirmed in dielectric and second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation studies. Furthermore, this unique Np*LC, which corresponds to a half&#8208;/full&#8208;pitch helix, enables ultrafast electro&#8208;optic switching (&#964;&#160;&lt;&#160;20&#160;&#181;s), and proposes new potential applications for electrically interchangeable photonic bandgaps.

         <title>The Manufacture of Unbreakable Bionics via Multifunctional and Self&#8208;Healing Silk&#8211;Graphene Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that transmit electricity like the human body can open new opportunities. For seamless mirroring of our&#160;anatomy, they also need to conform to its curvilinear architecture, and display self&#8208;healing ability like native organs and tissues. To address this, a conductive, adhesive, reconfigurable, and viscoelastic gum (CareGum), with promising applications in cyborganics, bionics, and soft robotics, is developed.








Abstract
Biomaterials capable of transmitting signals over longer distances than those in rigid electronics can open new opportunities for humanity by mimicking the way tissues propagate information. For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as, reproducing native&#8208;like mechanical and electrical properties combined with the ability to self&#8208;heal on demand like native organs and tissues. Along these lines, a multifunctional composite is developed by mixing silk fibroin and reduced graphene oxide. The material is coined &#8220;CareGum&#8221; and capitalizes on a phenolic glue to facilitate sacrificial and hierarchical hydrogen bonds. The hierarchal bonding scheme gives rise to high mechanical toughness, record&#8208;breaking elongation capacity of &#8776;25 000%, excellent conformability to arbitrary and complex surfaces, 3D printability, a tenfold increase in electrical conductivity, and a fourfold increase in Young's modulus compared to its pristine counterpart. By taking advantage of these unique properties, a durable and self&#8208;healing bionic glove is developed for hand gesture sensing and sign translation. Indeed, CareGum is a new advanced material with promising applications in fields like cyborganics, bionics, soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, 3D&#8208;printed electronics, and flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>Chiral Helimagnetism and One&#8208;Dimensional Magnetic Solitons in a Cr&#8208;Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral helimagnetism and 1D magnetic solitons are discovered in Cr&#8208;intercalated 2H&#8208;TaS2. The chiral helimagnetic structure has an initial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm, and it transforms into a chiral soliton lattice in an external magnetic field. The spatial period evolution of this topological spin texture obeys the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, revealing great potential for fast&#8208;speed racetrack memories.








Abstract
Chiral magnets endowed with topological spin textures are expected to have promising applications in next&#8208;generation magnetic memories. In contrast to the well&#8208;studied 2D or 3D magnetic skyrmions, the authors report the discovery of 1D nontrivial magnetic solitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide 2H&#8208;TaS2 via precise intercalation of Cr elements. In the synthetic Cr1/3TaS2 (CTS) single crystal, the coupling of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction from TaS2 and the chiral arrangement of the magnetic Cr ions evoke a robust Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. A magnetic helix having a short spatial period of &#8776;25&#160;nm is observed in CTS via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, the helical spin structure transforms into a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) with the spin structure evolution being consistent with the chiral sine&#8208;Gordon theory, which opens promising perspectives for the application of CSL to fast&#8208;speed nonvolatile magnetic memories. This work introduces a new paradigm to soliton physics and provides an effective strategy for seeking novel 2D magnets.

In contrast to the well-studied 2D or 3D magnetic skyrmions, the authors report the discovery of 1D nontrivial magnetic solitons in a transition metal dichalcogenide 2&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;-TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; via precise intercalation of Cr elements. In the synthetic Cr&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (CTS) single crystal, the coupling of the strong spin&#8211;orbit interaction from TaS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the chiral arrangement of the magnetic Cr ions evoke a robust Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. A magnetic helix having a short spatial period of &lt;b&gt;&#8776;&lt;/b&gt;25&#160;nm is observed in CTS via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the helical axis, the helical spin structure transforms into a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) with the spin structure evolution being consistent with the chiral sine-Gordon theory, which opens promising perspectives for the application of CSL to fast-speed nonvolatile magnetic memories. This work introduces a new paradigm to soliton physics and provides an effective strategy for seeking novel 2D magnets.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Penta&#8208;PdPSe: A New 2D Pentagonal Material with Highly In&#8208;Plane Optical, Electronic, and Optoelectronic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 2D pentagonal material, penta&#8208;PdPSe, with low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics, is introduced to the 2D family. Such a low&#8208;symmetry structure endows this material with strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy, in which high conductance and photoresponsivity anisotropic ratios of 4.74 and 6.17 are achieved, respectively. These results make 2D penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.








Abstract
Due to their low&#8208;symmetry lattice characteristics and intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy, 2D pentagonal materials, a new class of 2D materials composed entirely of pentagonal atomic rings, are attracting increasing research attention. However, the existence of these 2D materials has not been proven experimentally until the recent discovery of PdSe2. Herein, penta&#8208;PdPSe, a new 2D pentagonal material with a novel low&#8208;symmetry puckered pentagonal structure, is introduced to the 2D family. Interestingly, a peculiar polyanion of [Se&#63743;P&#63743;P&#63743;Se]4&#8722; is discovered in this material, which is the biggest polyanion in 2D materials yet discovered. Strong intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropic behavior endows penta&#8208;PdPSe with highly anisotropic optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties. Impressively, few&#8208;layer penta&#8208;PdPSe&#8208;based phototransistor not only achieves excellent electronic performances, a moderate electron mobility of 21.37 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a high on/off ratio of up to 108, but it also has a high photoresponsivity of &#8776;5.07&#160;&#215; 103 A W&#8722;1 at 635&#160;nm, which is ascribed to the photogating effect. More importantly, penta&#8208;PdPSe also exhibits a large anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;max&#160;= 3.85) and responsivity (Rmax/Rmin&#160;= 6.17 at 808&#160;nm), superior to most 2D anisotropic materials. These findings make penta&#8208;PdPSe an ideal material for the design of next&#8208;generation anisotropic devices.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Design of a Self&#8208;Adhesive Agent for Durable Moisture Management and Bacterial Inhibition on PET Fabric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mussel&#8208;inspired hydrophilic agent based on the cation&#8211;&#960; interaction is developed with strong self&#8208;adhesion on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric to form a durable superhydrophilic and antibacterial coating. It shows great potential in designing a Janus PET fabric for efficient sweat/heat management and bacterial inhibition without interfering the balance of the skin microflora, which is highly valued in physiological health and long&#8208;term wearing.








Abstract
Functional textiles with advanced moisture management can enhance human comfort and physiological health. However, conventional wet finishing processes used for textiles are usually highly polluting and exhibit poor fastness. Inspired by the strong underwater adhesion properties of mussels based on cation&#8211;&#960; interaction, a novel superhydrophilic polymeric molecule with strong cohesion and adhesion property is designed on a poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) fabric. The cation&#8211;&#960; hydrophilic agent (CPHA) can efficiently transform the hydrophobic PET fabric to a superhydrophilic one, and its superhydrophilicity can withstand 150 home laundry cycles. In addition, the cationic moieties in the CPHA self&#8208;adhere to the PET fabric without any finishing auxiliary that would cause pollution. Due to its strong adhesion, CPHA can be applied to one side of the PET fabric via spray coating and curing to form a Janus hydrophobic/superhydrophilic fabric capable of diode&#8208;like one&#8208;way sweat transportation (with forward transportation capability of 1115% and backward transportation capability of &#8722;1509%). Moreover, the Janus fabric inhibits bacterial growth and invasion, while simultaneously preserving the inner ecological healthy balance of the skin's microflora. This work opens up a pathway to develop adhesives in textile wet processing for more diverse, smarter applications, e.g., quick&#8208;dry sportswear, protective suits, or air&#8208;conditioning fabrics.

         <title>Facile Production of Phosphorene Nanoribbons towards Application in Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) are prepared by a facile electrochemical exfoliation with a high yield of &gt;80%. The PNR film acts as a protective layer on a lithium&#8208;metal anode to form a Li+&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting Li3P interface that enables long&#8208;time cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Like phosphorene, phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) promises exotic properties but unzipping phosphorene into edge&#8208;defined PNR is non&#8208;trivial because of uncontrolled cutting of phosphorene along random directions. Here a facile electrochemical strategy to fabricate zigzag&#8208;edged PNRs in high yield (&gt;80%) is reported. The presence of chemically active zigzag edges in PNR allows it to spontaneously react with Li to form a Li+ ion conducting Li3P phase, which can be used as a protective layer on Li metal anode in lithium metal batteries (LMBs). PNR protective layer prevents the parasitic reaction between lithium metal and electrolyte and promotes Li+ ion diffusion kinetics, enabling homogenous Li+ ion flux and long&#8208;time cycling stability up to 1100&#160;h at a current density of 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. LiFePO4|PNR&#8208;Li full&#8208;cell batteries with an areal capacity of 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, a lean electrolyte (20&#160;&#181;l&#160;mAh&#8722;1) and a negative/positive (N/P) electrodes ratio of 3.5 can be stably cycled over 100 cycles.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels for Rapid Water Disinfection and Sustainable Solar Vapor Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antibacterial hydrogels (ABHs) are designed as tablets for rapid water disinfection (&gt;99.999%) and can be easily removed from water without leaving chemical impurities. With excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be functional in solar water&#8208;purification technologies to enable stable distillate production after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water. 








Abstract
Consumption of unsafe water is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing regions. Pasteurizing or boiling water to remove pathogens is energy&#8208;intensive and often impractical to off&#8208;grid communities. Therefore, low capital cost, rapid and energy&#8208;efficient water disinfection methods are urgently required to address global challenges of safe water access. Here, anti&#8208;bacterial hydrogels (ABHs) with catechol&#8208;enabled molecular&#8208;level hydrogen peroxide generators and quinone&#8208;anchored activated carbon particles are designed for effective water treatment. The bactericidal effect is attributed to the synergy of hydrogen peroxide and quinone groups to attack essential cell components and disturb bacterial metabolism. ABHs can be directly used as tablets to achieve &gt;99.999% water disinfection efficiency within 60&#160;min without energy input. No harmful byproducts are formed during the treatment process, after which the ABH tablets can be easily removed without residues. Taking advantage of their excellent photothermal and biofouling&#8208;resistant properties, ABHs can also be applied as solar evaporators to achieve stable water purification under sunlight (&#8804;1&#160;kW m&#8722;2) after months of storage and operation in bacteria&#8208;containing river water.

&lt;p&gt;Antibacterial hydrogels (ABHs) are designed as tablets for rapid water disinfection (&amp;gt;99.999%) and can be easily removed from water without leaving chemical impurities. With excellent photothermal and biofouling-resistant properties, ABHs can also be functional in solar water-purification technologies to enable stable distillate production after months of storage and operation in bacteria-containing river water. 


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumption of unsafe water is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing regions. Pasteurizing or boiling water to remove pathogens is energy-intensive and often impractical to off-grid communities. Therefore, low capital cost, rapid and energy-efficient water disinfection methods are urgently required to address global challenges of safe water access. Here, anti-bacterial hydrogels (ABHs) with catechol-enabled molecular-level hydrogen peroxide generators and quinone-anchored activated carbon particles are designed for effective water treatment. The bactericidal effect is attributed to the synergy of hydrogen peroxide and quinone groups to attack essential cell components and disturb bacterial metabolism. ABHs can be directly used as tablets to achieve &amp;gt;99.999% water disinfection efficiency within 60&#160;min without energy input. No harmful byproducts are formed during the treatment process, after which the ABH tablets can be easily removed without residues. Taking advantage of their excellent photothermal and biofouling-resistant properties, ABHs can also be applied as solar evaporators to achieve stable water purification under sunlight (&lt;b&gt;&#8804;&lt;/b&gt;1&#160;kW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) after months of storage and operation in bacteria-containing river water. The ABH platform offers reduced energy and chemical demands for point-of-use water treatment technologies in remote areas and emergency rescue applications.&lt;/p&gt;

The &gt;105 discrepancy between recent reports of proton diffusion constants in halide perovskites is analyzed and it is found that the lower value is likely correct. The higher diffusion rate determined from single crystals may be the result of high&#8208;diffusivity pathways.








Abstract
A recent report by Cahen and co&#8208;workers is examined that finds the diffusion constant for proton migration in methylammonium lead triiodide single crystals to be 2 &#215; 105&#8208;fold greater than that previously reported by Sadhu et&#160;al. By comparing the conversion of single crystals versus microcrystalline samples, it is concluded that proton diffusion in macroscopic single crystals is accelerated by the presence of defects acting as high&#8208;diffusivity paths.

         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Eppur si Muove: Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals&#8221;: Measure What is Measurable, and Make Measurable What is Not So: Discrepancies between Proton Diffusion in Halide Perovskite Single Crystals and Thin Films</title>

What can explain the 105 times difference higher value of the proton diffusion coefficient in iodide perovskite single crystals relative to other reported values in thin films? Instead of migration through imperfections, which is shown to be highly improbable, experimentally testable alternatives are proposed.








Abstract
Buffeteau et&#160;al. note that the proton diffusion coefficient in MAPbI3 that is deduced (by the authors) from results, obtained by a suite of complementary techniques, on a large number of single crystals (Adv. Mater. 2020, 32, 2002467) is 5 orders of magnitude higher than what is estimated (by them) in J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2020, 142, 10431, from infrared spectroscopy on ultrathin MAPbI3 films; use of (deuterium/hydrogen) D/H isotope substitution is common to both studies. Buffeteau et&#160;al. speculated that proton diffusion in halide perovskite single crystals is dominated by 1D defects, which will somehow not be present in thin films, as those are made up of small&#8208;sized crystallites. It is shown here that the idea of a 1D defect is not supported by the body of experimental data gathered on these crystals, that the statistical analysis employed in to Buffeteau et&#160;al. to support the criticism is problematic, and it is concluded that the source of the difference must lie elsewhere. Constructive suggestions for this difference are provided and experiments to discern between possible reasons for it are proposed.

Perovskite Photodetectors
In article number 2101714, Wei Tian, Liang Li, and co&#8208;workers report a practical method to adjust the phase distribution in 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites to construct efficient and stable perovskite photodetectors. The ordered arrangement of phase compositions facilitates the separation and transportation of photogenerated charge carriers, and endows the device with improved performance and environmental stability.

Microbatteries
The proliferation and performance of physically small electronics have been severely limited by the microbatteries that power them. In article number 2101760, John B. Cook, Paul V. Braun, James H. Pikul, and co&#8208;workers report a new design paradigm for primary microbatteries that drastically improves energy and power density through the use of thick and near&#8208;fully dense electrodeposited cathodes and multifunctional current collectors that eliminate most of the hermetic packaging.

Biocompatible Materials
The history of biomaterials began with naturally derived materials such as nacre and animal tissues. Gradually mankind developed more advanced materials such as metals, ceramics, alloys and polymers to yield prosthetics and implants. Flexible and reconfigurable materials such as &#8220;CareGum&#8221; are slowly changing the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art by yielding flexible human&#8211;machine interfaces (e.g., bionic eyes, brain implants, heart patches, and bionic wearables (like the electronic glove developed by Alireza Dolatshahi&#8208;Pirouz in article number 2100047)).

         <title>A New Class of Chiral Nematic Phase with Helical Polar Order (Adv. Mater. 35/2021)</title>

Liquid Crystals
A new class of cholesteric phase with local polar order is realized by Fumito Araoka and Hiroya Nishikawa in article number 2101305. In general, the periodicity of the conventional cholesteric liquid crystal corresponds to the half&#8208;pitch of the helix, having head&#8208;and&#8208;tail symmetry in the local nematic director. On the other hand, the newly found polar cholesteric liquid crystal is characterized with a full&#8208;pitch periodicity of the helix due to the polar degeneracy in the local nematic director. This delivers some unprecedented properties, such as fast electro&#8208;optic response based on the photonic band modulated with polar helix deformation.

         <title>Materials with Electroprogrammable Stiffness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel applications, such as soft robotics and haptics, require emerging material systems whose stiffness can be selectively programmed using an electrical input to increase performance and simplify designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials with electroprogrammable stiffness are reviewed, categorizing them into those governed by electrostatics and phase&#8208;changes, and identifying challenges and opportunities toward the next generation of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots. The numerous applications for materials with electrically driven stiffness modulation has driven a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Here, a comprehensive review of the available materials that realize electroprogrammable stiffness is provided, showing that all current approaches can be categorized as using electrostatics or electrically activated phase changes, and summarizing the advantages, limitations, and applications of these materials. Finally, a perspective identifies state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art trends and an outlook of future opportunities for the development and use of materials with electroprogrammable stiffness.

Respiration carries a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. An overview of TENG&#8208;enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion monitoring and chemical breath analysis, is presented.








Abstract
In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths, which has traditionally been an underutilized resource potentially encompassing a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low&#8208;cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG&#8208;based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part. Then the sensing mechanism, theoretical modeling, and applications related to detection of chemicals released from breathing gases are systemically summarized.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths, which has traditionally been an underutilized resource potentially encompassing a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self-powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low-cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG-based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self-powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part. Then the sensing mechanism, theoretical modeling, and applications related to detection of chemicals released from breathing gases are systemically summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of triboelectric effect enabled self-powered respiration monitoring are comprehensively discussed and criticized.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The rapid advances in the Internet of things and wearable devices have created a massive platform for sensor systems that detect chemical or biological agents. The accelerated development of these devices in recent years has simultaneously aggravated the power supply problems. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a thriving renewable energy technology with the potential to revolutionize this field. In this review, the significance of TENG&#8208;based sensor systems in chemical or biological detection from the perspective of the development of power supply for biochemical sensors is discussed. Further, a range of TENGs are classified according to their roles as power supplies and/or self&#8208;powered active sensors. The TENG powered sensor systems are further discussed on the basis of their framework and applications. The working principles and structures of different TENG&#8208;based self&#8208;powered active sensors are presented, along with the classification of the sensors based on these factors. In addition, some representative applications are introduced, and the corresponding challenges are discussed. Finally, some perspectives for the future innovations of TENG&#8208;based sensor systems for chemical/biological detection are discussed.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Tunneling Devices&#8212;From Electric&#8208;Field Driven to Optical&#8208;Field Driven</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast electron tunneling devices are summarized. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based electron transport devices, electron tunneling devices can provide, significantly, much faster response time due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs on femtosecond timescales. The central tenet of optical&#8208;field&#8208;driven tunneling devices is realizing sub&#8208;optical&#8208;cycle response lightwave electronics.








Abstract
The search for ever higher frequency information processing has become an area of intense research activity within the micro, nano, and optoelectronics communities. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based diffusive transport electron devices, electron tunneling devices provide significantly faster response times due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs at sub&#8208;femtosecond timescales. As a result, the enhanced performance of electron tunneling devices is demonstrated, time and again, to reimagine a wide variety of traditional electronic devices with a variety of new &#8220;lightwave electronics&#8221; emerging, each capable of reducing the electron transport channel transit time down to attosecond timescales. In response to unprecedented rapid progress within this field, here the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in electron tunneling devices is reviewed, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and possible future research directions are identified.

         <title>Energy Autonomous Sweat&#8208;Based Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 35, September 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweat&#8208;based energy harvesting and storage devices, along with the key components of sweat&#8208;based energy autonomous wearables systems are comprehensively reviewed. Various considerations such as the power management and the sweat extraction, etc., are discussed for continuous operation of sweat&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
The continuous operation of wearable electronics demands reliable sources of energy, currently met through Li&#8208;ion batteries and various energy harvesters. These solutions are being used out of necessity despite potential safety issues and unsustainable environmental impact. Safe and sustainable energy sources can boost the use of wearables systems in diverse applications such as health monitoring, prosthetics, and sports. In this regard, sweat&#8208; and sweat&#8208;equivalent&#8208;based studies have attracted tremendous attention through the demonstration of energy&#8208;generating biofuel cells, promising power densities as high as 3.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, storage using sweat&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based supercapacitors with energy and power densities of 1.36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and sweat&#8208;activated batteries with an impressive energy density of 67 Ah kg&#8722;1. A combination of these energy generating, and storage devices can lead to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables capable of providing sustainable power in the &#181;W to mW range, which is sufficient to operate both sensing and communication devices. Here, a comprehensive review covering these advances, addressing future challenges and potential solutions related to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables is presented, with emphasis on sweat&#8208;based energy storage and energy generation elements along with sweat&#8208;based sensors as applications.

         <title>Mn&#8208;Rich MnSb2Te4: A Topological Insulator with Magnetic Gap Closing at High Curie Temperatures of 45&#8211;50 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn&#8208;rich MnSb2Te4 is shown to exhibit ferromagnetic hysteresis with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy and Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K. It is a topological insulator with Dirac point close to the Fermi level and a magnetic gap that closes at the Curie temperature. These favorable properties are caused by excess Mn that substitutes Sb within the septuple layers.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic topological insulators exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect, which is potentially useful for high&#8208;precision metrology, edge channel spintronics, and topological qubits. &#160;The stable 2+ state of Mn enables intrinsic magnetic topological insulators. MnBi2Te4 is, however, antiferromagnetic with 25 K N&#233;el temperature and is strongly n&#8208;doped. In this work, p&#8208;type MnSb2Te4, previously considered topologically trivial, is shown to be a ferromagnetic topological insulator for a few percent Mn excess. i) Ferromagnetic hysteresis with record Curie temperature of 45&#8211;50 K, ii) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy, iii) a 2D Dirac cone with the Dirac point close to the Fermi level, iv) out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization as revealed by photoelectron spectroscopy, and v) a magnetically induced bandgap closing at the Curie temperature, demonstrated by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), are shown. Moreover, a critical exponent of the magnetization &#946;&#160;&#8776; 1 is found, indicating the vicinity of a quantum critical point. Ab initio calculations reveal that Mn&#8211;Sb site exchange provides the ferromagnetic interlayer coupling and the slight excess of Mn nearly doubles the Curie temperature. Remaining deviations from the ferromagnetic order open the inverted bulk bandgap and render MnSb2Te4 a robust topological insulator and new benchmark for magnetic topological insulators.

         <title>Force&#8208;Based Wetting Characterization of Stochastic Superhydrophobic Coatings at Nanonewton Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scanning droplet adhesion microscopy and micropipette&#8208;based droplet friction measurements are used for quantitative evaluation of the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings. These novel force&#8208;based characterization techniques provide a detailed picture of the wetting performance and heterogeneity of super&#8208;repellent surfaces, far beyond what is afforded by traditional contact angle measurements.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic coatings have extraordinary properties like self&#8208;cleaning and staying dry, and have recently appeared on industrial and consumer markets. The stochastic nature of the coating components and coating processes (e.g., spraying, painting) affects the uniformity of the water repellency across the coated substrate. The wetting properties of those coatings are typically quantified on macroscale using contact angle goniometry (CAG). Here, highly sensitive force&#8208;based methods, scanning droplet adhesion microscopy (SDAM), and micropipette force sensor (MFS), are used, to quantify the microscale heterogeneity in the wetting properties of stochastic superhydrophobic coatings with irregular surface topography that cannot be investigated by CAG. By mapping the wetting adhesion forces with SDAM and friction forces with MFS, it is demonstrated that even the best coatings on the market are prone to heterogeneities that induce stick&#8211;slip motion of droplets. Thus, owing to their high spatial and force resolution, the advantages of these techniques over CAG are demonstrated.

         <title>Bioinspired Functionally Graded Composite Assembled Using Cellulose Nanocrystals and Genetically Engineered Proteins with Controlled Biomineralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formulation of a graded multiphase nanocomposite that mimics key molecular and architectural features of the mantis shrimp dactyl club in the complex shape of dental implant crown, exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and toughness, is reported. The material consists of expanded helicoidaly organized cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins regulating both binding to CNCs and the growth of reinforcing apatite crystals.








Abstract
Nature provides unique insights into design strategies evolved by living organisms to construct robust materials with a combination of mechanical properties that are challenging to replicate synthetically. Hereby, inspired by the impact&#8208;resistant dactyl club of the stomatopod, a mineralized biocomposite is rationally designed and produced in the complex shapes of dental implant crowns exhibiting high strength, stiffness, and fracture toughness. This material consists of an expanded helicoidal organization of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) mixed with genetically engineered proteins that regulate both binding to CNCs and in situ growth of reinforcing apatite crystals. Critically, the structural properties emerge from controlled self&#8208;assembly across multiple length scales regulated by rational engineering and phase separation of the protein components. This work replicates multiscale biomanufacturing of a model biological material and also offers an innovative platform to synthesize multifunctional biocomposites whose properties can be finely regulated by colloidal self&#8208;assembly and engineering of its constitutive protein building blocks.

         <title>Programmable Multistable Perforated Shellular</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmable multidirectional multistable shellular metamaterials are developed by adding perforations on the Schwarz Primitive surface, where introducing elliptical holes can lead to the motif's structural bistability, while n&#8208;layer staggered perforations contribute to a maximum of 2n&#8722;1 stable states. Independent three&#8208;directional multistable perforated shellulars are demonstrated using transformations of a staggered perforated motif along the three orthogonal coordinate directions.








Abstract
Developing bistable metamaterials has recently offered a new design paradigm for deployable structures and reusable dampers. While most bistable mechanisms possess inclined/curved struts, a new 3D multistable shellular metamaterial is developed by introducing delicate perforations on the surface of Schwarz's Primitive shellular, integrating the unique properties of shellular materials such as high surface area, stiffness, and energy absorption with the multistability concept. Denoting the fundamental snapping part by motif, certain shellular motifs with elliptical perforations exhibit mechanical bistability. To bring the concept of multistability to a single motif, multistable shellular motifs are developed by introducing multilayer staggered perforations that form hinges and facilitate local instability. Adopting an n&#8208;layer staggered perforation (n hinges) design leads to a maximum 2n&#8722;1 stable states within one shellular motif during loading and unloading. Three&#8208;directional multistable shellulars are attained by extending the perforation design in three orthogonal directions. Harnessing snap&#8208;through and snap&#8208;back behaviors and self&#8208;contact, the introduced multistable perforated shellulars exhibit strong rigidity both in loading and unloading, and enhanced energy dissipation. The introduced design strategy opens up new horizons for creating multidirectional multistable metamaterials with load bearing capabilities for applications in soft robotics, shape&#8208;morphing architectures, and reusable and deployable energy absorbers/dampers.

         <title>Ultrathin PdAuBiTe Nanosheets as High&#8208;Performance Oxygen Reduction Catalysts for a Direct Methanol Fuel Cell Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin quaternary PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D&#160;nanosheets are first achieved by a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template strategy. As high&#8208;performance oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, the PdAuBiTe nanosheets can greatly increase power densities and durability in direct methanol fuel cell devices. The maximum power densities of PdAuBiTe nanosheets are up to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8211;2 in O2/air, respectively.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D metal nanostructures have sparked a lot of research interest because of their improved electrocatalytic properties for fuel cells. So far, no effective technique for preparing ultrathin 2D Pd&#8208;based metal nanostructures with more than three compositions has been published. Herein, a new visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced template technique for producing PdAuBiTe alloyed 2D ultrathin nanosheets is developed. The mass activity of the PdAuBiTe nanosheets against the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is 2.48 A mgPd&#8722;1, which is 27.5/17.7 times that of industrial Pd/C/Pt/C, respectively. After 10&#160;000 potential cyclings, there is no decrease in ORR activity. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets exhibit high methanol tolerance and in situ anti&#8208;CO poisoning properties. The PdAuBiTe nanosheets, as cathode electrocatalysts in direct methanol fuel cells, can thus give significant improvement in terms of power density and durability. In O2/air, the power density can be increased to 235.7/173.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2, higher than that reported in previous work, and which is 2.32/3.59 times higher than Pt/C.

         <title>Constructing Graphitic&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Bonded Pentagons in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Graphene Matrix toward Carbon&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in 0.1 m HClO4 is reported, with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based materials with high electrocatalytic activity are promising catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in several renewable energy systems. However, the performance of carbon&#8208;based materials is far inferior to that of Pt&#8208;based catalysts in acid electrolytes. Here, a novel carbon&#8208;based electrocatalyst is reported toward ORR in 0.1 m HClO4 with half&#8208;wave potential of 0.81&#160;V and better durability (100 h reaction time)&#160;than commercial 20 wt% Pt/C. It is achieved by constructing graphitic&#8208;nitrogen (GN)&#8208;bonded pentagons in graphitic carbon to improve the intrinsic activity of the carbon sites and increasing the amount of active sites via expanding the interlayer spacing. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected electron microscopy characterizations confirm the formation of GN&#8208;bonded pentagons in this carbon material. Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveal that the activity is linearly associated with the amounts of both pentagons and adjacent GN atoms. Density function theory further demonstrates that adjacent GN atoms significantly increase the charge density at the carbon atom of a GN&#8208;bonded pentagon, which is the activity origin for the ORR.

         <title>Ambulatory Cardiovascular Monitoring Via a Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Textile Triboelectric Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A waterproof textile&#8208;based wearable cardiovascular monitoring system is developed via a systematical integration of a triboelectric sensor, a signal processing circuit, a Bluetooth module, and a customized user&#8208;friendly APP interface. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, this system can perform continuous blood pressure monitoring against body motion and perspiration.








Abstract
Wearable bioelectronics for continuous and reliable pulse wave monitoring against body motion and perspiration remains a great challenge and highly desired. Here, a low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and mechanically durable textile triboelectric sensor that can convert subtle skin deformation caused by arterial pulsatility into electricity for high&#8208;fidelity and continuous pulse waveform monitoring in an ambulatory and sweaty setting is developed. The sensor holds a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 23.3 dB, a response time of 40 ms, and a sensitivity of 0.21 &#181;A kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of machine learning algorithms, the textile triboelectric sensor can continuously and precisely measure systolic and diastolic pressure, and the accuracy is validated via a commercial blood pressure cuff at the hospital. Additionally, a customized cellphone application (APP) based on built&#8208;in algorithm is developed for one&#8208;click health data sharing and data&#8208;driven cardiovascular diagnosis. The textile triboelectric sensor enabled wireless biomonitoring system is expected to offer a practical paradigm for continuous and personalized cardiovascular system characterization in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Photovoltaic Cell with 19% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By designing new donor/acceptor materials and combining a ternary blending strategy, a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) in single&#8208;junction organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells is achieved. It is demonstrated that finely tuning the light utilization and photophysical processes of the active layer has great potential for further improving the PCEs of OPV cells.








Abstract
Improving power conversion efficiency (PCE) is important for broadening the applications of organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Here, a maximum PCE of 19.0% (certified value of 18.7%) is achieved in single&#8208;junction OPV cells by combining material design with a ternary blending strategy. An active layer comprising a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer donor named PBQx&#8208;TF and a new low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) named eC9&#8208;2Cl is rationally designed. With optimized light utilization, the resulting binary cell exhibits a good PCE of 17.7%. An NFA F&#8208;BTA3 is then added to the active layer as a third component to simultaneously improve the photovoltaic parameters. The improved light unitization, cascaded energy level alignment, and enhanced intermolecular packing result in open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.879&#160;V, short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.7&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and fill factor of 0.809. This study demonstrates that further improvement of PCEs of high&#8208;performance OPV cells requires fine tuning of the electronic structures and morphologies of the active layers.

         <title>Quantum Oscillations in Ferromagnetic (Sb, V)2Te3 Topological Insulator Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of electric transport in Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 films demonstrates the coexistence of topological surface states and long&#8208;range ferromagnetism evidenced by Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations. Vanadium doping acts as an efficient tuning parameter for the Fermi surface size. This opens up a new route for the investigation of the crossover between different topological states based on this material class.








Abstract
An effective way of manipulating 2D surface states in magnetic topological insulators may open a new route for quantum technologies based on the quantum anomalous Hall effect. The doping&#8208;dependent evolution of the electronic band structure in the topological insulator Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.102) thin films is studied by means of electrical transport. Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films were&#160;prepared by molecular beam epitaxy, and Shubnikov&#8211;de Hass (SdH) oscillations are observed in both the longitudinal and transverse transport channels. Doping with the 3d element, vanadium, induces long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order with enhanced SdH oscillation amplitudes. The doping effect is systematically studied in various films depending on thickness and bottom gate voltage. The angle&#8208;dependence of the SdH oscillations reveals their 2D nature, linking them to topological surface states as their origin. Furthermore, it is shown that vanadium doping can efficiently modify the band structure. The tunability by doping and the coexistence of the surface states with ferromagnetism render Sb2&#8722;xVxTe3 thin films a promising platform for energy band engineering. In this way, topological quantum states may be manipulated to crossover from quantum Hall effect to quantum anomalous Hall effect, which opens an alternative route for the design of quantum electronics and spintronics.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Atomically Dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn Pair Sites for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic effect induced by electronic interactions is observed on novel atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn pair sites with superior activity and outstanding selectivity for CO2 electroreduction; better yet, the origin of this synergistic effect is revealed, both in the thermodynamic pathway and kinetic pathway.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;atom catalysts have the potential to outperform the well&#8208;established single&#8208;atom catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2. However, the lack of understanding regarding the mechanism of this enhanced catalytic process prevents the rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts. Herein, an obvious synergistic effect in atomically dispersed Ni&#8211;Zn bimetal sites is observed. In situ characterization combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveals that heteronuclear coordination modifies the d&#8208;states of the metal atom, narrowing the gap between the d&#8208;band centre (&#949;d) of the Ni (3d) orbitals and the Fermi energy level (EF) to strengthen the electronic interaction at the reaction interface, resulting in a lower free energy barrier (&#916;G) in the thermodynamic pathway and a reduced activation energy (Ea) as well as fortified metal&#8211;C bonding in the kinetic pathway. Consequently, a CO faradaic efficiency of &gt;90% is obtained across a broad potential window from &#8722;0.5 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V (vs RHE), reaching a maximum of 99% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V, superior to that of the Ni/Zn single&#8208;metal sites.

         <title>2D Ti3C2Tx MXenes: Visible Black but Infrared White Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultralow infrared emissivity of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations confirm this discovery and reveal other MXenes such as Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx are also low&#8208;emissivity materials. Such intrinsically visible black but infrared white materials that are rare in nature show great potential in solar&#8211;thermal conversion, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications.








Abstract
Black inorganic materials with low infrared absorption/emission (or IR white) are rare in nature but highly desired in numerous areas, such as solar&#8211;thermal energy harvesting, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic materials, such counter&#8208;intuitive properties are generally realized by constructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly nanofabrication techniques. Here, the intrinsically low mid&#8208;IR emissivity (down to 10%) of the 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is reported. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to 90%), it embraces the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic black solar&#8208;absorbing materials. Its appealing potential in several of the aforementioned areas is experimentally demonstrated. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXene relies on both the nanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The calculations also suggest more potential low&#8208;emissivity MXenes including Ti2CTx, Nb2CTx, and V2CTx. This work opens the avenue to further exploration of a family of intrinsically low&#8208;emissivity materials with over 70 members.

First-principles calculations confirm this discovery and reveal other MXenes such as Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; are also low-emissivity materials. Such intrinsically visible black but infrared white materials that are rare in nature show great potential in solar&#8211;thermal conversion, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti-counterfeiting applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black inorganic materials with low infrared absorption/emission (or IR white) are rare in nature but highly desired in numerous areas, such as solar&#8211;thermal energy harvesting, multispectral camouflage, thermal insulation, and anti-counterfeiting. Due to the lack of spectral selectivity in intrinsic materials, such counter-intuitive properties are generally realized by constructing complicated subwavelength metamaterials with costly nanofabrication techniques. Here, the intrinsically low mid-IR emissivity (down to 10%) of the 2D Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; MXene is reported. Associated with a high solar absorptance (up to 90%), it embraces the best spectral selectivity among the reported intrinsic black solar-absorbing materials. Its appealing potential in several of the aforementioned areas is experimentally demonstrated. First-principles calculations reveal that the IR emissivity of MXene relies on both the nanoflake orientations and terminal groups, indicating great tunability. The calculations also suggest more potential low-emissivity MXenes including Ti&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CT&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. This work opens the avenue to further exploration of a family of intrinsically low-emissivity materials with over 70 members.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Manipulating Electrocatalytic Li2S Redox via Selective Dual&#8208;Defect Engineering for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common MoSe2 electrocatalyst synergizing N&#8208;doping and Se&#8208;vacancy enables optimal Li2S electrocatalytic manipulation toward favorable bidirectional sulfur redox chemistry with high electrocatalytic selectivity, accordingly achieving excellent rate performance, cycling stability, and areal capacity in pursuit of working Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage, yet they are plagued by the notorious polysulfide shuttle effect and sluggish redox kinetics. While rationally designed redox mediators can facilitate polysulfide conversion, favorable bidirectional sulfur electrocatalysis remains a formidable challenge. Herein, selective dual&#8208;defect engineering (i.e., introducing both N&#8208;doping and Se&#8208;vacancies) of a common MoSe2 electrocatalyst is used to manipulate the bidirectional Li2S redox. Systematic theoretical prediction and detailed electrokinetic analysis reveal the selective electrocatalytic effect of the two types of defects, thereby achieving a deeper mechanistic understanding of the bidirectional sulfur electrochemistry. The Li&#8211;S battery using this electrocatalyst exhibits excellent cyclability, with a low capacity decay rate of 0.04% per cycle over 1000 cycles at 2.0 C. More impressively, the potential for practical applications is highlighted by a high areal capacity (7.3 mAh cm&#8722;2) and the construction of a flexible pouch cell. Such selective electrocatalysis created by dual&#8208;defect engineering is an appealing approach toward working Li&#8211;S systems.

         <title>Mo2N&#8211;W2N Heterostructures Embedded in Spherical Carbon Superstructure as Highly Efficient Polysulfide Electrocatalysts for Stable Room&#8208;Temperature Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Mo2N&#8211;W2N heterostructures embedded in spherical carbon superstructure (Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC) are designed as the S hosts for room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries. The Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC can efficiently suppress the polysulfide shuttling, promote the redox reactions, and catalyze the fast conversion of sodium polysulfides.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are highly desirable for a sustainable large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage system due to their high energy density and low cost. Nevertheless, practical applications of RT Na&#8211;S batteries are still prevented by the shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides (NaPS), slow reaction kinetics of S, and incomplete conversion process of NaPS. Here, Mo2N&#8211;W2N heterostructures embedded in a spherical carbon superstructure (Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC) are designed to efficiently suppress the &#8220;polysulfide shuttle&#8221; and promote NaPS redox reactions. The designed Mo2N&#8211;W2N@PC heterostructure with abundant heterointerfaces, high conductivity, and porosity can facilitate electron/ion diffusion and provide high catalytic activity for efficient NaPS conversion. The obtained Na&#8211;S battery delivers high reversible capacity with superior long&#8208;term cyclability (517 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles) and unprecedented rate capability (417 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the electrocatalysis mechanism is revealed by combining in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV&#8211;vis spectra, and precipitation experiments. This work demonstrates a novel heterostructure design strategy that enables high&#8208;performance Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Engineering Chameleon Prodrug Nanovesicles to Increase Antigen Presentation and Inhibit PD&#8208;L1 Expression for Circumventing Immune Resistance of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chameleon&#8208;inspired prodrug nanovesicles are developed for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery and second&#8208;near&#8208;IR fluorescence&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided release of autophagy inhibitor doxycycline (Doxy) and bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 inhibitor JQ1. Prodrug nanovesicle&#8208;based treatment conquers both the intrinsic and inducible immune resistance by simultaneously augmenting antigen presentation with Doxy, and diminishing programmed death ligand 1 expression on the surface of the tumor cells with JQ1.








Abstract
Immune evasion is the major obstacle for T&#8208;cell&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy. The insufficient expression of the tumor&#8208;rejection antigen causes the intrinsic immune resistance and high expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) induced by interferon gamma (IFN&#8208;&#947;), which accounts for the inducible immune resistance. To deal with both the intrinsic and inducible immune resistance of cancer, a multifunctional prodrug nanovesicle is sequentially developed. It is first sorted out that doxycycline (Doxy) efficiently inhibits autophagy of the tumor cells, and increases the surface level of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC&#8208;I). Then, chameleon&#8208;inspired prodrug nanovesicles are engineered for tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of Doxy. The prodrug nanovesicles integrating a sheddable poly(ethylene glycol) shell and CRGDK ligand are kept stable during blood circulation, while exposing the targeting ligand in the tumor, which significantly inhibits autophagy, elicits MHC&#8208;I expression, increases tumor antigen presentation, recruits more tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes, and suppresses FN&#8208;&#947;&#8208;induced intratumoral PD&#8208;L1 expression. After a proof of concept for overcoming intrinsic and inducible immune evasion, the prodrug nanovesicles are applied to validate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy in two tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This research thus provides a novel targeting strategy for reducing tumor immune resistance and potentiating tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Dilute Aqueous&#8208;Aprotic Hybrid Electrolyte Enabling a Wide Electrochemical Window through Solvation Structure Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dilute aqueous&#8208;aprotic hybrid electrolyte is developed with broad electrochemical window. The introduced aprotic solvent can regulate the solvation structures of the electrolyte and the water molecules are strongly confined around the Na cations. As a result, in such a hybrid electrolyte, the decomposition of water is suppressed and the electrochemical window of the water is broadened.








Abstract
The application of superconcentrated aqueous electrolytes has shown great potential in developing high&#8208;voltage electrochemical double&#8208;layer capacitors (EDLCs). However, the broadening of the electrochemical window of such superconcentrated electrolytes is at the expense of their high cost, low ionic conductivity, high density, and narrow operating temperature range. Herein, the electrochemical window of water (&gt;3&#160;V) at low salt concentration (3 m) is expanded by using an aprotic solvent, i.e., trimethyl phosphate (TMP), to regulate the solvation structure of the electrolyte. Benefiting from the low salt concentration, such electrolyte is simultaneously featured with high ionic conductivity, low density, and wide temperature compatibility. Based on the dilute hybrid electrolyte, EDLCs constructed by using porous graphene electrodes are able to operate within an enlarged voltage range of 0&#8211;2.4&#160;V at a wide range of temperatures from &#8722;20 to 60&#160;&#176;C. They also present excellent rate capability and cycle stability, i.e., 83% capacitance retention after 100&#160;000 cycles. Density functional theory calculations verify that TMP induces a significant electronic modulation for the bonding environment of the electrolyte. This enables the stronger binding of Na+&#8211;H2O with freely migrating TMP to expand the voltage window to exceed the potential limitation of aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

         <title>Vectorial Compound Metapixels for Arbitrary Nonorthogonal Polarization Steganography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vectorial compound metapixel design enables independent and linear modulations of the output beam in both amplitude and polarization rotations across the Malus metasurface. With this, arbitrary&#8208;angle steganography is demonstrated by both multiplexing two continuous grayscale images in arbitrary nonorthogonal polarization angles and concealing one grayscale image on another in an arbitrary disclosure angle window.








Abstract
Malus&#8217; law regulating the intensity of light when passed through a polarizer, forms the solid basis for image steganography based on orthogonal polarizations of light to convey hidden information without adverse perceptions, which underpins important practices in information encryptions, anti&#8208;counterfeitings, and security labels. Unfortunately, the restriction to orthogonal states being taken for granted in the common perceptions fails to advance cryptoinformation to upgraded levels of security. By introducing a vectorial compound metapixel design, arbitrary nonorthogonal polarization multiplexing of independent grayscale images with high fidelity and strong concealment is demonstrated. The Jones matrix treatment of compound metapixels consisting of double atoms with tailored in&#8208;plane orientation sum and difference allows point&#8208;by&#8208;point configuring of both the amplitude and polarization rotations of the output beam in an analytical and linear form. With this, both multiplexing two continuous grayscale images in arbitrary nonorthogonal polarization angles and concealing grayscale image on another in an arbitrary disclosure angle window are experimentally demonstrated in the visible TiO2 metasurface platform. The methods shed new light on multifarious metaoptics by harnessing the new degree of freedom and unlock the full potential of metasurface polarization optics.

         <title>A Soft Variable&#8208;Area Electrical&#8208;Double&#8208;Layer Energy Harvester</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal encased in a hydrogel naturally forms an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor. Mechanical deformation of these soft and stretchable materials causes the interfacial area and thus capacitance to increase, which can drive current through an external circuit. This unique combination of materials allows the device to convert multiple modes of mechanical deformation into electricity both in air and underwater.








Abstract
The technological promise of soft devices&#8212;wearable electronics, implantables, soft robotics, sensors&#8212;has accelerated the demand for deformable energy sources. Devices that can convert mechanical energy to electrical energy can enable self&#8208;powered, tetherless, and sustainable devices. This work presents a completely soft and stretchable (&gt;400% strain) energy harvester based on variable&#8208;area electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer (EDL) capacitors (&#8776;40&#160;&#181;F&#160;cm&#8722;2). Mechanically varying the EDL area, and thus the capacitance, disrupts equilibrium and generates a driving force for charge movement through an external circuit. Prior EDL capacitors varied the contact area by depressing water droplets between rigid electrodes. In contrast, here, the harvester consists of liquid&#8208;metal electrodes encased in a hydrogel. Deforming the device by &#8776;25% strain generates a power density &#8776;0.5&#160;mW&#160;m&#8722;2. This unconventional approach is attractive because: (1) it does not need an external voltage supply to provide charge; (2) the electrodes themselves deform; and (3) it can work under various modes of deformation such as pressing, stretching, bending, and twisting. The unique ability of the harvester to operate underwater shows promising applications in wearables that contact sweat, underwater sensing, and blue energy harvesting.

         <title>Carbon Nanotube&#8211;Hydrogel Composites Facilitate Neuronal Differentiation While Maintaining Homeostasis of Network Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new, versatile method for the preparation of carbon nanotube&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel composites is developed. The effects of the composites on neuronal differentiation and activity of pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, adult neural stem cells, and primary hippocampal neurons are investigated. It is demonstrated that the composites can serve as effective scaffolds promoting neuronal differentiation while maintaining network activity homeostasis.








Abstract
It is often assumed that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stimulate neuronal differentiation by transferring electrical signals and enhancing neuronal excitability. Given this, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are regarded as potential materials able to combine high electrical conductivity with biocompatibility, and therefore promote nerve regeneration. However, whether CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites actually influence neuronal differentiation and maturation, and how they do so remain elusive. In this study, CNT&#8211;hydrogel composites are prepared by in situ polymerization of poly(ethylene glycol) around a preformed CNT meshwork. It is demonstrated that the composites facilitate long&#8208;term survival and differentiation of pheochromocytoma 12 cells. Adult neural stem cells cultured on the composites show an increased neuron&#8208;to&#8208;astrocyte ratio and higher synaptic connectivity. Moreover, primary hippocampal neurons cultured on composites maintain morphological synaptic features as well as their neuronal network activity evaluated by spontaneous calcium oscillations, which are comparable to neurons cultured under control conditions. These results indicate that the composites are promising materials that could indeed facilitate neuronal differentiation while maintaining neuronal homeostasis.

         <title>Designing New&#8208;Generation Piezoelectric Transducers by Embedding Superior Graphene&#8208;Based Thermal Regulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels are constructed via synthesizing a brand&#8208;new chemical&#8208;vapor&#8208;deposition&#8208;derived 3D/2D graphene homojunction on an AlN&#8208;thermosensitive&#8208;ceramic template. New&#8208;generation cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers are designed and constructed via embedding the 3D/2D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based thermal regulators, which can simultaneously uniformize, transmit, and release heat. The self&#8208;heating&#8208;caused temperature rise is substantially reduced by &#8776;60%, along with dramatically enhanced electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and amplitude.








Abstract
Cascaded&#8208;piezoelectric&#8208;transducers (CPETs) is a key component in modern energy&#8208;conversion fields, possessing versatile applications in ultrasonic scalpels, acoustic levitation, and sonar. However, serious self&#8208;heating inevitably occurs inside high&#8208;power CPETs, severely limiting their practical applications in broader fields. To tackle this, multidirectional heat&#8208;escape channels of multidimensional (multi&#8208;D, 3D/2D) graphene films are introduced in designing new&#8208;type thermal regulators. A porous AlN&#8208;ceramic thermal&#8208;sink is creatively selected as a template for directly synthesizing graphene via a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition strategy. This perfect combination of 3D/2D&#8208;graphene and the AlN ceramic can integrate their complementary advantages in uniformizing, transmitting, and releasing heat. Amazingly, in the new&#8208;generation CPETs embedded with these graphene&#8208;based thermal regulators, the self&#8208;heating&#8208;induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by &#8776;60% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic&#8208;energy&#8208;conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new&#8208;generation CPETs. Briefly, this research realizes the first synthesis of a novel multi&#8208;D&#8208;graphene/AlN&#8208;ceramic hybrid, and propels its brand&#8208;new application directions in new&#8208;generation energy&#8208;conversion&#8208; and thermal&#8208;management&#8208;related territories.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cascaded-piezoelectric-transducers (CPETs) is a key component in modern energy-conversion fields, possessing versatile applications in ultrasonic scalpels, acoustic levitation, and sonar. However, serious self-heating inevitably occurs inside high-power CPETs, severely limiting their practical applications in broader fields. To tackle this, multidirectional heat-escape channels of multidimensional (multi-D, 3D/2D) graphene films are introduced in designing new-type thermal regulators. A porous AlN-ceramic thermal-sink is creatively selected as a template for directly synthesizing graphene via a two-step chemical vapor deposition strategy. This perfect combination of 3D/2D-graphene and the AlN ceramic can integrate their complementary advantages in uniformizing, transmitting, and releasing heat. Amazingly, in the new-generation CPETs embedded with these graphene-based thermal regulators, the self-heating-induced temperature rise can be substantially reduced by &#8776;60% (far exceeding actual demand standard). As another kernel parameter, electroacoustic-energy-conversion efficiency is dramatically improved in the new-generation CPETs. Briefly, this research realizes the first synthesis of a novel multi-D-graphene/AlN-ceramic hybrid, and propels its brand-new application directions in new-generation energy-conversion- and thermal-management-related territories.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Thermopower of Saturated Molecules by Noncovalent Anchor&#8208;Induced Electron Doping of Single&#8208;Layer Graphene Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saturated molecules are not preferred in the research of organic thermoelectrics because of intrinsically wide bandgaps and poor thermopower. Graphene electrodes are demonstrated to be able to enhance thermopower of monolayers of saturated compounds. A noncovalent amine anchor induces the creation of in&#8208;gap states and n&#8208;type doping of graphene, thereby leading to an increased Seebeck coefficient relative to analogous covalent gold&#8211;thiolate monolayers.








Abstract
Enhancing thermopower is a key goal in organic and molecular thermoelectrics. Herein, it is shown that introducing noncovalent contact with a single&#8208;layer graphene (SLG) electrode improves the thermopower of saturated molecules as compared to the traditional gold&#8211;thiolate covalent contact. Thermoelectric junction measurements with a liquid&#8208;metal technique reveal that the value of Seebeck coefficient in large&#8208;area junctions based on n&#8208;alkylamine self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on SLG is increased up to fivefold compared to the analogous junction based on n&#8208;alkanethiolate SAMs on gold. Experiments with Raman spectroscopy and field&#8208;effect transistor analysis indicate that such enhancements benefit from the creation of new in&#8208;gap states and electron doping through noncovalent interaction between the amine anchor and the SLG electrode, which leads to a reduced energy offset between the Fermi level and the transport channel. This work demonstrates that control of interfacial bonding nature in molecular junctions improves the Seebeck effect in saturated molecules.

         <title>An Injectable Meta&#8208;Biomaterial: From Design and Simulation to In Vivo Shaping and Tissue induction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metamaterials gain unusual properties through their microstructure rather than specific chemistry. An elastic, porous, and injectable (EPI) microscaffold metamaterial is simulated and designed. The EPI provides experimental proof to the conjecture of elastic strain softening in microgel suspensions. Initially shapeable, it dynamically matches the local tissue mechanics, and templates long&#8208;term soft tissue colonization and vascularization.








Abstract
A novel type of injectable biomaterial with an elastic softening transition is described. The material enables in&#160;vivo shaping, followed by induction of 3D stable vascularized tissue. The synthesis of the injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial is instructed by extensive numerical simulation as a suspension of irregularly fragmented, highly porous sponge&#8208;like microgels. The irregular particle shape dramatically enhances yield strain for in&#160;vivo stability against deformation. Porosity of the particles, along with friction between internal surfaces, provides the elastic softening transition. This emergent metamaterial property enables the material to reversibly change stiffness during deformation, allowing native tissue properties to be matched over a wide range of deformation amplitudes. After subcutaneous injection in mice, predetermined shapes can be sculpted manually. The 3D shape is maintained during excellent host tissue integration, with induction of vascular connective tissue that persists to the end of one&#8208;year follow&#8208;up. The geometrical design is compatible with many hydrogel materials, including cell&#8208;adhesion motives for cell transplantation. The injectable meta&#8208;biomaterial therefore provides new perspectives in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

         <title>Video Speed Switching of Plasmonic Structural Colors with High Contrast and Superior Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic paper technologies are essential for reducing the energy consumption in future display devices. The first example of video speed switching of structural colors over the whole visible region is shown, while retaining high contrast. This is achieved with polarization&#8208;insensitive metasurfaces and conjugated polymers, not liquid crystals. The lifetime is shown to be over ten million cycles.








Abstract
Reflective displays or &#8220;electronic paper&#8221; technologies provide a solution to the high energy consumption of emissive displays by simply utilizing ambient light. However, it has proven challenging to develop electronic paper with competitive image quality and video speed capabilities. Here, the first technology that provides video speed switching of structural colors with high contrast over the whole visible is shown. Importantly, this is achieved with a&#160;broadband&#8208;absorbing polarization&#8208;insensitive electrochromic polymer instead of liquid crystals, which makes it possible to maintain high reflectivity. It is shown that promoting electrophoretic ion transport (drift motion) improves the switch speed. In combination with new nanostructures that have high surface curvature, this enables video speed switching (20&#160;ms) at high contrast (50% reflectivity change). A detailed analysis of the optical signal during switching shows that the polaron formation starts to obey first order reaction kinetics in the video speed regime. Additionally, the system still operates at ultralow power consumption during video speed switching (&lt;1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and has negligible power consumption (&lt;1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) in bistability mode. Finally, the fast switching increases device lifetime to at least 107 cycles, an order of magnitude more than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Quantum Confinement in CVD 2D WS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatically defined quantum confinement in large&#8208;area chemical vapor deposition&#8208;grown 2D WS2 with HfO2 dielectrics grown by atomic layer deposition is reported. This marks a key milestone in scalable approaches toward 2D&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based quantum devices, which has hitherto only been demonstrated with micrometer&#8208;sized exfoliated flakes. The measurements show that low&#8208;temperature carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but is due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness.








Abstract
Temperature&#8208;dependent transport measurements are&#160;performed on the same set of chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#8208;grown WS2 single&#8208; and bilayer devices before and after atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2. This isolates the influence of HfO2 deposition on low&#8208;temperature carrier transport and shows that carrier mobility is not charge impurity limited as commonly thought, but due to another important but commonly overlooked factor: interface roughness. This finding is corroborated by circular dichroic photoluminescence spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray photoemission spectroscopy, cross&#8208;sectional scanning transmission electron microscopy, carrier&#8208;transport modeling, and density functional modeling. Finally, electrostatic gate&#8208;defined quantum confinement is demonstrated using a scalable approach of large&#8208;area CVD&#8208;grown bilayer WS2 and ALD&#8208;grown HfO2. The high dielectric constant and low leakage current enabled by HfO2 allows an estimated quantum dot size as small as 58 nm. The ability to lithographically define increasingly smaller devices is especially important for transition metal dichalcogenides due to their large effective masses, and should pave the way toward their use in quantum information processing applications.

         <title>High Antibacterial Activity and Selectivity of the Versatile Polysulfoniums that Combat Drug Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of polypeptoid sulfoniums prepared by ring&#8208;opening polymerization and post&#8208;polymerization functionalization exhibit high selectivity and potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacy with negligible antibacterial resistance. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms.








Abstract
Sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;containing polymers exhibit significant potential benefits for various applications. An efficient strategy to synthesize a type of antibacterial sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing polypeptoids via a combination of ring&#8208;opening polymerization and a post&#8208;polymerization functionalization with various functional epoxides is presented. A systematic investigation is further performed in order to explore the influence of the overall hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity and selectivity of the prepared polysulfoniums. Notably, those chlorepoxypropane&#8208;modified polysulfoniums with an optimized amphiphilic balance show higher selectivity toward both Gram&#8208;negative Escherichia coli and Gram&#8208;positive Staphylococcus aureus, than to red blood cells.

&lt;p&gt;A novel type of polypeptoid sulfoniums prepared by ring-opening polymerization and post-polymerization functionalization exhibit high selectivity and potent in vitro and in vivo antibacterial efficacy with negligible antibacterial resistance. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sulfonium-ion-containing polymers exhibit significant potential benefits for various applications. An efficient strategy to synthesize a type of antibacterial sulfonium-ion-bearing polypeptoids via a combination of ring-opening polymerization and a post-polymerization functionalization with various functional epoxides is presented. A systematic investigation is further performed in order to explore the influence of the overall hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance on the antimicrobial activity and selectivity of the prepared polysulfoniums. Notably, those chlorepoxypropane-modified polysulfoniums with an optimized amphiphilic balance show higher selectivity toward both Gram-negative &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and Gram-positive &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, than to red blood cells. The polymers also show great efficiency in inhibiting &lt;i&gt;S. aureus&lt;/i&gt; biofilm formations, as well as in further eradicating the mature biofilms. Remarkably, negligible antibacterial resistance and cross-resistance to commercial antibiotics is shown in these polymers. The polysulfoniums further show their potent in vivo antimicrobial efficacy in a multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; infection model that is developed on mouse skin. Similar to the antimicrobial peptides, the polysulfoniums are demonstrated to kill bacteria through membrane disruption. The obtained polypeptoid sulfoniums, with high selectivity and potent antibacterial property, are excellent candidates for antibacterial treatment and open up new possibilities for the preparation of a class of innovative antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation of the Green Mussel Adhesive Protein Pvfp&#8208;5 is Regulated by the Post&#8208;Translated Dopa Amino Acid</title>

The underwater adhesive prowess of mussels is well&#8208;known to be linked to the post&#8208;translated amino acid l&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) present in high abundance in mussel adhesive proteins. Dopa is shown to play another important role in green mussel adhesive threads: it regulates liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of the adhesive protein Pvfp&#8208;5, enabling biofabrication of the adhesive thread under an immersed environment.








Abstract
The underwater adhesive prowess of aquatic mussels has been largely attributed to the abundant post&#8208;translationally modified amino acid l&#8208;3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenylalanine (Dopa) in mussel foot proteins (MFPs) that make up their adhesive threads. More recently, it has been suggested that during thread fabrication, MFPs form intermediate fluidic phases such as liquid crystals or coacervates regulated by a liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) process. Here, it is shown that Dopa plays another central role during mussel fiber formation, by enabling LLPS of Pvfp&#8208;5&#946;, a main MFP of the green mussel Perna viridis. Using residue&#8208;specific substitution of Tyrosine (Tyr) for Dopa during recombinant expression, Dopa&#8208;substituted Pvfp&#8208;5&#946; is shown to exhibit LLPS under seawater&#8208;like conditions, whereas the Tyr&#8208;only version forms insoluble aggregates. Combining quantum chemistry calculations and solution NMR, a transient H&#8208;bonding network requiring the two hydroxyl groups of Dopa is found to be critical to enable LLPS in Dopa&#8208;mutated Pvfp&#8208;5&#946;. Overall, the study suggests that Dopa plays an important role in regulating LLPS of MFPs, which may be critical to concentrate the adhesive proteins at the plaque/substrate interface and therefore produce a more robust adhesive. The findings also provide molecular&#8208;level lessons to guide biomanufacturing of protein&#8208;based materials such as bioadhesives and load&#8208;bearing fibers.
