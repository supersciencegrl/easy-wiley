         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

Abstract
The demand for accurate vascular simulators is increasing to facilitate effective clinical studies on cardiovascular diseases.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Additive Strategy for Enhanced Material and Device Stability in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this report, the internal strain affecting the stability of FAPbI3 perovskite is addressed through the design of additives in the precursor solution. Instead of conventional methylammonium chloride, a triple&#8208;additive approach is employed, leading to improved phase stability and reduced strain gradient. The strategy results in enhanced durability and efficiency, with power conversion efficiency retention of 95% after 8000 h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 condition and a maximum PCE of 24.50%.








Abstract
The stability of the FAPbI3 perovskite phase is significantly affected by internal strain. In this report, additives in the perovskite precursor solution are designed to prevent local lattice mismatch of the resulting perovskite layer. Instead of using a conventional methylammonium chloride (Control), triple additives (Target) are introduced by considering ion association and formation energy. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation for the (100) plane is less pronounced by the triple additives compared to the Control film with a highly enhanced preferred orientation, which reduces the strain gradient and the Pb&#9472;I bond distance. Moreover, the anisotropic atomic&#8208;level lattice strain along (111) plane, associated with the &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; phase transition, is more uniformly distributed by the triple additives. The triple&#8208;additive strategy demonstrates exceptional phase stability under relative humidity as high as 90% and the International Summit on Organic Photovoltaic Stability (ISOS)&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol. The device lifetime measured under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1 condition shows that the Target perovskite solar cell (PSC) maintains 95% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for over 8000&#160;h, and the best PCE of 24.50% is achieved.

         <title>Glassy Thermal Transport Triggers Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability induced confined phonon mean free path leading to glass&#8208;like thermal transport, and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in BiSe, Pb co&#8208;doped GeTe.








Abstract
The consequences of broken long&#8208;range atomic arrangement in glasses or amorphous solids are reflected in the temperature dependence of lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat). However, the appearance of glassy ultralow &#954;lat in a crystalline solid with high electrical transport like metal is unusual but can have a remarkable impact on the thermoelectric performance of a material. Here, an ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance is demonstrated with a maximum figure of merit, zT &#8776; 2.7 (&#8776;2.92 with Dulong&#8211;Petit heat capacity) via achieving glassy thermal transport along with significant electrical conductivity in ball milled BiSe, Pb co&#8208;doped polycrystalline Ge1.03Te followed by spark plasma sintering. The glassy thermal transport results from the inhomogeneous ferroelectric instability developed due to local polar distortions near the dopant sites, which interacts with soft polar optical modes via strain fluctuations. Resulting structural degeneracy and associated soft vibrations sink heat effectively from acoustic phonons, which along with various nanoscale defects, confine the phonon mean free path (MFP) close to the interatomic distance, rendering the thermal transport glassy. However, the material still maintains a high electrical conductivity at ambient condition due to much longer MFP of the charge carriers. A promising output power density of &#8776;0.8&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 for &#916;T &#8776;441 K in double&#8208;leg thermoelectric device demonstrate the potential of this material for mid&#8208;temperature thermoelectric applications.

         <title>Waveguide Microactuators Self&#8208;Rolled Around an Optical Fiber Taper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;rolling integration strategy mounts ultrathin (&#8776;2&#160;&#181;m) poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)/Au microactuators onto optical fiber tapers, achieving unprecedented bending angles (&gt;800&#176;) and rapid response (&#8776;0.55&#160;s). This waveguide microactuator enables dynamic capture of fast&#8208;moving microorganisms and provides a high&#8208;performance, versatile platform for biomedical applications in confined, unstructured environments.








Abstract
Precisely capturing and manipulating microscale objects, such as individual cells and microorganisms, is fundamental to advancements in biomedical research and microrobotics. Photoactuators based on optical fibers serving as flexible, unobstructed waveguides are well&#8208;suited for these operations, particularly in confined locations where free&#8208;space illumination is impractical.

&lt;p&gt;A novel self-rolling integration strategy mounts ultrathin (&#8776;2&#160;&#181;m) poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/Au microactuators onto optical fiber tapers, achieving unprecedented bending angles (&amp;gt;800&#176;) and rapid response (&#8776;0.55&#160;s). This waveguide microactuator enables dynamic capture of fast-moving microorganisms and provides a high-performance, versatile platform for biomedical applications in confined, unstructured environments.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precisely capturing and manipulating microscale objects, such as individual cells and microorganisms, is fundamental to advancements in biomedical research and microrobotics. Photoactuators based on optical fibers serving as flexible, unobstructed waveguides are well-suited for these operations, particularly in confined locations where free-space illumination is impractical. However, integrating optical fibers with microscale actuators poses significant challenges due to size mismatch, resulting in slow responses inadequate for handling motile micro-objects. This study designs microactuators based on hydrogel/Au bilayer heterostructures that self-roll around a tapered optical fiber. This self-rolling mechanism enables the use of thin hydrogel layers only a few micrometers thick, which rapidly absorb and release water molecules during a phase transition. The resulting microactuators exhibit low bending stiffness and extremely fast responses, achieving large bending angles exceeding 800&#176; within 0.55 s. Using this technique, this study successfully captures rapidly swimming Chlamydomonas and Paramecium, and demonstrates programmable non-reciprocal motion for effective non-contact manipulation of yeast cells. This approach provides a versatile platform for microscale manipulations and holds promise for advanced biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Cryo&#8208;Shocked Tumor&#8208;Reprogrammed Sonosensitive Antigen&#8208;Presenting Cells Improving Sonoimmunotherapy via T Cells and NK Cells Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dead APC&#8208;4T1&#8208;N3&#8208;LipoH (DPNL) is constructed via clicking reprogrammed APC like&#8208;4T1 cells with liposome encapsulating HMME (LHs). Sonosensitive DPNL cells effectively target tumor sites and tumor draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). Upon ultrasound, DPNL cells could co&#8208;stimulate the antigen&#8208;presenting program and strikingly elicit antigen&#8208;specific T cell&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity in TDLNs as well as MHC&#8208;I unrestricted NK cell&#8208;mediated innate immunity within tumors for comprehensive sonoimmunotherapy for triple negative breast cancers.








Abstract
Ultrasound therapy has turned up as a noninvasive multifunctional tool for cancer immunotherapy. However, the insufficient co&#8208;stimulating molecules and loss of peptide&#8208;major histocompatibility complex I (MHC&#8208;I) expression on tumor cells lead to poor therapy of sonoimmunotherapies. Herein, this work develops a sonosensitive system to augment MHC&#8208;I unrestricted natural killer (NK) cell&#8208;mediated innate immunity and T cell&#8208;mediated adaptive immunity by leveraging antigen presentation cell (APC)&#8208;like tumor cells. Genetically engineered tumor cells featuring sufficient co&#8208;stimulating molecules are cryo&#8208;shocked and conjugated with a sonosensitizer, hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether, using click chemistry. These cells (DPNLs) exhibit characteristics of tumor and draining lymph node homing. Under ultrasound, NK cell&#8208;mediated innate immunity within the tumor microenvironment could be activated, and T cells in the tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are stimulated through co&#8208;stimulatory molecules. In combination with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody, DPNLs extend the survival time and inhibited lung metastasis in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC) models. This study provides an alternative approach for sonoimmunotherapy with precise sonosensitizer delivery and enhanced NK cell and T cell activation.

         <title>DNA&#8208;Capturing Manganese&#8208;Coordinated Chitosan Microparticles Potentiate Radiotherapy via Activating the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway and Maintaining Tumor&#8208;Infiltrating CD8+ T&#8208;Cell Stemness</title>

         <dc:description>
DNA&#8208;capturing CS&#8208;Mn microparticles are prepared to potentiate radioimmunotherapy. Upon injection into the tumors after X&#8208;ray irradiation, they undergo rapid dissociation to release chitosan which assembles with the extracellular DNA fragments released from the dead cancer cells to in situ form CS&#8208;DNA complexes and synergize with Mn2+ to stimulate DC maturation via activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway for enhanced CD8+ T&#8208;cell stemness.








Abstract
The radiotherapy&#8208;induced release of DNA fragments can stimulate the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway to prime antitumor immunity, but this pathway is expected to be less potent because of the inefficient cytosolic delivery of negatively charged DNA fragments. In this study, manganese&#8208;coordinated chitosan (CS&#8208;Mn) microparticles with selective DNA&#8208;capturing capacity are concisely prepared via a coordination&#8208;directed one&#8208;pot synthesis process to potentiate the immunogenicity of radiotherapy. The obtained CS&#8208;Mn microparticles that undergo rapid disassembly under physiological conditions can selectively bind with DNA to form positively charged DNA&#8208;CS assemblies because of the strong electrostatic interaction between linear chitosan and DNA molecules. They thus enable efficient cytosolic delivery of DNA in the presence of serum to cooperate with Mn2+ to activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway in dendritic cells. Upon intratumoral injection, the CS&#8208;Mn microparticles markedly enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy against both irradiated and distal tumors in different tumor models via collectively promoting tumor&#8208;infiltrating CD8+ T&#8208;cell stemness and the activation of innate immunity. The radiosensitization effect of CS&#8208;Mn microparticles can be further augmented by concurrently applying anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein 1 (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1) immunotherapy. This work highlights an ingenious strategy to prepare Trojan horse&#8208;like DNA&#8208;capturing microparticles as cGAS&#8208;STING&#8208;activating radiosensitizers for effective radioimmunotherapy.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Gallium Oxide Solar&#8208;Blind Photodetector with Novel Thermal Pulse Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ga2O3 solar&#8208;blind photodetector with a vertically stratified crystalline structure and VO&#160;concentration is designed to spatially separate the carrier's generation and transport channels in the device, thus achieving excellent responsivity and response speed simultaneously.








Abstract
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) emerges as a promising solar&#8208;blind photodetector (SBPD) material if the &#8220;Response Speed (RS) dilemma&#8221; can be resolved. Devices with spatially segregated carrier generation and transport channels offer a potential solution but remain less available. This work introduces a novel thermal pulse treatment (TPT) method to achieve a vertically stratified crystalline structure and oxygen vacancies (VO) throughout the Ga2O3 film, validated through extensive characterizations. Technology Computer&#8208;Aided Design (TCAD) simulations corroborated the critical role of VO stratification in enhancing the responsivity (R&#955;) and response speed simultaneously. Consequently, the TPT&#8208;processed SBPD exhibited exceptional performance, boasting a maximum &#160;R&#955; of 312.6 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a faster decay time of 40 &#181;s, respectively. Moreover, the corresponding SBPD chips show significant potential for applications in solar&#8208;blind imaging, light trajectory tracking, and solar&#8208;blind power meters. This work thus provides a viable strategy to address the &#8220;RS dilemma&#8221; common in most wide&#8208;bandgap materials, showcasing excellent application value.

         <title>Perturbing Organelle&#8208;Level K+/Ca2+ Homeostasis by Nanotherapeutics for Enhancing Ion&#8208;Mediated Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle&#8208;level, which can effectively evoke tumor&#8208;associated immunogenicity, thereby stimulating the activation of DCs and potentiating the infiltration of tumor&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells to achieve high&#8208;performance cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Intracellular ions are involved in numerous pivotal immune processes, but the precise regulation of these signaling ions to achieve innovative immune therapeutic strategies is still a huge challenge. Here, an ion&#8208;mediated immunotherapy agent (IMIA) is engineered to achieve precise spatiotemporal control of perturbing K+/Ca2+ homeostasis at the organelle&#8208;level, thereby amplifying antitumor immune responses to achieve high&#8208;performance cancer therapy. By taking in intracellular K+ and supplying exogenous Ca2+ within tumor cells, K+/Ca2+ homeostasis is perturbed by IMIA. In parallel, perturbing K+ homeostasis induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the release of Ca2+ from ER and causes a decreased concentration of Ca2+ in ER, which further accelerates ER&#8208;mitochondria Ca2+ flux and the influx of extracellular Ca2+ (store&#8208;operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)) via opening Ca2+ release&#8208;activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, thus creating a self&#8208;amplifying ion interference loop to perturb K+/Ca2+ homeostasis. In this process, the elevated immunogenicity of tumor cells would evoke robust antitumor immune responses by driving the excretion of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Importantly, this ion&#8208;immunotherapy strategy reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and awakens the systemic immune response and long&#8208;term immune memory effect, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of primary/distant tumors, orthotopic tumors as well as metastatic tumors in different mice models.

By taking in intracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and supplying exogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within tumor cells, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis is perturbed by IMIA. In parallel, perturbing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers the release of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from ER and causes a decreased concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in ER, which further accelerates ER-mitochondria Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and the influx of extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE)) via opening Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (CRAC) channels, thus creating a self-amplifying ion interference loop to perturb K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis. In this process, the elevated immunogenicity of tumor cells would evoke robust antitumor immune responses by driving the excretion of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Importantly, this ion-immunotherapy strategy reshapes the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME), and awakens the systemic immune response and long-term immune memory effect, thus effectively inhibiting the growth of primary/distant tumors, orthotopic tumors as well as metastatic tumors in different mice models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>All&#8208;Climate Energy&#8208;Dense Cascade Aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 Batteries Enabled by a Polycationic Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 batteries is seriously restricted by their low energy density and poor temperature tolerance. Herein, a temperature&#8208;insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax&#8208;bacterial cellulose / p(AM&#8208;co&#8208;VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) is designed to realize an energy&#8208;dense Zn&#8208;I2 battery with cascade I0/I&#8722;, I+/I0, and Br0/Br&#8722; redox couples over a widen temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The practical development of aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#8208;I2) batteries is greatly hindered by the low energy density resulting from conventional I0/I&#8722; conversion and the limited temperature tolerance. Here, a temperature&#8208;insensitive polycationic hydrogel electrolyte borax&#8208;bacterial cellulose / p(AM&#8208;co&#8208;VBIMBr) (denoted as BAVBr) for achieving an energy&#8208;dense cascade aqueous Zn&#8208;I2 battery over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C is designed. A comprehensive investigation, combining advanced spectroscopic investigation and DFT calculations, has revealed that the presence of Br species in the gel electrolyte facilitates the conversion reaction of Br0/Br&#8722;. Simultaneously, it activates the high voltage I+/I0 redox reaction through interhalogen formation. Consequently, sequential and highly reversible redox reactions involving I0/I&#8722;, I+/I0, and Br0/Br&#8722; are achieved with the assistance of &#8722;NR3+ units in BAVBr, effectively suppressing interhalogen hydrolysis in aqueous electrolyte. The cascade reactions lead to a high area capacity of 0.76 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a low I2 loading of 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 or 760 mAh g&#8722;1 based on the mass of iodine, demonstrating exceptional long&#8208;term cycling stability over a wide temperature range from &#8722;50 to 50&#160;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for high&#8208;energy aqueous batteries, specifically tailored for wide&#8208;temperature operation.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD&#8208;L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD&#8208;L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 inhibits intracellular PD&#8208;L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage but also maximizing T&#8208;cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B&#8208;containing polymer that self&#8208;assembled with PD&#8208;L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD&#8208;L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD&#8208;L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T&#8208;cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Neural Network&#8208;Assisted End&#8208;to&#8208;End Design for Full Light Field Control of Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive system&#8208;level neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework of meta&#8208;optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non&#8208;orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing.








Abstract
Meta&#8208;optics, with unique light&#8208;matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi&#8208;parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano&#8208;structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high&#8208;performance full&#8208;light field control. Here, a neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework that facilitates global, gradient&#8208;based optimization of multifunctional meta&#8208;optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., &#8776;6 &#215; structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full&#8208;parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non&#8208;orthogonal polarizations (&gt;3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta&#8208;optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent optical technologies.

The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta-optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next-generation intelligent optical technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Record Efficiency of &#946;&#8208;Phase PVDF&#8208;MXene Composites in Thin&#8208;Film Dielectric Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXenes are delaminated in a green organic solvent to achieve large flake size and polymer compatibility. PVDF composites are produced through non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation to tune the structure and properties of thin&#8208;film dielectric capacitors. MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations enhance the&#160;dielectric properties of PVDF, reaching energy density above 45 J cm&#8722;3 and 95% efficiency.








Abstract
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a semicrystalline polymer used in thin&#8208;film dielectric capacitors because of its inherently high dielectric constant and low loss tangent. Its dielectric constant can be increased by the formation and alignment of its &#946;&#8208;phase crystalline structure, which can be facilitated by 2D nanofillers. 2D carbides and nitrides, MXenes, are promising candidates due to their notable dielectric permittivity and ability to increase interfacial polarization. Still, their mixing is challenging due to weak interfacial interactions and poor dispersibility of MXenes in PVDF. This work explores a novel method for delaminating Ti3C2Tx MXene directly into organic solvents while maintaining flake size and quality, as well as the use of a non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation method for producing both dense and porous PVDF&#8208;MXene composite films. A deeper understanding of dielectric behavior in these composites is reached by examining MXenes with both mixed and pure chlorine terminations in PVDF matrices. Thin&#8208;film capacitors fabricated from these composites display ultrahigh discharge energy density, exceeding 45 J cm&#8722;3 with 95% efficiency. The PVDF&#8208;MXene composites are also processed using a green and sustainable solvent, propylene carbonate.

         <title>Self&#8208;Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient&#8208;Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self&#8208;manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non&#8208;invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in&#160;ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self&#8208;manipulating sodium ion gradient&#8208;based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig&#8208;EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non&#8208;invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig&#8208;EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig&#8208;EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+&#8208;ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig&#8208;EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury&#8208;associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig&#8208;EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Polarization Convolution Based on Ferroelectric&#8208;Reconfigurable Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in&#8208;sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire&#8208;induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two&#8208;order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization&#8208;based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in&#8208;sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in&#8208;sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric&#8208;reconfigurable polarization&#8208;sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in&#8208;sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non&#8208;volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road&#8208;scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

         <title>Molecular Trojan Based on Membrane&#8208;Mimicking Conjugated Electrolyte for Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Drug Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional &#8220;Trojan&#8221; molecule based on membrane&#8208;mimicking and zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte is developed for advanced drug delivery systems. By integrating into and rigidifying lipid bilayer structures, it prevents premature payload leakage and enables reliable in vivo visualization of carriers. Upon remote 808&#160;nm excitation, this light&#8208;responsive molecule triggers rapid drug release at tumor sites, inducing synergistic multimodal therapies.








Abstract
Enhancing payload encapsulation stability while enabling controlled drug release are both critical objectives in drug delivery systems but are challenging to reconcile. This study introduces a zwitterionic conjugated electrolyte (CE) molecule named Zwit, which acts as a molecular Trojan by mimicking the lipid bilayers. When integrated into liposome membranes, Zwit rigidifies the bilayer structure likely due to its hydrophobic interactions providing structural support, thus inhibiting drug leakage. Upon 808&#160;nm laser excitation, Zwit rapidly accelerates DOX release from liposome core, likely due to light&#8208;triggered conformational changes or photothermal effects that compromise membrane permeability. These findings demonstrate Zwit&#8217;s ability to overcome the challenge of simultaneously preventing premature payload leakage and enabling stimuli&#8208;responsive drug release with a single component. Additionally, Zwit exhibits excellent biocompatibility with membranes, outperforming its quaternary ammonium counterpart and commonly used dye indocyanine green (ICG). By harnessing its NIR&#8208;II emission, Zwit enables durable in vivo biodistribution tracking of nanocarriers, whereas ICG suffers from significant dye leakage. In subcutaneous tumor models, the synergistic effects of chemotherapy and thermotherapy facilitated by this light&#8208;triggered system induced a potent antitumor immune response, further enhancing anticancer efficacy. This work underscores the potential of membrane&#8208;mimicking CEs as multifunctional tools in advanced drug delivery systems.

         <title>A Universal Thick Anode for Aqueous and Seawater Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal thick anode composed of polymer and carbon nanotubes has been developed, demonstrating stable operation across 15 simple&#8208;ion and 3 complex&#8208;ion systems. It achieves exceptional cycle life in supercapacitors, ultrahigh areal capacities in batteries, and high compatibility with seawater electrolytes. With ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (100 mg cm&#8315;2) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, this thick electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.









Abstract
Aqueous and seawater energy storage devices hold great potential for electrical grids application due to safety, affordability, and sustainability. However, their broader deployment has been constrained by the absence of a durable thick anode. Here, the first universal thick anode operating stably across 15 simple&#8208;ion and 3 complex&#8208;ion systems, including nonmetallic (H+, NH4

Composed of polymer nanosheets and carbon nanotubes, this anode supports thick electrode fabrication (e.g., 100&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mm) with low porosity/tortuosity, superior electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and chemical stability.

&lt;p&gt;A universal thick anode composed of polymer and carbon nanotubes has been developed, demonstrating stable operation across 15 simple-ion and 3 complex-ion systems. It achieves exceptional cycle life in supercapacitors, ultrahigh areal capacities in batteries, and high compatibility with seawater electrolytes. With ultrahigh-loading capability (100 mg cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and cost-effectiveness, this thick electrode is promising for practical aqueous (seawater) energy devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous and seawater energy storage devices hold great potential for electrical grids application due to safety, affordability, and sustainability. However, their broader deployment has been constrained by the absence of a durable thick anode. Here, the first universal thick anode operating stably across 15 simple-ion and 3 complex-ion systems, including nonmetallic (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), monovalent (Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), multivalent ions (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;), and seawater ions (&amp;gt;5 cations) is reported. Composed of polymer nanosheets and carbon nanotubes, this anode supports thick electrode fabrication (e.g., 100&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 1&#160;mm) with low porosity/tortuosity, superior electrical conductivity, mechanical robustness, and chemical stability.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr3Te4/WS2/Fe3GeTe2/WTe2 Magnetic Memory with Field&#8208;Free Switching and Low Power Consumption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance&#8208;area product by integrating chemically vapor&#8208;deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin&#8208;orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high&#8208;performance spintronics but also paves the way for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field&#8208;free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT&#8208;memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor&#8208;deposited two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non&#8208;volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance&#8208;area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low&#8208;power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti&#8208;parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT&#8208;memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT&#8208;memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT&#8208;memory with PMA field&#8208;free switching.

         <title>Glucose Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Poly(amino acid) Nanoformulation of Oxaliplatin(IV)&#8208;Aspirin Prodrug for Enhanced Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose metabolism&#8208;targeted nanoformulation (NP/OXA&#8208;ASP2) is designed to inhibit lactate efflux while inducing mitochondrial stress to boost immunogenic cell death, thus synergistically reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments by decreasing the proportion of immunosuppressive cells (Tregs and MDSCs) and increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and plays an enhanced efficacy of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy to colon cancer.








Abstract
Inappropriate glucose metabolism in cancer cells is associated with immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Although glycolysis inhibition enhances T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses, the integrated platforms combining glycolysis inhibition with immunotherapy remain underdeveloped. To address this gap, a glucose metabolism&#8208;targeted poly(amino acid) nanoformulation of oxaliplatin(IV)&#8208;aspirin prodrug (NP/OXA&#8208;ASP2) is developed to improve chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by suppressing tumor glycolysis. This poly(amino acid) nanoparticle exhibits selective release, discharging 90.0% of OXA&#8208;ASP2 under reductive conditions within 36 h. Furthermore, over 80% of the prodrug converts to OXA and ASP within 12 h, promoting mitochondrial damage and glycolysis inhibition, which amplifies immunogenic cell death induced by OXA. In addition, suppressing glycolytic flux reduces lactate leakage, mitigating the immunosuppressive TMEs. Together, these mechanisms contribute to stronger chemo&#8208;immunotherapy efficacy. Compared to the OXA plus ASP formulation, NP/OXA&#8208;ASP2 demonstrates superior performances, reducing lactate levels at the tumor site by 25.4%, increasing the proportion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by 1.53 times, decreasing the proportion of regulatory T cells by 2.20 times, and improving 1.39&#8208;fold of the tumor inhibition rate. These findings underscore that NP/OXA&#8208;ASP2 is a promising platform for integrating tumor metabolic regulation with immunomodulation and holds significant potential for advancing clinical chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeted Glutamine Metabolism Blocker Synergizes with TiO2&#8208;Au Janus Nanoparticles for Enhanced Sono&#8208;Metabolic Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sono&#8208;metabolic nano&#8208;composites (TiO2&#8208;Au@DON) produce huge amounts of ROS (type I and type II) under ultrasound irradiation, effectively inducing immunogenic cell death via TiO2&#8208;Au&#8208;induced&#8208;SDT phenomena. The released DON disrupts NADPH and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress, offering a precise combination of SDT and immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a promising therapeutic modality known for its non&#8208;invasiveness, temporal&#8208;spatial controllability, and deeper tissue penetration. However, the SDT treatment efficacy is still hampered by the scarcity of ideal sonosensitizers and complex tumor microenvironment (TME). To address these challenges, a sono&#8208;metabolic nano&#8208;composite (TiO2&#8208;Au@DON) using the metabolic reprogramming prodrugs of 6&#8208;Diazo&#8208;5&#8208;oxo&#8208;l&#8208;norleucine (DON) grafted on TiO2&#8208;Au Janus nanoparticles (NPs) is fabricated. The coupling of TiO2 and gold in the TiO2&#8208;Au@DON effectively prevents the fast recombination of excited electrons and holes under ultrasound irradiation. The result is the generation of higher levels of both type I and II reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to pure TiO2, which helps overcome the limitations of SDT in the hypoxic TME. Furthermore, the TiO2&#8208;Au Janus NPs act as nano&#8208;carriers, delivering DON prodrugs to the tumor site. The released DON can disrupt nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) and tumor redox homeostasis by reprogramming the metabolic pathways while it intensifies the activities of immune cells. This metabolic disruption amplifies SDT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress, resulting in the increase of tumor sensitivity to ROS through TiO2&#8208;Au@DON&#8208;integrated synergistic effects of SDT and glutamine reprogramming strategies. This increased sensitivity ultimately induces robust immunogenic cell death (ICD), enhancing antitumor therapeutic efficacy and remodeling the tumor's immunosuppressive microenvironment.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced broadband photodetector technologies are essential for military and civilian applications. 2D semimetals, with their gapless band structures, high mobility, and topological protection, offer great promise for broadband PDs. This study reviews the latest advancements in broadband PDs utilizing heterostructures that combine 2D semimetals with materials of various dimensions and highlights their applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Hybrid heterostructures are pivotal in the advanced broadband detection technology. The emergence of 2D semimetals has expanded the range of materials in heterostructures beyond conventional narrow&#8208;gap materials for room&#8208;temperature broadband detection applications due to their extraordinary optical and electrical properties. This review outlines the cutting&#8208;edge and latest advancements in broadband photodetectors (PDs) engineered from heterostructures that synergistically combine 2D semimetals with several different dimensional materials.

         <title>Crossing the Dimensional Divide with Optoelectronic Tweezers: Multicomponent Light&#8208;Driven Micromachines with Motion Transfer in Three Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, multi&#8208;component micromachines are developed that facilitate 3D motion transfer across different planes. These light&#8208;driven 3D micromachines, fabricated using standard photolithography combined with direct laser writing, are assembled and actuated via programmable light patterns within an optoelectronic tweezers system. Utilizing charge&#8208;induced repulsion and dielectrophoretic levitation effects, the micromachines enable highly efficient mechanical rotation and effective inter&#8208;component motion transfer.








Abstract
Micromachines capable of performing diverse mechanical tasks in complex and constrained microenvironments are of great interest. Despite important milestones in this pursuit, until now, micromachines are confined to actuation within a single 2D plane due to the challenges of transferring motion across different planes in limited space. Here, a breakthrough method is presented to overcome this limitation: multi&#8208;component micromachines that facilitate 3D motion transfer across different planes. These light&#8208;driven 3D micromachines, fabricated using standard photolithography combined with direct laser writing, are assembled and actuated via programmable light patterns within an optoelectronic tweezers system. Utilizing charge&#8208;induced repulsion and dielectrophoretic levitation effects, the micromachines enable highly efficient mechanical rotation and effective inter&#8208;component motion transfer. Through this work, fascinating patterns of similarities are unveiled for the new microscale 3D systems when compared with the macro&#8208;scale world in which they live, paving the way for the development of micromechanical devices and microsystems with ever increasing functionality and versatility.

         <title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well&#8208;ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl&#8208;binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high&#8208;affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of &#8776;140 and &#8776;40, respectively, while maintaining long&#8208;term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high&#8208;performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Stress Release of Single Crystal Arrays Bridged by SAM Interface Toward Highly Mechanically Durable Flexible Perovskite NIR Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and stress release of nano&#8208;array structure, presenting the maximum response wavelength of 1050&#160;nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 6.19 &#215; 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra&#8208;long environmental stability.








Abstract
Perovskite photodetectors with superior optoelectronic properties, lightweight, and compatibility with flexible substrates have attracted much attention in wearable electronics. However, the large bandgap, inherent brittleness, poor environmental stability, and weak interfacial adhesion interaction between perovskites and substrates hinder the application of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) wearable devices. Herein, a universal strategy to enhance the performance and mechanical stability of flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays is demonstrated through a combination of mussel&#8208;inspired self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) bridging interface and precise modulation of the nano&#8208;array size, which enables to significantly increase interfacial adhesion, crystallinity, crystallographic orientation, and reduce mechanical stresses of perovskite single&#8208;crystal arrays. Moreover, inserting paddle&#8208;wheel metal&#8211;organic cluster ligands lead to an unprecedented small bandgap of 1.04&#160;eV, enhanced lattice rigidity, and environmental stability for 2D perovskite. The flexible perovskite NIR photodetector arrays with superior mechanical robustness and record NIR performance are revealed with a maximum response wavelength of 1050&#160;nm, a responsivity of 1.66 A W&#8722;1, detectivity of 6.19 &#215; 1012 Jones, high fidelity imaging, and extra&#8208;long environmental stability. This work pioneers a new insight into the integration of high&#8208;performance and mechanically durable perovskite flexible wearable devices.

         <title>Molecularly Functionalized Biomass Hydrogels for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;switching enzyme&#8208;like activity of the hydrogel activated by the hyperglycemia environment induces the opening of the hypoxia&#8208;sensitive microcapsules, regulates the dynamic stability of blood glucose through intelligent insulin delivery. The hydrogel dynamically regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) through self&#8208;switching enzyme&#8208;like activity, produces ROS through peroxidase&#8208;like activity to achieve antibacterial, and promotes infected diabetic wound healing by converting ROS to release oxygen.








Abstract
The defective blood glucose regulation ability of diabetic patients leading to bacterial infection, cellular oxidative stress, and vascular damage results in delayed healing of chronic diabetic wounds. Here, a glucose&#8208;activated self&#8208;switching enzyme&#8208;like activity programmed hydrogel is proposed to provide self&#8208;regulated timely intelligent insulin release affected by blood glucose fluctuations, thereby forming feedback blood glucose management and exerting a full&#8208;stage wound healing. The hydrogel is composed of Au&#9472;MoS2&#9472;phenylboronic acid nanozyme and insulin&#8208;loaded nitroimidazole&#8208;modified sodium alginate hypoxia&#8208;sensitive microcapsules and penylboronic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified chitosan. It utilizes glucose as a sacrificial agent to generate antibacterial reactive oxygen species by recognizing the hyperglycemia environment, and releasing insulin for blood glucose regulation for up to 12 h with the help of the enzyme&#8208;like catalysis&#8208;generated hypoxia environment. In a normoglycemia environment, the hydrogel switches the enzyme&#8208;like activity to supply oxygen, inhibiting further insulin release. The hydrogel achieves &#8776;3 times the wound recovery rate of commercial dressings through blood glucose regulation and improved wound microenvironment. The hydrogel has been proven to significantly improve the healing of chronic diabetic wounds by regulating the body's blood glucose homeostasis and implementing a staged healing treatment plan, providing a powerful solution for diabetic wound care.

         <title>Synergistic Integration of Halide Perovskite and Rare&#8208;Earth Ions toward Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a comprehensive review of the synergistic integration of halide perovskite and rare&#8208;earth ions toward photonics including structural features, optical properties, preparation methods, and photonic applications. Critical challenges and perspectives are introduced. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for perovskite and rare&#8208;earth composites and their intriguing future application scenario.








Abstract
Halide perovskites (HPs), emerging as a noteworthy class of semiconductors, hold great promise for an array of optoelectronic applications,&#160;including anti&#8208;counterfeiting, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), solar cells (SCs), and photodetectors, primarily due to their large absorption cross section, high fluorescence efficiency, tunable emission spectrum within the visible region, and high tolerance for lattice defects, as well as their adaptability for solution&#8208;based fabrication processes. Unlike luminescent HPs with band&#8208;edge emission, trivalent rare&#8208;earth (RE) ions typically emit low&#8208;energy light through intra&#8208;4f optical transitions, characterized by narrow emission spectra and long emission lifetimes. When fused, the cooperative interactions between HPs and REs endow the resulting binary composites not only with optoelectronic properties inherited from their parent materials but also introduce new attributes unattainable by either component alone. This review begins with the fundamental optoelectronic characteristics of HPs and REs, followed by a particular focus on the impact of REs on the electronic structures of HPs and the associated energy transfer processes. The advanced synthesis methods utilized to prepare HPs, RE&#8208;doped compounds, and their binary composites are overviewed. Furthermore, potential applications are summarized across diverse domains, including high&#8208;fidelity anticounterfeiting, bioimaging, LEDs, photovoltaics, photodetection, and photocatalysis, and conclude with&#160;remaining challenges and future research prospects.

         <title>Restrictive Heterointerfacial Delamination in Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics Using a Bifacial Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80&#160;cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

         <title>Bionic Olfactory Neuron with In&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing for Intelligent Gas Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy integrates an OFET array with in&#8208;sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) array with in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs&#8212;among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e&#8208;noses.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial&#8208;scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post&#8208;treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA&#8208;K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high&#8208;performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA&#8208;K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA&#8208;K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial&#8208;scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA&#8208;K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

         <title>Atomically Engineered Trimetallic Nanoclusters Toward Enhanced Photoluminescence and Photoinitiation Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The central doping of Pd/Pt atoms and the surface&#8208;motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved in trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) nanoclusters, which are synthesized via using the M&#8208;doped Au25 template. This co&#8208;doping strategy can significantly enhance the photoluminescence intensity and efficiency by affecting radiative relaxation and nonradiative relaxation pathways simultaneously.









Abstract
Precise doping is of vital significance for atomic engineering and the establishment of structure&#8208;property relationships in nanocluster (NC) chemistry. Herein, two novel trimetallic MAu18Cd3 (M = Pd/Pt) NCs that are derived from M&#8208;doped Au25 templates of MAu24 are reported, in which the central doping of M atom and the surface&#8208;motif doping of Cd atoms are concurrently achieved. Compared to the original templates, Cd&#8208;induced surface engineering enhances the rigidity of the structural framework and enlarges the HOMO&#8208;LUMO gaps of the MAu18Cd3, significantly improving photoluminescent efficiency by suppressing nonradiative relaxation. The critical role of the central M (Pd/Pt) dopant in photoluminescence, which regulates the rate of radiative decay of excited&#8208;state electrons, has also been substantiated. More notably, the doped case of PtAu18Cd3 exhibits excellent photoinitiation activity in 3D two&#8208;photon printing with a high resolution of &#8776;140&#160;nm, which may be attributed to the prolonged excited state. Overall, this work provides a generalized routine for the precise synthesis of multi&#8208;metal NCs with concurrent enhancements in photoluminescence and photoinitiation activity, which is expected to stimulate further research for the design and preparation of multi&#8208;functional, multi&#8208;metal NCs.

         <title>Triazine&#8208;containing Covalent Organic Polymer&#8208;derived Grid&#8208;Like Multilocular Spheres for Aqueous Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grid&#8208;like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). It enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675 Wh kg&#8722;1 in KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid&#8208;like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as&#8208;fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in redox&#8208;active electrolyte (KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro&#8208;activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox&#8208;active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application&#8208;inspired cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

         <title>Rapid and Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self&#8208;Generated Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low&#8208;cost self&#8208;accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent&#8208;free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self&#8208;accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent&#8208;free, vacuum&#8208;free, and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self&#8208;accelerated synthesis is driven by the self&#8208;generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o&#8208;substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol&#8208;functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self&#8208;accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

         <title>Piezoelectric&#8208;Enhanced Nanocatalysts Trigger Neutrophil N1 Polarization against Bacterial Biofilm by Disrupting Redox Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signaling provides an emerging strategy for anti&#8208;infective treatment. Here, the MOF nanocatalytic system induces a strong antibacterial response by triggering redox homeostasis imbalance in both of the bacteria and neutrophils, and initiate neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment.








Abstract
Strategies of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signals have revolutionized therapeutics involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, certain diseases with dual resistance barriers to the attacks by both ROS and immune cells, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants, are difficult to eradicate by a single exogenous oxidative stimulus due to the diversity and complexity of the redox species involved. Here, this work demonstrates that metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles capable of disrupting the bacterial ROS&#8208;defense system can dismantle bacterial redox resistance and induce potent antimicrobial immune responses in a mouse model of surgical implant infection by simultaneously modulating redox homeostasis and initiating neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment. Mechanistically, the piezoelectrically enhanced MOF triggers ROS production by tilting the band structure and acts synergistically with the aurintricarboxylic acid loaded within the MOF, which inhibits the activity of the cystathionine &#947;&#8208;cleaving enzyme. This leads to biofilm structure disruption and antigen exposure through homeostatic imbalance and synergistic activation of neutrophil N1 polarization signals. Thus, this study provides an alternative but promising strategy for the treatment of antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilm infections.

         <title>Trace Adsorptive Removal of PFAS from Water by Optimizing the UiO&#8208;66 MOF Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a prototypal platform of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer&#8211;MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record&#8208;high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest&#8208;accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;Using a prototypal platform of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer&#8211;MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record-high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest-accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.

Multimodal Sensing Ionogels
In article number 2414663, Chen Xu, Shengqiang Bai, Ziqi Liang, and coworkers demonstrat the multimodal sensing capabilities of a paradigm ionogel, [EMIM][TFSI]/PVDF&#8211;HFP. Under applied temperature and pressure fields, the iongel exhibits piezoelectric (PE) augmented ionic thermoelectric (iTE) properties, where ion transport is modulated by a PE&#8208;induced internal field. Such dual&#8208;stimuli sensitivity, coupled with iTE&#8208;based humidity responsiveness, holds great potential for clinical applications. It can effectively monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, cardiac function, and blood loss from wounds.

Extracellular Protein Identification Cytometry
Knowledge of the extracellular matrix drives our understanding of cell behavior. However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations. More details can be found in article number 2415981 by Jeroen Leijten and co&#8208;workers.

Stretchable Microelectrode Array
In article number 2412953, Kiup Kim and co&#8208;workers introduce a highly stretchable 3D MEA with PEDOT:PSS protruding microelectrodes structurally designed to ensure a reliable and stable interface with organoids even under buoyant forces in media. This design achieves high SNR electrophysiological signals, enabling precise and non&#8208;invasive functional assessments of organoids. The system demonstrates significant potential for drug screening and disease modeling.

Epitaxial 1T&#8208;TaS2 Spirals
In article number 2413926, Yi&#8208;Hsien Lee and his colleagues demonstrate scalable synthesis of epitaxial TaS2 spirals. An intertwined charge density wave (CDW)&#8208;Mott appears with a commensurate CDW phase at room temperature. Modulated interlayer spacing effectively manipulates interlayer interactions, which opens a new avenue toward tunable collective properties in spiral 2D lattices.

Biofilm Eradication
In article number 2409633, Min Ge, Chuang Yang, Han Lin, Jianlin Shi, and co&#8208;workers developed a physical and chemical barrier breakthrough strategy for biofilms via redox homeostasis manipulation. The nanosystem can enhance the attack of ROS via exogenous stimulation while providing interference with endogenous H2S synthase to reduce the resistance of reducing species, which together lead to severe structural damage in biofilms. In addition, oxidative stress mediates N1 polarization of neutrophils, leading to immunobactericidal effects.

         <title>Machine Learning in Solid&#8208;State Hydrogen Storage Materials: Challenges and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge research and potential applications of machine learning in the field of solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials, including mechanism mining, high&#8208;throughput design, and scale&#8208;up assembly application, outlining a roadmap for more efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage solutions.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pioneering tool in advancing the research application of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials (HSMs). This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research of ML in resolving crucial issues such as low hydrogen storage capacity and unfavorable de&#8208;/hydrogenation cycling conditions. First, the datasets, feature descriptors, and prevalent ML models tailored for HSMs are described. Specific examples include the successful application of ML in titanium&#8208;based, rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based, solid solution, magnesium&#8208;based, and complex HSMs, showcasing its role in exploiting composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships and designing novel HSMs for specific applications. One of the representative ML works is the single&#8208;phase Ti&#8208;based HSM with superior cost&#8208;effective and comprehensive properties, tailored to fuel cell hydrogen feeding system at ambient temperature and pressure through high&#8208;throughput composition&#8208;performance scanning. More importantly, this review also identifies and critically analyzes the key challenges faced by ML in this domain, including poor data quality and availability, and the balance between model interpretability and accuracy, together with feasible countermeasures suggested to ameliorate these problems. In summary, this work outlines a roadmap for enhancing ML's utilization in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage research, promoting more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions.

Achieving high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) typically involves high fabrication pressure and operation pressure, which poses a significant challenge for the practical application of ASSBs. This review summarizes the pressure&#8208;related challenges and strategies for ASSBs and offers perspectives on how to reduce fabrication and operation pressure. The insights aim to guide the design of low&#8208;pressure ASSBs, thus facilitating their practical application.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology owing to their inherent safety and high theoretical energy density. However, achieving and maintaining solid&#8211;solid electronic and ionic contact in ASSBs generally requires high&#8208;pressure fabrication and high&#8208;pressure operation, posing substantial challenges for large&#8208;scale production and application. In recent years, significant efforts are made to address these pressure&#8208;related challenges. In this review, the impact of pressure on ASSBs is explored. First, the categories, origins, and challenges associated with pressure in ASSBs are outlined. Second, an overview of recent advancements in addressing pressure&#8208;related issues in ASSBs is provided, focusing on electrode materials and their interfaces with various solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Third, advanced characterizations and simulations employed to unravel the intricate electrochemical&#8211;mechanical interactions in ASSBs are examined. Finally, existing strategies and the insights on achieving low&#8208;stack&#8208;pressure ASSBs are presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based thermoelectric thin films demonstrate excellent adaptability to curved surfaces and deliver high output performance, making them a promising solution for thermal management and energy harvesting in portable electronics. This review summarizes their fabrication methods, strategies for property enhancement, and applications in power generation and cooling, while highlighting remaining challenges and proposing directions for future research.








Abstract
The development of highly integrated electronic components and the Internet of Things demands efficient thermal management and uninterrupted energy harvesting, which provides exciting opportunities for thermoelectric (TE) technology since it allows direct conversion between electricity and thermal energy. The improved output performance of TE devices has traditionally been driven by advancements in inorganic materials. Recently, there has been growing interest in studying substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based TE thin films because they provide improved adherence to curved surfaces and offer a more compact size compared to the corresponding rigid form of these materials. This review begins by summarizing various methods for fabricating freestanding inorganic&#8208;based TE films, including leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of certain materials, exfoliating layered&#8208;structure materials, using sacrificial substrates, and creating composites with flexible components such as polymers and carbon&#8208;based materials. A key challenge in achieving high device performance is determining how to maintain the favorable TE properties of inorganic materials. This can be addressed through strategies such as high inorganic content loading, multicomponent engineering, and interfacial structure design. The review also discusses the applications of substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based TE devices in both power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling. Finally, it outlines current challenges and proposes potential research directions to further advance the field.

         <title>Orbital Current Pumping From Ultrafast Light&#8208;driven Antiferromagnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 via terahertz emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. This phenomenon occurs when the magnonic orbital moment of the antiferromagnetic insulator &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is excited by the ultrafast laser, resulting in the pumping of orbital current into Pt/CuOx interface. 








Abstract
The orbital Hall effect originating from light materials with weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, has attracted considerable interest in spintronic applications. Recent studies demonstrate that orbital currents can be generated from charge currents through the orbital Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials. However, the generation of orbital currents in antiferromagnets has so far been elusive. In this work, this is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 via terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. A significant increase in THz signal is obtained in &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Pt/CuOx heterostructure compared to that of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Pt, with the maximum value occurring at a Pt thickness of 2&#160;nm. The enhancement of the THz signal is attributed to the fact that magnons injected into Pt excite a coupled spin&#8208;orbital current that flows toward the Pt/CuOx interface, aside from the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion in the Pt layer. The magnetoresistance contains the conventional spin&#8208;Hall magnetoresistance contributed by the Pt layer and an additional orbital contribution from the Pt/CuOx interface. The Pt/CuOx interface generates an orbital current and absorbs the orbital accumulation, similar to the orbital&#8208;Hall magnetoresistance. This finding provides a rich platform for orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion and opens an interdisciplinary field of antiferromagnetic orbitronics.

However, the generation of orbital currents in antiferromagnets has so far been elusive. In this work, this is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; via terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. A significant increase in THz signal is obtained in &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Pt/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure compared to that of &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Pt, with the maximum value occurring at a Pt thickness of 2&#160;nm. The enhancement of the THz signal is attributed to the fact that magnons injected into Pt excite a coupled spin-orbital current that flows toward the Pt/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interface, aside from the spin-to-charge conversion in the Pt layer. The magnetoresistance contains the conventional spin-Hall magnetoresistance contributed by the Pt layer and an additional orbital contribution from the Pt/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interface. The Pt/CuO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interface generates an orbital current and absorbs the orbital accumulation, similar to the orbital-Hall magnetoresistance. This finding provides a rich platform for orbital-to-charge conversion and opens an interdisciplinary field of antiferromagnetic orbitronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Programmable, Active, and Interactive Crystallization by Localized Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on deterministic characteristics in the structuring of materials via additive manufacturing, crystals can be grown in an active and interactive manner, which realizes spatiotemporal programming and reprogramming of crystals. In the present study, snowflake&#8208;like camphor crystals are demonstrated with their real&#8208;time seeding and reprogramming via in situ, localized photopolymerization of mixture systems, which launches an era of active crystallization.









Abstract
Additive manufacturing has sought active and interactive means of creating predictable structures with diverse materials. Compared to such active manufacturing tools, current crystallization strategies remain in statistical and passive programs of crystals via macroscale thermodynamic controllers, commonly lacking active means to intervene in crystal growth in a spatiotemporal manner. Herein, a strategy toward active and interactive programming and reprogramming of crystals, realized by real&#8208;time tangible feedback on growing crystals by delicately controlling the degree of in&#8208;situ, localized photopolymerization of polymeric structures via additive manufacturing is presented. Using this strategy, crystals can be seeded, guided, and even reprogrammed in a supersaturated liquid resin. In principle, the localized formation of sparse polymeric networks within supercooled resins can induce density fluctuation to trigger seed nucleation instantaneously, whereas the formation of dense networks can lower molecules&#8217; mobilities to inhibit crystal growth. Assisted by these active triggers and deterministic procedural aspects in additive manufacturing, growing crystals can be tangibly interacted through programmed polymeric structures, strengthening deterministic characteristics in crystal growth. It is suggested that crystal growth can be programmable with deterministic hierarchies within the created crystal's morphologies within the background of inherent stochasticity in crystallization, launching an era of convolutional growth of crystals.

         <title>Scintillating Glass Fiber Arrays Enable Remote Radiation Detection and Pixelated Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots with efficient scintillating luminescence are incorporated in glass fibers with low&#8208;loss waveguiding, enabling remote, real&#8208;time radiation detection. More importantly, the scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array with controlled thickness and length for use in remote pixilated X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The emerging metal halide perovskites are challenging the traditional scintillators in the field of radiation detection and radiography. However, they lack the capability for remote and real&#8208;time radiation monitoring and imaging in confined and hostile conditions. To address this issue, details on an inorganic scintillating glass fiber incorporating perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as highly efficient pixelated radiation emitters are reported, while the glass fibers themselves serve at the same time as low&#8208;loss waveguides, enabling long&#8208;distance and underwater X&#8208;ray detection. The multi&#8208;color emissions and controllable radiation sensitivities endow CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QD scintillating glass fibers with the potential as wearable and visualized radiation indicators. Furthermore, these scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array plate with a thickness of 7.5&#160;mm to enhance X&#8208;ray absorption for X&#8208;ray imaging. Leveraging the light&#8208;guiding character of glass fibers, a 5 &#215; 5 fiber array with fiber lengths up to 11&#160;cm has demonstrated the potential of remote pixelated X&#8208;ray imaging. This study offers a novel platform for the development of remote detectors and imagers for X&#8208;ray radiation.

Abstract
MXene has garnered growing interest in the field of electrochemistry, thanks to its unique electrical and surface characteristics. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in realizing its full potential in chemoresistive sensing applications. In this study, a novel unidirectional freeze&#8208;casting approach for fabricating a Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;facilitated vertically aligned MXene&#8208;based aerogel with enhanced chemoresistive sensing properties was introduced. Firstly, the persistent challenge of poor gelation in MXene was addressed by formulating a nanohybrid of MXene and PEDOT:PSS, which acted as flexible conductive nanobinder. Employing a unique freeze&#8208;casting method, MXene flakes interconnected by PEDOT:PSS, were stabilized into a flexible, vertically aligned structure, leading to maximum surface exposure and enhanced robustness. The resulting 3&#8208;dimentional (3&#8208;D) aerogel exhibited a fast, heightened chemoresistive response of 7 to 50 parts per million (ppm) acetone and expanded the working range to between 10 parts per billion (ppb)&#8208;8000 ppm. Interfacial heterostructures formed between MXene and PEDOT:PSS, provided active sites, reduced activation energy, and enhanced selectivity. Modulated MXene bandgap, and its electron mobility further facilitated electron transfer, and enhanced signal strength. The sensor showed excellent biocompatibility and was also successfully employed as a breathalyzing tool, for on&#8208;demand alcohol consumption monitoring.

         <title>Low Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity at High Temperatures Using Stable High&#8208;Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low thermal diffusivity at high temperature (800 &#176;C) is achieved using packed nanoparticles of high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations with low thermal conductivity and relatively high packing density of &#8776;50 %. The high entropy leads to remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures, thus enabling the low thermal conductivity of the packed nanoparticles.








Abstract
The realization of low thermal conductivity at high temperatures (0.11&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 800 &#176;C) in ambient air in a porous solid thermal insulation material, using stable packed nanoparticles of high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations (HESO&#8208;8 NPs) with a relatively high packing density of &#8776;50%, is reported. The high&#8208;density HESO&#8208;8 NP pellets possess around 1000&#8208;fold lower thermal diffusivity than that of air, resulting in much slower heat propagation when subjected to a transient heat flux. The low thermal conductivity and diffusivity are realized by suppressing all three modes of heat transfer, namely solid conduction, gas conduction, and thermal radiation, via stable nanoconstriction and infrared&#8208;absorbing nature of the HESO&#8208;8 NPs, which are enabled by remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures due to the high entropy. This work can elucidate the design of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation materials using high&#8208;entropy ceramic nanostructures.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes with a Malononitrile Group for In&#8208;Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight chemiluminescence (CL) probes with a malononitrile group are easily synthesized by introducing donors to regulate HClO&#8208;activated CL emissions from 600 to 750&#160;nm, with comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations supporting a concerted decomposition of the oxidized CL molecule, achieving high&#8208;contrast imaging of acute inflammation in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 24.77.









Abstract
Chemiluminescence (CL)&#160;imaging has emerged as a powerful approach to molecular imaging that allows exceptional sensitivity with virtually no background interference because of its unique capacity to emit photons without an external excitation source. Despite its high potential, the application of this nascent technique faces challenges because the current chemiluminescent agents have limited reactive sites, require complex synthesis, are insufficiently bright, and lack near&#8208;infrared emission. Herein, a series of HClO&#8208;activated chemiluminescent probes that exhibit robust near&#8208;infrared emission are studied. Specifically engineered to respond to HClO, a known biomarker of acute inflammation, these probes achieve high&#8208;contrast in vivo imaging by eliminating the need for constant external excitation. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the CL of the probes depends on the reactivity of the vinylene bonds, following a concerted decomposition of the oxidized chemiluminescent molecule. The application of these chemiluminescent nanoparticles in vivo facilitates high&#8208;contrast imaging of acute inflammation, providing real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast visualization of inflammatory conditions. This advancement signifies a leap forward for chemiluminescent nanoplatforms in biomedical imaging and expands the available methodologies in this field.

         <title>Nanoelectrode&#8208;Mediated Extracellular Electrical Stimulation Directing Dopaminergic Neuronal Differentiation of Stem Cells for Improved Parkinson's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wireless nanoelectrodes made of electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are anchored to the membrane of neural stem cells to enable their migration together with the cells and precise extracellular electrical stimulation to the membrane receptors under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of stem cells into specifical dopaminergic neurons and improves the repair of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Neural&#8208;stem&#8208;cell (NSC)&#8208;based therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of PD but its therapeutic performance is limited by low efficiency of differentiation of NSCs to dopaminergic neurons. Although electrical stimulation can promote neuronal differentiation, it is not verified whether it can induce the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Meanwhile, it is a great challenge to precisely apply electrical stimulation to dynamically migrating NSCs after transplantation. Here, electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are designed to anchor to the membrane of NSCs to serve as wireless nanoelectrodes. After anchoring to the cell membrane, these nanoelectrodes are able to migrate together with the cells and precisely apply extracellular electrical stimulation to the receptors or ion transport channels on the membrane of transplanted cells under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation induces 38.46% of the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, while the percentage is only 5.82% for NSCs without the nanoelectrode stimulation. Transplantation of NSCs anchored with the nanoelectrodes effectively improves the recovery of the motor and memory ability of PD mice under alternating magnetic field within 2 weeks.

         <title>Engineering Mild&#8208;Photothermal Responsive and NO Donor Prussian Blue Nanozymes Using Mild Synthesis for Inflammation Regulation and Bacterial Eradication in Periodontal Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a mild strategy to synthesis of mild&#8208;photothermal responsive and NO donor Prussian blue nanozymes for inflammation regulation and bacterial eradication in periodontal disease.








Abstract
Periodontitis, an infectious disease of periodontal tissues caused by oral bacterial biofilms, is characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and immune microenvironment imbalance. Multifunctional nanozymes, leveraging their physiochemical properties and enzymatic activities, offer promising antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory strategies for managing periodontitis. In particular, Prussian blue nanozymes (PBzymes) exhibit exceptional ROS control due to their robust catalytic activity, diverse antioxidant functions, and high biocompatibility. However, the practical application of traditional high&#8208;temperature synthesis methods is limited. This study introduces a class of metal&#8208;engineered PBzymes synthesized at room temperature, identified for their potent antioxidative activity and excellent photothermal performance at mild temperatures. Nitric oxide (NO) gas therapy offers promising strategies for targeting deep infections in periodontal tissues. Thus, sodium nitroprusside is introduced into PBzyme to create SPBzyme via an in situ loading method. NO release by SPBzyme enhances antibacterial effects and overcomes resistance linked to bacterial biofilms, resulting in mild&#8208;photothermal antibacterial properties and synergistic antioxidant effects. In vitro antibacterial assays demonstrate the superior efficacy of SPBzyme under mild temperature conditions and near&#8208;infrared light exposure. Furthermore, SPBzyme effectively reduces inflammation and has positive therapeutic effects in periodontal animal models. Overall, mild&#8208;temperature photothermal NO release nanozyme therapy represents a novel approach for treating periodontitis.

         <title>Polyanionic Electrolyte Ionization Desalination Empowers Continuous Solar Evaporation Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyanionic electrolyte ionization functionalisation via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition as desalination strategy is implemented here to a localized thermal solar evaporator empowering continuous evaporation over extended periods of time and under real sweater from the Yellow Sea and from the East China Sea.








Abstract
Solar evaporation contributes to sustainable and environmentally friendly production of fresh water from seawater and wastewater. However, poor salt resistance and high degree of corrosion of traditional evaporators in brine make their implementation in real applications scarce. To overcome such deficiency, a polyanionic electrolyte functionalization strategy empowering excellent uniform desalination performance over extended periods of time is exploited. This 3D superhydrophilic graphene oxide solar evaporator design ensures stable water supply by the enhanced self&#8208;driving liquid capillarity and absorption at the evaporation interface as well as efficient vapor diffusion. Meanwhile, the polyanionic electrolyte functionalization implemented via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer static deposition of polystyrene sodium sulfonate effectively regulates/minimizes the flux of salt ions by exploiting the Donnan equilibrium effect, which eventually hinders local salt crystallization during long&#8208;term operation. Stable evaporation rates in line with the literature of up to 1.68&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 are achieved for up to 10 days in brine (15&#8240; salinity) and for up to 3 days in seawater from Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea (9&#8240; salinity); while, maintaining evaporation efficiencies of &#8776;90%. This work demonstrates the excellent benefits of polyanionic electrolyte functionalization as salt resistance strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance solar powered seawater desalination technology and others.

         <title>Metaplasticity&#8208;Enabled Graphene Quantum Dot Devices for Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Artificial Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;terminal metaplastic resistive memory device is developed by combining graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with iron oxide (FeOx). This research contributes to the field of neuromorphic computing by providing a scalable and reconfigurable hardware solution that effectively integrates metaplasticity into artificial synaptic devices, addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting in current neural network architectures.









Abstract
The limitations of deep neural networks in continuous learning stem from oversimplifying the complexities of biological neural circuits, often neglecting the dynamic balance between memory stability and learning plasticity. In this study, artificial synaptic devices enhanced with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) that exhibit metaplasticity is introduced, a higher&#8208;order form of synaptic plasticity that facilitates the dynamic regulation of memory and learning processes similar to those observed in biological systems. The GQDs&#8208;assisted devices utilize interface&#8208;mediated modifications in asymmetric conductive pathways, replicating classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This allows for repeatable and linearly programmable adjustments to future weight changes linked to historical weights. Incorporating metaplasticity is essential for achieving generalization within deep neural networks, which enables them to adapt more fluidly to new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge. The GQDs&#8208;device&#8208;based system achieved a 97% accuracy on the fourth MNIST dataset task, while consistently achieving performance levels above 94% on prior tasks. This performance substantiates the feasibility of directly transferring metaplasticity principles to deep neural networks, thereby addressing the challenges associated with catastrophic forgetting. These findings present a promising hardware solution for developing neuromorphic systems with robust and sustained learning capabilities that can effectively bridge the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.

In this study, artificial synaptic devices enhanced with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) that exhibit metaplasticity is introduced, a higher-order form of synaptic plasticity that facilitates the dynamic regulation of memory and learning processes similar to those observed in biological systems. The GQDs-assisted devices utilize interface-mediated modifications in asymmetric conductive pathways, replicating classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This allows for repeatable and linearly programmable adjustments to future weight changes linked to historical weights. Incorporating metaplasticity is essential for achieving generalization within deep neural networks, which enables them to adapt more fluidly to new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge. The GQDs-device-based system achieved a 97% accuracy on the fourth MNIST dataset task, while consistently achieving performance levels above 94% on prior tasks. This performance substantiates the feasibility of directly transferring metaplasticity principles to deep neural networks, thereby addressing the challenges associated with catastrophic forgetting. These findings present a promising hardware solution for developing neuromorphic systems with robust and sustained learning capabilities that can effectively bridge the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8211;Birds Strategy for Intervertebral Disc Repair: Constructing a Reductive Chelation Hydrogel to Mitigate Oxidative Stress and Promote Disc Matrix Reconstruction</title>

HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu is a new type of hydrogel formed by reducing crosslinking, which shows multi&#8208;functions such as injectable, self&#8208;healing, reactive oxygen species clearance, photothermal properties, and so on. The successful application of HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu in combination with mild photothermal therapy in the treatment of disc degeneration strongly proves its promising application potential.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is characterized by fibrosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accelerated surrounding extracellular matrix catabolism. Bioactive hydrogels have shown significant potential in regulating cellular functions and tissue homeostasis. In this work, a dynamic hydrogel (HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu) is designed via the reductive chelation of hyaluronic acid grafted with thiourea (HA&#8208;NCSN) and Cu2+. The reductivity of the grafted thiourea groups of HA&#8208;NCSN can quickly reduce part of the chelated Cu2+ to Cu+. Therefore, during the gelation process, the color of hydrogel become dark immediately, which endowed hydrogel with remarkable photothermal effect. The abundant thiourea groups inside hydrogel can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species to mitigate the inflammatory stress of NP cells. RNA sequencing analysis further reveals that glutathione signaling pathway is significantly altered. Meanwhile, mild photothermal therapy could activate the TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad pathway in NP cells, promoting the expression and secretion of Aggrecan and Collagen II. Ultimately, the combined modulation of inflammation alleviation and matrix regeneration achieves the restoration of the structure and function of the damaged intervertebral disc, which is also strongly demonstrated by the in vivo animal experiments. All of these results demonstrate the great potential of the dynamic HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu hydrogel in IVDD treatment.

         <title>Personalized Multi&#8208;Epitope Nanovaccine Unlocks B Cell&#8208;Mediated Multiple Pathways of Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antigen&#8208;adjuvant spatiotemporally&#8208;synchronized multi&#8208;epitope nanovaccine, termed as CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti&#8208;CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. The nanovaccine improves the antibody&#8208;secreting and antigen&#8208;presenting abilities of B cells, providing a multi&#8208;pronged approach to activation of antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
B lymphocytes have emerged as an important immune&#8208;regulating target. Inoculation with tumor cell membrane&#8208;derived vaccines is a promising strategy to activate B cells, yet their efficiency is limited due to lack of costimulatory molecules. To amplify B cell responses against tumor, herein, a spatiotemporally&#8208;synchronized antigen&#8208;adjuvant integrated nanovaccine, termed as CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti&#8208;CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40 actively accumulates in lymph nodes and is effectively captured by antigen&#8208;presenting cells via the recognition of CD40 by aCD40. Tumor antigens on CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40 bind to B cell receptors, providing the first stimulation signal for B cells. Meanwhile, the interaction between CpG/Toll like receptor and aCD40/CD40 provides superposed co&#8208;stimulation signals, improving the antibody&#8208;secreting and antigen&#8208;presenting abilities of B cells. The nanovaccine also stimulates dendritic cells to activate CD8+ T cells, and reprograms tumor associated macrophages. CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40 activating humoral, cellular, and innate antitumor immunity achieves a tumor inhibition rate of 89.3%, which is further improved to 95.4% when combined with the anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody. CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40, as a personalized multi&#8208;epitope nanovaccine, paves the way for ushering the era of B cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Multiple Polarization States in Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 Thin Films by Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the three&#8208;step domain switching characteristic in Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 thin films with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric coupling, in the form of triple&#8208;peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. By fully switching individual peaks in the triple&#8208;peak EC distribution, the long&#8208;sought reliable operation of 3&#8208;bit per cell are realized in the Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 films, including high endurance, small device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, and long data retention.








Abstract
HfO2&#8208;based multi&#8208;bit ferroelectric memory combines non&#8208;volatility, speed, and energy efficiency, rendering it a promising technology for massive data storage and processing. However, some challenges remain, notably polarization variation, high operation voltage, and poor endurance performance. Here we show Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 (x&#160;=&#160;0.65 to 0.75) thin films grown through sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2 and ZrO2 exhibiting three&#8208;step domain switching characteristic in the form of triple&#8208;peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. This long&#8208;sought behavior shows nearly no changes even at up to 125&#160;&#176;C and after 1 &#215; 108 electric field cycling. By combining the electrical characterizations and integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM), we&#160;reveal that the triple&#8208;peak EC distribution is driven by the coupling of ferroelectric switching and reversible antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric transition. We further demonstrate the 3&#8208;bit per cell operation of the Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 capacitors with excellent device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation and long data retention,&#160;by the full switching of individual peaks in the triple&#8208;peak EC. The work represents a significant step in implementing reliable non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;state ferroelectric devices.

         <title>A Library of Seed@High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Core&#8211;shell Nanocrystals With Controlled Facets for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of seed@high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy core&#8211;shell nanocrystals with up to ten elements and well&#8208;defined facets are synthesized via seed&#8208;mediated growth. Several facet&#8208;dependent catalytic activities are identified in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, with active sites determined by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory. This work advances facet engineering in a multi&#8208;elemental scope and unveils the potential for catalysis.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios.

&lt;p&gt;A library of seed@high-entropy-alloy core&#8211;shell nanocrystals with up to ten elements and well-defined facets are synthesized via seed-mediated growth. Several facet-dependent catalytic activities are identified in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, with active sites determined by in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density-functional theory. This work advances facet engineering in a multi-elemental scope and unveils the potential for catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-entropy-alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet-controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed-mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core&#8211;shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid-solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low-index and high-index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition- and facet-dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density-functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi-elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoimmunologic Therapy of Stubborn Biofilm via Inhibiting Bacteria Revival and Preventing Reinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oligo&#8208;ethylene glycol&#8208;modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer is developed for photoimmunologic therapy of stubborn biofilm. It not only downregulates the two&#8208;component system, quorum sensing, and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth, and accelerating wound healing but also triggers immunogenetic cell death to promote short&#8208;term immune and long&#8208;term immunological memory enhancement for coping with secondary infections.








Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to public health. Clinical practices highly rely on mechanical debridement and antibiotics, which often fail and lead to persistent and recurrent infections. The main culprits are 1) persistent bacteria reviving, colonizing, and rejuvenating biofilms, and 2) secondary pathogen exposure, particularly in individuals with chronic diseases. Addressing how to inhibit persistent bacteria revival and prevent reinfection simultaneously is still a major challenge. Herein, an oligo&#8208;ethylene glycol&#8208;modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer (PS), TBTCP&#8208;PEG7, is developed. It effectively eradicates Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under light irradiation. Furthermore, TBTCP&#8208;PEG7&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only conquers stubborn biofilm infections by downregulating the two&#8208;component system (TCS), quorum sensing (QS), and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth and biofilm remodeling but also prevents reinfection by upregulating heat shock protein&#8208;related genes to induce immunogenetic cell death (ICD) and establish immune memory. In vivo, TBTCP&#8208;PEG7 efficiently eradicates MRSA biofilm adhered to medical catheters, stimulates angiogenesis, reduces inflammatory factor expression, and accelerates wound healing. Furthermore, ICD promotes short&#8208;term immune and long&#8208;term immunological memory for coping with secondary infections. This two&#8208;pronged strategy not only effectively overcomes stubborn, persistent and recurrent biofilm infection, but also provides theoretical guidance for designing the next generation of antibacterial materials.

         <title>A Novel Deer Antler&#8208;Inspired Bone Graft Triggers Rapid Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the rapid regeneration of antlers, HAMA hydrogel as a carrier for incorporating EVsABPCs into antler&#8208;DCB is utilized. Notably, the antler&#8208;DCB@EVsABPCs showed a strong ability to recruit endogenous BMSCs and transformed them an ABPC&#8208;like cells, thereby facilitating rapid bone formation. Additionally, the bone graft triggered bone growth coordinated with angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation, which partially imitating early phase antlerogenesis.








Abstract
Adult mammals are unable to regenerate bulky bone tissues, making large bone defects clinically challenging. Deer antler represents an exception to this rule, exhibiting the fastest bony growth in mammals, offering a unique opportunity to explore novel strategies for rapid bone regeneration. Here, a bone graft exploiting the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characteristics of antlers is constructed. It is decellularized antler cancellous bone (antler&#8208;DCB) to obtain a bone scaffold. Then, an antler&#8208;based bone graft is constructed by integrating antler&#8208;DCB with antler&#8208;derived biological signals, delivered by extracellular vesicles (EVs) from antler blastema progenitor cells (ABPCs), a novel stem cells responsible for antlerogenesis is discovered. The antler&#8208;based bone graft transformed bone marrow stromal cells into cells with an ABPC&#8208;like phenotype and transcriptomic signature. In vivo, the antler&#8208;based graft triggered rapid bone formation in a rat model, with doubled volume of newly formed bones than commercial DCBs. In addition, the antler&#8208;based graft orchestrated a coordinated process of vascularization, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation during osteogenesis, partially imitating early antlerogenesis. These findings provide practical insights to develop a therapeutic intervention for treating severe bone defects.

         <title>Stabilizing Electron Transport of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials are a potential candidate for beyond&#8208;silicon electronics. However, the stability is one of the key bottlenecks in the progress of 2D materials. Here, a strategy is developed that greatly improves the performance and stability of 2D materials and devices by using vitamin C. The increase in mobility is more than ten times, and the performance can be maintained in air conditions for more than 327 days.








Abstract
2D materials are promising candidates for beyond&#8208;Si electronic devices. However, their stability is a key bottleneck in their industrial applications. The instability of 2D materials is mainly attributed to their intrinsic susceptibility to O2 and H2O&#8212;particularly to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have strong oxidizing properties. Inspired by the antioxidant effect of vitamin C (VC) in organisms, a strategy based on the use of VC to stabilize electron transport in 2D materials is developed, which significantly improves the performance and stability of these materials and devices. The mobility is increased by more than an order of magnitude, and excellent performance of the device is maintained in air for &gt;327 days, which is the best reported stability for MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors to date. VC scavenges existing ROS via oxidation reactions and inhibits the generation of ROS by shielding excitons from oxygen quenching, which provides 2D materials lasting protection from electron trapping and oxidative damage, stabilizing electron transport. This approach, which is based on the simple utilization of readily available VC, has considerable potential for large&#8208;scale applications in the 2D material electronics industry.

         <title>Rationally Engineering Pro&#8208;Proteins and Membrane&#8208;Penetrating &#945;&#8209;Helical Polypeptides for Genome Editing Toward Choroidal Neovascularization Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine triphosphate&#8208;tagged pro&#8208;proteins are engineered to form stable nanocomplexes with guanidyl&#8208;rich, &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide and enable robust cytosolic delivery. By delivering ribonucleoprotein, this system induces pronounced genome editing against hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; after intravitreal injection, inhibiting neovascularization and subretinal fibrosis in choroidal neovascularization mice.









Abstract
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing holds great potential for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which however, is challenged by the lack of efficient cytosolic protein delivery tools. Herein, reversibly&#8208;phosphorylated pro&#8208;proteins (P&#8208;proteins) with conjugated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tags are engineered and coupled with a membrane&#8208;penetrating, guanidine&#8208;enriched, &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide (LGP) to mediate robust and universal cytosolic delivery. LGP forms salt&#8208;stable nanocomplexes (NCs) with P&#8208;proteins via electrostatic interaction and salt bridging, and the helix&#8208;assisted, strong membrane activities of LGP enabled efficient cellular internalization and endolysosomal escape of NCs. Therefore, this approach allows efficient cytosolic delivery of a wide range of protein cargoes and maintains their bioactivities due to endolysosomal acidity&#8208;triggered traceless restoration of P&#8208;proteins. Notably, intravitreally delivered LGP/P&#8208;RNP NCs targeting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) induce pronounced gene disruption to downregulate pro&#8208;angiogenic factors and alleviate subretinal fibrosis, ultimately provoking robust therapeutic efficacy in CNV mice. Such a facile and versatile platform provides a powerful tool for cytosolic protein delivery and genome editing, and it holds promising potential for the treatment of CNV&#8208;associated diseases, such as age&#8208;related macular degeneration.

&lt;p&gt;Adenosine triphosphate-tagged pro-proteins are engineered to form stable nanocomplexes with guanidyl-rich, &#945;-helical polypeptide and enable robust cytosolic delivery. By delivering ribonucleoprotein, this system induces pronounced genome editing against hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; after intravitreal injection, inhibiting neovascularization and subretinal fibrosis in choroidal neovascularization mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-based CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing holds great potential for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which however, is challenged by the lack of efficient cytosolic protein delivery tools. Herein, reversibly-phosphorylated pro-proteins (P-proteins) with conjugated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tags are engineered and coupled with a membrane-penetrating, guanidine-enriched, &#945;-helical polypeptide (&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;GP) to mediate robust and universal cytosolic delivery. &lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;GP forms salt-stable nanocomplexes (NCs) with P-proteins via electrostatic interaction and salt bridging, and the helix-assisted, strong membrane activities of &lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;GP enabled efficient cellular internalization and endolysosomal escape of NCs. Therefore, this approach allows efficient cytosolic delivery of a wide range of protein cargoes and maintains their bioactivities due to endolysosomal acidity-triggered traceless restoration of P-proteins. Notably, intravitreally delivered &lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;GP/P-RNP NCs targeting hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;) induce pronounced gene disruption to downregulate pro-angiogenic factors and alleviate subretinal fibrosis, ultimately provoking robust therapeutic efficacy in CNV mice. Such a facile and versatile platform provides a powerful tool for cytosolic protein delivery and genome editing, and it holds promising potential for the treatment of CNV-associated diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ionic Diode&#8208;Based Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic diode&#8208;based drug delivery system is demonstrated, which uses electric potential for spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained drug release with minimal leakage. It provides flow&#8208;free drug delivery at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. In a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, it shows superior anti&#8208;tumor efficacy and reduced off&#8208;target immune toxicity compared to intratumoral drug injection.








Abstract
Drug delivery systems hold promise for delivering cytotoxic drugs by controlling the timing and location of the drug release. However, conventional delivery mechanisms often fall short of achieving spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained release, which is crucial for ensuring drug efficacy and minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. Here, an ionic diode&#8208;based drug delivery system is reported that is controlled by an electric potential and capable of releasing drugs at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. The migrated drug is slowly but continuously diffused to the lesion through the hydrogel at the desired rate. The ionic diode provides flow&#8208;free drug delivery while minimizing unintended drug leakage over prolonged periods. Implanted in a freely moving tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, the system filled with doxorubicin demonstrated superior anti&#8208;tumor efficacy and minimal off&#8208;target immune toxicity compared to the intratumoral injection of free doxorubicin. With its mechanically compliant and biocompatible components, the system offers a safe and readily translatable approach to patients with surgically unresectable tumors.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Powered Liquid Metal Degradation of Polyolefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;equilibrium microwave&#8208;powered liquid metal depolymerization is proposed for converting various polyolefin wastes into high&#8208;value olefin monomers and narrowband hydrocarbon oils by introducing. By leveraging the self&#8208;separation feature of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical&#8208;bond activation ability under microwave field, an unprecedented high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Upcycling waste plastics is highly promising to tackle global white pollution while achieving sustainable development. However, prevailing approaches often encounter challenges in scalable engineering practices due to either insufficient plastic upcycling capability or arduousness in the separation, recovery, and purification of catalysts, which inevitably augments the cost of plastic upcycling. Here, the microwave&#8208;powered liquid metal synergetic depolymerization is presented to facilitate low&#8208;cost plastic upcycling. By leveraging the fluidity of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical&#8208;bond activation ability under microwave field, this method efficiently converts various polyolefins into narrowband hydrocarbon oil (Oil yield: 81 wt.% for polypropylene (PP), 85.9 wt.% for polyethylene (PE)) and high&#8208;value olefin monomers (C2&#8208;4&#63742; selectivity: 50% for PE, 65.3% for PP) over 30 successive cycles, resulting in a high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal&#8722;1. These captivating advantages offered by electromagnetically&#8208;powered liquid metals are also supported by their self&#8208;separation features, thereby paving the way for large&#8208;scale engineering solutions in waste plastic upcycling.

         <title>Toward Long&#8208;Life High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: from Solvation Chemistry to Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Interphase Layer Optimization Against Electron Tunneling Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel acetamide&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte with enhanced solvation chemistry design, combined with a widened operation voltage range to induce hydrogen evolution reaction, forms a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer, mitigating electron tunneling and significantly improving the cycle stability of high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Water is pursued as an electrolyte solvent for its non&#8208;flammable nature compared to traditional organic solvents, yet its narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) limits its performance. Solvation chemistry design is widely adopted as the key to suppress the reactivity of water, thereby expanding the ESW. In this study, an acetamide&#8208;based ternary eutectic electrolyte achieved an ESW ranging from 1.4 to 5.1&#160;V. The electrolyte confines water molecules within the primary solvation sheath of Li&#8208;ions, reducing the free water and breaking the hydrogen bond network. Despite this, initial capacity retention is suboptimal due to inadequate formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) layers. To address this, additional hydrogen evolution reaction is induced by widening the operation voltage range, thereby optimizing the SEI layer to mitigate the electron tunneling effect. This approach resulted in a denser LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer, effectively preventing water decomposition and improving long&#8208;term cycle stability. The optimized SEI layer reduced the electron tunneling barrier, achieving a discharge capacity of 152 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and maintaining 76% of its capacity (116 mAh g&#8722;1) after 1000 cycles. This study highlights the critical role of both solvation structure and SEI layer optimization in enhancing the performance of high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Personalized Vascularized Tumor Organoid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip for Tumor Metastasis and Therapeutic Targeting Assessment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A vascularized patient&#8208;derived tumor organoid (PDTO)&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with a hierarchical, tumor&#8208;specific microvasculature is developed, enabling high&#8208;resolution, real&#8208;time visualization of dynamic interactions within the tumor's perivascular niche. This platform effectively models tumor&#8208;driven angiogenesis and migration, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for assessing metastatic risk and guiding clinical strategies.








Abstract
While tumor organoids have revolutionized cancer research by recapitulating the cellular architecture and behaviors of real tumors in vitro, their lack of functional vasculature hinders their attainment of full physiological capabilities. Current efforts to vascularize organoids are struggling to achieve well&#8208;defined vascular networks, mimicking the intricate hierarchy observed in vivo, which restricts the physiological relevance particularly for studying tumor progression and response to therapies targeting the tumor vasculature. An innovative vascularized patient&#8208;derived tumor organoids (PDTOs)&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with hierarchical, tumor&#8208;specific microvasculature is presented, providing a versatile platform to explore tumor&#8208;vascular dynamics and antivascular drug efficacy. It is found that highly metastatic tumor cells induced vessel angiogenesis and simultaneously migrated toward blood vessels via the Notch pathway. The evident association between the angiogenic and migratory capacities of PDTOs and their clinical metastatic outcomes underscores the potential of the innovative platform for evaluating tumor metastasis, thus offering valuable insights for clinical decision&#8208;making. Ultimately, the system represents a promising avenue for advancing the understanding of tumor metastasis and developing personalized treatment strategies based on patient&#8208;specific tumor characteristics.

         <title>Accelerating the Electrochemical Formation of the &#948; Phase in Manganese&#8208;Rich Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of electrochemical pulsing which forms a spinel&#8208;like &#948; phase in Mn&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li&#8208;excess (DRX) (DRX) cathode materials is demonstrated. This concept is extended to large single&#8208;crystalline particles, greatly improving the cycling stability. X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM&#8208;HAADF were&#160;used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure separated by antiphase boundaries.









Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li&#8208;excess (DRX) materials have emerged as a promising class of earth&#8208;abundant and energy&#8208;dense next&#8208;generation cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Recently, an electrochemical transformation to a spinel&#8208;like &#8220;&#948;&#8221; phase has been reported in Mn&#8208;rich DRX materials, with improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability compared with previous DRX compositions. However, this transformation unfolds slowly over the course of cycling, complicating the development and understanding of these materials. In this work, it is reported that the transformation of Mn&#8208;rich DRX materials to the promising &#948; phase can be promoted to occur much more rapidly by electrochemical pulsing at elevated temperature, rate, and voltage. To extend this concept, micron&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal DRX particles are also transformed to the &#948; phase by the same method, possessing greatly improved cycling stability in the first demonstration of cycling for large, single&#8208;crystal DRX particles. To shed light on the formation and specific structure of the &#948; phase, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM&#8208;HAADF are used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure with minimal remnant&#160;disorder.

         <title>Highly Stretchable 3D Microelectrode Array for Noninvasive Functional Evaluation of Cardiac Spheroids and Midbrain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented, achieved through structural design of a non&#8208;stretching material and over&#8208;electrodeposition of PEDOT:PSS. sMEA enables tight contact with organoids despite exposure to buoyant force in medium, resulting in electrophysiological signals with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). High SNR signals allow for non&#8208;invasive functional assessment of the organoids for drug screening.








Abstract
Organoids are 3D biological models that recapitulate the complex structures and functions of human organs. Despite the rapid growth in the generation of organoids, in vitro assay tools are still limited to 2D forms. Thus, a comprehensive and continuous functional evaluation of the electrogenic organoids remains a challenge. Here, a highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented for functional evaluation of electrogenic organoids. The optimized serpentine structures with bridge structures cover the surface of the organoids conformally even in immersion. The protruding microelectrodes form a stable contact with the organoids and allow electrophysiological recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). sMEAs are fabricated in wafer&#8208;scale for repeatable, scalable, and mass production and packed into an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, user&#8208;friendly, and robust microwell for fast dissemination of technology. The versatility of sMEA is validated by measuring electrophysiological signals from cardiac spheroids and midbrain organoids with a wide range of sizes from 500 to 1500&#160;&#181;m. Also, electrophysiological signals recorded with high SNR enable functional evaluation of the effects of drugs. The proposed sMEA with high SNR and user&#8208;friendly interface could be the key player in high&#8208;throughput drug screening, 3D spatiotemporal mapping of electrogenic organoids, and standardization of protocols for quality assessment.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Cocatalysts Reinforcing Hole Consumption for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultrahigh Apparent Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is proposed that reinforces hole consumption to boost the oxidation half&#8208;reaction and ultimately the photocatalytic H2 production. This is achieved by the rational design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts as efficient oxidative sites, promoting the generation of sacrificial agents (CH3O&#8722;). Such a strategy can achieve a record apparent quantum efficiency of up to 65.8%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and sustainable hydrogen production through photocatalysis is highly promising yet remains a significant challenge, especially when replacing costly noble metals with more abundant alternatives. Conversion efficiency with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free alternatives is frequently limited by high charge recombination rates, mainly due to the sluggish transfer and inefficient consumption of photo&#8208;generated holes. To address these challenges, a rational design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts as oxidative sites is reported to facilitate hole consumption, leading to markedly increased H2 yield rates without relying on expensive noble metals. By integrating femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, the rapid hole consumption is compellingly confirmed, which in turn promotes the effective separation and migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers. The optimized catalyst delivers an impressive photocatalytic H2 yield rate of 57.84 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, coupled with an ultrahigh apparent quantum efficiency reaching up to 65.8%. Additionally, a flow&#8208;type quartz microreactor is assembled using the optimal catalyst thin film, which achieves a notable H2 yield efficiency of 0.102 mL min&#8722;1 and maintains high stability over 1260 min of continuous operation. The strategy of reinforcing hole consumption through noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts establishes a promising pathway for scalable and economically viable solar H2 production.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Zwitterionic Polysilazane Coatings with Mechanical Robustness, High Transparency, and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiadhesion Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for developing self&#8208;adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with excellent mechanical robustness and broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesion properties is proposed. The developed coatings exhibits excellent wear resistance, good flexibility, strong adhesion, and high transparency as well as anti&#8208;biofouling, anti&#8208;liquid adhesion, and anti&#8208;scaling properties. They have potential applications in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.








Abstract
Antiadhesive coatings have been extensively studied owing to their wide applications in biology, environment, and energy. However, developing a mechanically robust coating with broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesion properties remains challenging. Herein, a novel strategy for preparing hard yet flexible and self&#8208;adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesion properties (anti&#8208;biofouling, anti&#8208;liquid adhesion, and anti&#8208;scaling) is proposed. The coatings are prepared by combining polysilazane with a telomer (FT) consisting of a low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy fluorine motif and hydrolysis&#8208;induced zwitterions. Before Si&#9472;OH generation in polysilazane, the fluorine motif drives the zwitterionic precursor to enrich on the surface, generating a zwitterionic layer following pre&#8208;hydrolysis. This unique design prevents the coatings from swelling in water, allowing them to adapt to diverse environments. The fluorine motif can orient toward the surface of air, providing anti&#8208;liquid adhesion capabilities, whereas the zwitterions orient underwater to endow anti&#8208;biofouling, anti&#8208;liquid adhesion, and anti&#8208;scaling capabilities. The highly cross&#8208;linked network toughened by FT contributes to the high hardness (up to 7H) and good flexibility of the coating. The chemical bonding between the coating and substrates ensures their strong adhesion (&#8776;2.06&#8211;7.67 MPa). This study contributes to the design of mechanically robust broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesive coatings applicable in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.

         <title>Popularizing Holistic High&#8208;Index Crystal Plane via Nonepitaxial Electrodeposition Toward Hydrogen&#8208;Embrittlement&#8208;Relieved Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized electrodeposition dynamics help mitigate severe hydrodynamic fluctuations and hydrogen embrittlement issues, which not only refines the Zn deposition quality but also cultivates high&#8208;index Zn (112) texture, rendering durable Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrodeposition is promising to fabricate Zn electrodes affording nonepitaxial single&#8208;crystal textures. Previous research endeavors focus on achieving Zn(002) faceted deposition, nevertheless, the popularization of a high&#8208;index Zn plane with favorable electrochemical activity remains poorly explored. There also exists a deficiency in the assessment of the electrodeposited quality of Zn. Here, a straightforward strategy to address such concerns by cultivating predominant Zn(112) texture via a potentiostatic electrodeposition mode is reported. By precisely identifying the &#8220;limiting&#8221; conditions for electrodeposition, a striking balance between improved deposition quality, tailored deposition kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution is found. (002) Faceted Zn electrode is shown that be indeed produced, yet the rampant hydrodynamic convection and hydrogen embrittlement issue under such &#8220;over&#8208;limiting&#8221; preparation conditions pose challenges in the electrode lifespan. In contrast, an optimized deposition minimizes hydrodynamic disturbances and mitigates the hydrogen embrittlement effect, where the thus&#8208;generated high&#8208;index (112)&#8208;textured Zn electrode manifests impressive deposition quality and demonstrates holistic cycling stability. The pouch cell by pairing a ZnxV2O5 (ZnVO) cathode manages a reversible capacity of &#8776;130&#160;mAh and a capacity retention of 98.42%. This study offers guidance for the development of dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;embrittlement&#8208;relieved Zn anodes, unleashing the potential of high&#8208;index plane textures for advanced Zn batteries.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Two&#8208;Photon Excitable AIE Photosensitizer for Precise and Efficient Treatment of Orthotopic Small&#8208;Size Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and efficient treatment of orthotopic small&#8208;size glioblastoma is realized in this work by fully taking advantage of two&#8208;photon excitation and an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer. The proposed photosensitizer with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, the second near&#8208;infrared excitation, the first near&#8208;infrared emission, and prominent ROS generation, contributes to remarkable tumor growth inhibition and an ultra&#8208;deep imaging depth in the brain.








Abstract
The existence of residual small&#8208;size tumors after surgery is a major factor contributing to the high recurrence rate of glioblastoma (GBM). Conventional adjuvant therapeutics involving both chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy and severe side effects. Recently, two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy (TP&#8208;PDT), especially excited by the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light, offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge, attributed to its combinational merits of PDT and TP excitation. However, this attempt has not been explored yet. On the other hand, the lack of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers (PSs) also hinders the progress of TP&#8208;PDT on GBM. Based on those, a robust TP&#8208;PS, termed MeTTh, is constructed intendedly through elaborately integrating multiple beneficial design strategies into a single molecule, which simultaneously achieves excellent NIR&#8208;II excitation, large absorption cross&#8208;section, aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;I emission, and prominent Type I/II reactive oxygen species generation. Aided by nanofabrication, an impressive brain structure imaging depth of 940&#160;&#181;m is realized. Moreover, MeTTh nanoparticles smoothly implement precise and efficient treatment of small&#8208;size GBM in vivo under a 1040&#160;nm femtosecond laser irradiation. This study represents first&#8208;in&#8208;class using TP&#8208;PDT on GBM, offering new insights for the therapy of small&#8208;size tumors in complex and vital tissues.

         <title>Intrinsic Localized Excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study indentifies localized excitons confined by substrate defects in the MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructure, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of intrinsic defects in modulating excitonic properties. Distinctive proximity&#8208;induced behaviors, including opposite valley polarization evolutions of MoSe2 excitons and novel in&#8208;plane anisotropic emissions, are reported. This work deepens the understanding of spectrally resolved proximity effects in magnetic van der Waals heterostructures.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on magnetic proximity effects, the fundamental excitonic properties of the 2D semiconductor&#8208;magnet heterostructures remain elusive. Here, the presence of localized excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructures is unveiled, represented by a new photoluminescence emission feature, X*. Our findings reveal that X* originates from excitons confined by intrinsic defects in the CrSBr layer. Additionally, the degrees of valley polarization of the X* and trion peaks exhibit opposite polarities under a magnetic field and closely correlate with the magnetic order of CrSBr. This is attributed to spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer across the heterointerface, supported by density functional theory calculations which reveal a type&#8208;II band alignment. Furthermore, the strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of CrSBr induces unique polarization&#8208;dependent responses in MoSe2 emissions. This study highlights the crucial role of defects in shaping excitonic properties and offers valuable insights into spectrally resolved proximity effects in semiconductor&#8208;magnet van der Waals&#160;heterostructures.

Thin film Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) on roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll gravure printing cylinders offers superior conductive ink transfer to flexible substrates compared to chrome. It enables fine lines and intricate structures for flexible electronics and security applications. DLC supports high&#8208;volume production of flexible microelectronics and micro&#8208;scale battery components, providing a more sustainable alternative to rigid electronics and reducing the carbon footprint.








Abstract
Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon (DLC), a thin&#8208;film material, is emerging as a promising alternative for durable surfaces due to its eco&#8208;friendly application process. This study evaluated the use of thin&#8208;film DLC on the wafer surface of gravure cylinders for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of fine&#8208;line electrodes and microtext patterns, specifically for applications in flexible electronics and graphics security. Results suggested that using thin film DLC on the wafer surface allows reliable reproduction of isometric grids and line structures with widths of 15, 20, and 30 &#181;m, as well as solid electrodes. The uniform conformity of thin&#8208;film DLC on the wafer surface, featuring an engraved micron&#8208;size cell structure, demonstrates superior ink transfer onto flexible PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrates. This results in increased electrode line width and reduced electrical resistance compared to chrome. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and repeatability of the findings. Visual analysis of lines and microtext also demonstrated the reliable print&#8208;reproducing capabilities of DLC&#8208;coated surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that thin&#8208;film DLC is a promising alternative for use as a protective layer on gravure wafer surfaces. It has the potential to produce high&#8208;quality, high&#8208;volume electronics, such as sensors, antennas, and batteries, for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other sustainable technologies.

         <title>Field&#8208;Induced Polarization Rotation in Order&#8211;Disorder (K,Na)NbO3&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>

A combination of advanced structural characterization at local and average scales and theoretical calculations reveals that the macroscopic rhombohedral&#8208;tetragonal phase coexistence of (K,Na)NbO3&#8208;based piezoceramics is essentially an average projection of collective local disordered units exhibiting the order&#8208;disorder behavior. The field&#8208;induced polarization rotation with a change in the degree of ordering is found to play a key role in boosting the functional properties of the investigated ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Phase boundary is highly recognized for its capability in engineering various physical properties of ferroelectrics. Here, field&#8208;induced polarization rotation is reported in a high&#8208;performance (K, Na)NbO3&#8208;based ferroelectric system at the rhombohedral&#8208;tetragonal phase boundary. First, the lattice structure is examined from both macroscopic and local scales, implementing Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function analysis, respectively. The macroscopic phase coexistence at the phase boundary can be interchangeably rationalized with an average projection of collective local disordered units, exhibiting the order&#8211;disorder nature. The structural evidence of field&#8208;induced polarization rotation is provided by the in situ synchrotron study. Theoretical studies including density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation also predict the polarization rotation mechanism. The simulation result reveals the variation of the degree of ordering during the polarization rotation as a key feature of the boosted electrical properties in the order&#8211;disorder ferroelectric system. The discovery provides meaningful insight into the design of ferroelectrics with enhanced physical properties.

         <title>Predesign of Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing anthracene and metalloporphyrin as the active components for the activation of oxygen and the catalysis of intramolecular cross&#8208;oxidation coupling reaction, respectively, a series of photosensitive and stable tandem heterogeneous COF catalysts are constructed for realizing the efficient photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An enables one&#8208;step, gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones in a short time and under mild conditions.








Abstract
The dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reaction is the premier route for synthesizing important 4&#8208;quinazolinone drugs. However, it usually requires high reaction temperature and long reaction time, and the yield of the final product is low. Here two stable and photosensitive covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), TAPP&#8208;An and TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An are purposefully designed and constructed to serve as unprecedented heterogeneous tandem catalysts to complete dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a short time and under mild reaction conditions (room temperature and light), leading to the high&#8208;efficient photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An is the best heterogeneous catalyst currently available for the synthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones, even surpassing all the catalysts reported so far. It also enables one&#8208;step photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones with higher conversion (&gt;99%) and selectivity (&gt;99%) in a shorter time, and the product can be easily prepared on a gram scale. Extensive experiments combined with theoretical calculations show that the excellent photogenerated charge separation and transport capability, as well as the synergistic An&#8208;Cu catalysis in TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An are the main driving forces for this efficient reaction.

         <title>Coordination Regulation Enabling Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Fast&#8208;Charging High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) composed of prop&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;sultone (PES) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) without additional additives is developed. The unique Li+&#8722;PES&#8722;TFSI&#8722; coordination structure in the DEE facilitates rapid ion transport. Meanwhile, the strengthened &#945;&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thereby enabling the cycle stability of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials in lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The safety and cycle stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under conditions of high cut&#8208;off voltage and fast charging put forward higher requirements for electrolytes. Here, a sulfonate&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) resulting from the eutectic effect between solid sultone and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide without any other additives is reported. The intermolecular coordination effect triggers this eutectic phenomenon, as evidenced with nuclear magnetic resonance, and thus the electrochemical behavior of the DEE can be controlled by jointly regulating the coordination effects of F&#183;&#183;&#183;H and Li&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions. The DEE with a properly coordinated environment of Li+ presents a low motion barrier and a high transport rate of localized Li+, leading to a 10 C fast&#8208;charging LiFePO4||Li battery with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, the strengthened &#945;&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thus enabling the cycle stability of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials in LMBs, e.g., a cycle stability at 4.5 V in the LiNi0.88Co0.07Mn0.05O2||Li battery with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 500 cycles, and an excellent compatibility in 4.5 V LiCoO2||Li and 4.8 V Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2||Li batteries. The practical applicability of the carefully designed DEE is underscored through successful implementation in pouch cells.

         <title>Introducing La into a Customized Dual Cu Covalent Organic Framework to Steer CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity from C2H4 to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Customized multi&#8208;metal sites within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a versatile platform for optimizing catalytic performance by precisely tuning metal composition based on their inherent properties. Specifically, the incorporation of oxophilic rare&#8208;earth La into the dual Cu COF steers CO2 electroreduction selectivity from C2H4 to CH4, which realizes the directional regulation of catalytic products.








Abstract
Customizing multi&#8208;metal site catalysts for achieving controllable CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) product tuning holds immense promise yet poses formidable challenges. The traditional synthesis method of multi&#8208;metal sites is the pyrolysis of metal&#8208;containing precursors, which is inherently uncontrollable. Herein, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is employed to customize and synthesize multi&#8208;metal sites in covalent organic frameworks&#160;(COFs), aiming to controllably switch the CO2 reduction selectivity by regulating the electronic structure of active sites. Briefly, La element provides chances for manipulating and finetuning the electronic structure of the customized dual Cu sites, and converts the main catalytic product of CO2RR from ethylene to methane. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of La alters the electronic structure around Cu, enhances CO2 and H2O activation, and changes the formation of energy barriers of key intermediates. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study constructed the first example of customized multi&#8208;metal site COF catalysts and provided new ideas for controllable modulation of products.

         <title>Low&#8208;Frequency Phonon Dispersion Relation Enabling Stable Cathode from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life. Local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, inhibits TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. The regenerated cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Direct recycling technology can effectively solve the environmental pollution and resource waste problems caused by spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) black mass by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life, which is attributed to the formation of spinel/rock salt phases and rotational stacking faults caused by the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of transition metal (TM) atoms during charge/discharge. Herein, local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, lowers the bending and stretching vibration frequencies of the TM&#9472;O covalent bond in cathode materials, and inhibits the TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. Beneficial from the favorable low&#8208;frequency phonon dispersion relation, the regenerated NCM represents remarkably enhanced structural stability during cycling, and exhibits good electrochemical performance. This reconstructed phonon dispersion relation approach broadens the perspective for lattice stress field engineering to suppress the defective structure raised from TM migration and paves the way for the development of regenerated cathodes with long durability.

         <title>Tunable Electron Correlation in Epitaxial 1T&#8208;TaS2 Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modulated interlayer spacing is observed for the first time in the epitaxial 2D spirals with electron correlations. Scalable synthesis of the epitaxial TaS2 spirals is achieved with customized CVD reactions. An intertwined CDW&#8208;Mott state appears at room&#8208;temperature in the epitaxial 1T&#8208;TaS2 spirals, offering a platform to study collective properties at high temperatures.








Abstract

Tantalum disulfide (1T&#8208;TaS2), being a Mott insulator with strong electron correlation, is highlighted for diverse collective quantum states in the 2D lattice, including charge density wave (CDW), spin liquid, and unconventional superconductivity. The Mott physics embedded in the 2D triangular CDW lattice has raised debates on stacking&#8208;dependent properties because interlayer interactions are sensitive to van der Waals (vdW) spacing. However, control of interlayer distance remains a challenge. Here, spiral lattices in the epitaxial TaS2 spirals are studied to probe collective properties with tunable interlayer interactions. A scalable synthesis of epitaxial TaS2 spirals is presented. A more than 50%&#8208;increased interlayer spacing enables prototype decoupled monolayers for enhanced electronic correlation exhibiting Mott physics at room&#8208;temperature and a simplified system to explore collective properties in vdW materials.

         <title>3D Heterogeneous Sensing System for Multimode Parrallel Signal No&#8208;Spatiotemporal Misalignment Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>A homo&#8208;spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is reported that expanded to realize multisignal no&#8208;spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission (4 times) via 3D vertical integration of four sensors.

Abstract
The spatiotemporal error caused by planar tiled structure design and the waste of communication resources brought on by the transmission of a single channel are two challenges facing the development of multifunctional intelligent sensors with high&#8208;density integration. A homo&#8208;spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is expanded to realize multisignal no&#8208;spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission. First, this system optimizes the distribution of multifunctional sensors, completes the 3D vertical heterogeneous layout of four sensors, and achieves material multi&#8208;information detection at a single place with no&#8208;spatiotemporal deviation. Additionally, the system couples and transmittes multiple sensory signals, delivering a fourfold increase in transmission efficiency and one&#8208;third of the power consumption compared to a single&#8208;channel transmission system. Finally, this system is used for the recognition of mixed materials, and human&#8208;computer interaction to realize the assignment of materials in VR, demonstrating the great accuracy and transmission efficiency of HMPTs as well as its feasibility in practical application. This is an a priori effort to enhance machine perception accuracy, improve signal transmission effectiveness, and advance human&#8208;machine&#8208;object triadic integration.

         <title>A Wet&#8208;Adhesion and Swelling&#8208;Resistant Hydrogel for Fast Hemostasis, Accelerated Tissue Injury Healing and Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel bioadhesive taking the structural advantage of phenylalanine derivative for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions is reported. The hydrogel adhesive can not only realize fast hemostasis and accelerated tissue/organ injuries healing in vivo but also can be assembled as bioelectronics for precise and long&#8208;term health monitoring under humid environments.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives with adequate wet adhesion and swelling resistance are urgently needed in clinic. However, the presence of blood or body fluid usually weakens the interfacial bonding strength, and even leads to adhesion failure. Herein, profiting from the unique coupling structure of carboxylic and phenyl groups in one component (N&#8208;acryloyl phenylalanine) for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions, a novel hydrogel adhesive (PAAS) is developed with superior tissue adhesion properties and matrix swelling resistance in challenging wet conditions (adhesion strength of 85 kPa, interfacial toughness of 450 J m&#8722;2, burst pressure of 514 mmHg, and swelling ratio of &lt;4%). The PAAS hydrogel can not only realize fast hemostasis of liver, heart, artery rupture, and sealing of pulmonary air&#8208;leakage but also accelerate the recovery of stomach and liver defects in rat, rabbit, and pig models. Moreover, PAAS hydrogel can precisely and durably monitor various physiological activities (pulse, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram) even under humid environments (immersion in water for 3 days), and can be employed for the evaluation of in vivo sealing efficiency for artery rupture. The work provides a promising hydrogel adhesive for clinical hemostasis, tissue injury repair, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Topological Transformation and Dimensional Reduction in Multicomponent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel synthetic approach to multicomponent MOFs by &#8220;standing on the shoulder of&#8221; a well&#8208;established one based on the new understanding on the self&#8208;assembly process. By making use of various chemical interactions during the self&#8208;assembly process, the structural transformation can be modulated from ternary 3D&#160;structures to quaternary 2D structures.








Abstract
Multicomponent MOFs have offered a wide range of opportunities to harness new properties. However, the synthesis of multicomponent MOFs remains challenging. This work demonstrates the synthesis of a family of multicomponent MOFs by topological transformation from well&#8208;established multicomponent partitioned acs (pacs) structures. Such transformation is based on the new understanding on the self&#8208;assembly process of pacs MOFs. A key to this understanding is that pacs structures, topologically regarded as the introduction of a pore&#8208;partitioning ligand into MOF&#8208;235/MIL&#8208;88 type framework, are likely to be formed in a layer&#8208;pillar&#8208;layer fashion in practical reactions. As the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between layers and other chemical interactions during the self&#8208;assembly process are recognized, the structural transformation can be modulated from 3D pacs structures to 2D interrupted pacs structures (denoted i&#8208;pacs). It is especially noteworthy that such dimensional reduction is first observed in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and the i&#8208;pacs MOFs contain four structural modules and up to five components, which have the highest complexity among 2D MOFs. Interestingly, the i&#8208;pacs MOFs have significantly enhanced performance for CO2/N2 separation in comparison with pacs MOFs.

         <title>Boosting Anionic Redox Reactions of Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes through Lattice Oxygen and Li&#8208;Ion Kinetics Modulation in Working All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The reversibility and activity of anionic redox reactions in lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are significantly enhanced by the simultaneous incorporation of high&#8208;binding energy B&#9472;O bonds and high&#8208;efficiency LBO ionic networks into LRMO. This results in the formation of a robust LRMO&#8208;LBO interwoven structure, which stabilizes the layered structure and LRMO|solid electrolyte interface, thereby contributing to superior long&#8208;term cycling stability in ASSBs.








Abstract
The use of lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) as the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) holds great potential for realizing high energy density over 600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. However, their implementation is significantly hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior reversibility of anionic redox reactions of oxygen in ASSBs. In this contribution, boron ions (B3+) doping and 3D Li2B4O7 (LBO) ionic networks construction are synchronously introduced into LRMO materials (LBO&#8208;LRMO) by mechanochemical and subsequent thermally driven diffusion method. Owing to the high binding energy of B&#9472;O and high&#8208;efficiency ionic networks of nanoscale LBO complex in cathode materials, the as&#8208;prepared LBO&#8208;LRMO displays highly reversible and activated anionic redox reactions in ASSBs. The designed LBO&#8208;LRMO interwoven structure enables robust phase and LBO&#8208;LRMO|solid electrolyte interface stability during cycling (over 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 C with a voltage range of 2.2&#8211;4.7&#160;V vs Li/Li+). This contribution affords a fundamental understanding of the anionic redox reactions for LRMO in ASSBs and offers an effective strategy to realize highly activated and reversible oxygen redox reactions in LRMO&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Adaptive In&#8208;Sensor Computing for Enhanced Feature Perception and Broadband Image Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phototransistor is introduced by leveraging the unique optoelectronic properties of two low&#8208;dimensional materials. The architecture enhances image perception and restoration quality, providing a robust solution for complex scenarios in machine vision. This innovative method facilitates the precise restoration of damaged images, offering significant potential for future advancements in sensor computing.








Abstract
Traditional imaging systems struggle in weak or complex lighting environments due to their fixed spectral responses, resulting in spectral mismatches and degraded image quality. To address these challenges, a bioinspired adaptive broadband image sensor is developed. This innovative sensor leverages a meticulously designed type&#8208;I heterojunction alignment of 0D perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and 2D black phosphorus (BP). This configuration enables efficient carrier injection control and advanced computing capabilities within an integrated phototransistor array. The sensor's unique responses to both visible and infrared (IR) light facilitate selective enhancement and precise feature extraction under varying lighting conditions. Furthermore, it supports real&#8208;time convolution and image restoration within a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network, effectively countering image degradation by capturing spectral features. Remarkably, the hardware responsivity weights perform comparably to software&#8208;trained weights, achieving an image restoration accuracy of over 85%. This approach offers a robust and versatile solution for machine vision applications that demand precise and adaptive imaging in dynamic lighting environments.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Polar Topologies in Oxide Ferroelectrics via Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large&#8208;scale polar flux&#8208;closure array from typical c/a domains are observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers, which is reversible after the removal of external electric fields. Phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate that the decrease of electrostatic energy is a main driving force in the transition of a/c to flux&#8208;closures.








Abstract
Polar topologies show great potentials in memories and other nano&#8208;micro devices. To integrate with silicon conducting circuits, it is vital to understand the dynamic evolution and the transformation of different domain configurations under external stimulus. Here in situ transmission electron microscopy is performed and the electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large&#8208;scale polar flux&#8208;closure array from typical c/a domains in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers is directly observed. It is found that the transformation is reversible after removal of external electric fields. Increasing external electric fields on (PbTiO3/SrTiO3)5 multilayered films, it is further found that the flux&#8208;closure domains are nucleated and propagated via the steps of first the formation of new c domains and then connection with neighboring c domains. The transition from a/c domains to flux&#8208;closure arrays under electric fields is collaborated with evaluating energy variations by phase&#8208;field simulations in which the electrostatic energy plays an important role. These results demonstrate the polar topologies can be reversibly manipulated by external stimuli, which sheds light on further understanding the dynamics behavior of polar topologies and helps for future nanoelectric applications.

         <title>Beyond Fundamental Building Blocks: Plasticity in Structurally Complex Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how the deformation behavior of intermetallics can be linked through their crystal's building blocks. By examining samarium&#8208;cobalt phases, it is found that their plasticity is not directly inherited from building blocks but is influenced by local bonding environments. These insights highlight the role of local bonding in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally complex intermetallics.








Abstract
Intermetallics, which encompass a wide range of compounds, often exhibit similar or closely related crystal structures, resulting in various intermetallic systems with structurally derivative phases. This study examines the hypothesis that deformation behavior can be transferred from fundamental building blocks to structurally related phases using the binary samarium&#8208;cobalt system. SmCo2 and SmCo5 are investigated as fundamental building blocks and compared them to the structurally related SmCo3 and Sm2Co17 phases. Nanoindentation and micropillar compression tests are performed to characterize the primary slip systems, complemented by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations via atomic&#8208;scale modeling. The results show that while elastic properties of the structurally complex phases follow a rule of mixtures, their plastic deformation mechanisms are more intricate, influenced by the stacking and bonding nature within the crystal's building blocks. These findings underscore the importance of local bonding environments in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally related intermetallics, providing crucial insights for the development of high&#8208;performance intermetallic&#160;materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research provides a significant breakthrough in the field of narrowband organic photodiodes (OPDs) by introducing a novel class of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN) single&#8208;component wavelength&#8208;selective materials. The OPDs incorporating these single&#8208;component BN photoabsorbers demonstrate record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 33.77% and small full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single&#8208;component photoabsorbers.

Organic photodiodes (OPDs) that utilize wavelength&#8208;selective absorbing molecules offer a direct approach to capturing specific wavelengths of light in multispectral sensors/imaging systems without filters. However, they exhibit broad response bandwidths, low external quantum efficiency (EQE), and often require compromises in two&#8208;component photoactive materials. Herein, the first utility of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN) single&#8208;component photoabsorbers, leveraging a multi&#8208;resonance effect are introduced to attain OPDs with both record&#8208;high EQE of 33.77% and ultra&#8208;small full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single&#8208;component photoabsorbers. It is found that the outstanding performance of these narrowband OPDs can be attributed to the ultra&#8208;small FWHM, slow charge recombination, low activation energy, and balanced bipolar charge transport within the para&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted B,N&#8208;embedded rigid polycyclic molecule (BNCz) film. Furthermore, BN derivatives such as BN(p)SCH3, BN(p)SO2CH3, and pyBN&#8208;m&#8208;H have also shown high EQE, minimal FWHM, and tunable photoresponse peaks ranging from blue&#8208;violet to blue&#8208;turquoise, highlighting the potential of BN molecules and molecular engineering in the development of novel narrowband absorbers for advanced wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs. Such pioneering working can provide a class of novel narrowband absorbers to propel the advancement of high&#8208;performance wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs.

         <title>Rigidity&#8208;Flexibility Regulation and Hard&#8208;Soft Donor Combination: Dual Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks Construction for Actinides/lanthanides Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual strategy for the design of covalent organic frameworks integrates molecular rigidity&#8211;flexibility regulation with hard&#8211;soft atom incorporation. The synthesized DAPhen&#8208;COF achieves over 95% removal of Np(V), Pu(IV), and Am(III), with a separation factor exceeding 5000 for Np/Gd. This study marks the first application of covalent organic frameworks in separating various transuraniums from lanthanides.








Abstract
Separating actinides from lanthanides is essential for managing nuclear waste and promoting sustainable nuclear energy development. The recycling of transuranium elements (TRUs: Np, Pu, Am) is also significant for various nuclear technology applications. In this study, a dual strategy is introduced to designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that skillfully combines molecular rigidity with flexibility, integrating both hard and soft donor atoms in the synthesis of monomers. This results in a specialized COF that efficiently and selectively captures TRUs from acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the topological arrangement of rigid ligands to influence the twisting and stretching of flexible ligands, coordination environment featuring nitrogen and oxygen is created, which enhances the separation of transuranium in various oxidation states over lanthanides. In 0.5&#160;m HNO3 solution, the as&#8208;synthesized DAPhen&#8208;COF achieves removal rates of 99.1% for Np(V) and 95.8% for Pu(IV). For Am(III), the removal rate reaches 98.6% in 0.01&#160;m HNO3. DAPhen&#8208;COF exhibits remarkable selectivity for Np(V), with a separation factor of over 5000 for Np/Gd, outperforming other solid&#8208;phase materials. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the design and synthesis of COFs for actinide capture, marking the first application of COFs in the separation of various TRUs over lanthanides.

         <title>Piezoelectric&#8208;Augmented Thermoelectric Ionogels for Self&#8208;Powered Multimodal Medical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionogel comprised of mobile ions and piezoelectric polymer matrices is characteristic of both piezoelectric and ionic thermoelectric attributes. The gel is capable of capturing heat, stress, and moisture from the environment and converting them into remarkably high voltage outputs, enabling acute sensing in clinic scenarios.








Abstract
A paradigm ionogel consisting of ionic liquid (IL) and PVDF&#8722;HFP composites is made, which inherently possesses dual&#8208;function ionic thermoelectric (iTE) and piezoelectric (PE) attributes. This study investigates an innovative &#8220;PE&#8208;enhanced iTEs&#8221; effect, wherein the ionic thermopower exhibits a 58% enhancement while the ionic conductivity arises more than 2&#215; within a PE&#8208;induced internal electric field. By harnessing these multifaceted features, fully self&#8208;powered, multimodal sensors demonstrate their superior energy conversion capabilities, which possessed minimum sensitivities of 0.13&#160;mV&#160;kPa&#8722;1 and 0.96&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 in pressure and temperature alterations, respectively. The PE augmentation of iTEs is maximized by &#8776;3&#215; under rising water pressure. Their swift and sophisticated responses to various in vivo vital signs simultaneously in a hemorrhagic shock scenario, indicative of good prospects in the clinical medicine field are showcased.

         <title>Fully Transparent and Distortion&#8208;Free Monotonically Stretchable Substrate by Nanostructure Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving monotonic transparent, stretchable substrates with near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio, this approach utilizes nanoscopic block copolymer alignment via shear&#8208;rolling. This alignment of nanostructures smaller than the wavelength of light yields a near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio (&#8776;0.07), eliminating vertical contraction and maintaining distortion&#8208;free performance under uniform strain across the entire area even under 50% strain, with excellent optical properties.








Abstract
Stretchable devices, garnering increasing attention as next&#8208;generation form factors, have a crucial problem in that vertical contraction occurs during stretching, causing image distortion of stretchable displays and discomfort in skin&#8208;attached devices. Previous structural strategies to mitigate vertical contraction, such as auxetic reentrants and wrinkles, suffer from the drawback that their structure becomes visible during stretching. In this study, this issue is addressed by unidirectionally aligning nanoscopic cylinders within block copolymer elastomer films. Employing a shear&#8208;rolling process at high temperatures on thick films of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyisobutylene&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene thermoplastic elastomers, macroscopic mechanical anisotropy is achieved, resulting in completely transparent and monotonically stretchable substrates devoid of vertical or depth distortion during deformation. Significantly, the unidirectional orientation of high&#8208;modulus cylindrical nanostructures induces macroscopic mechanical anisotropy with a modulus ratio exceeding five times. While the Poisson's ratio of conventional elastic materials hovers around &#8776;0.5, this mechanical anisotropy minimizes vertical contraction, yielding a Poisson's ratio below 0.07. Moreover, owing to the negligible size of the nanocylinders compared to visible&#8208;light wavelengths, the substrate can be monotonically uniaxially stretched while maintaining high transmittance without introducing distortions, surface undulations, or haziness, resulting in distortion&#8208;free stretchable substrates.

         <title>Unveiling Charge Carrier Dynamics at Organic&#8211;Inorganic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Interfaces: Insights From Advanced EPR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops TP/ZIS&#8208;10 S&#8208;scheme heterostructures, uncovers unique charge transfer dynamics via TR EPR, ISIXPS, and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, and provides novel insights into charge carrier dynamics at S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interfaces, paving the way for efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts for green energy conversion.








Abstract
Understanding charge carrier transfer at heterojunction interfaces is critical for advancing solar energy conversion technologies. This study utilizes continuous wave (CW), pulse, and time&#8208;resolved (TR) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to explore the radical species formed at the TAPA (tris(4&#8722;aminophenyl)amine)&#8208;PDA (Terephthaldicarboxaldehyde)/ZnIn2S4 (TP/ZIS) heterojunction interface. CW and pulse EPR identify stable radical defects localized near the interface, accessible to water molecules. Time&#8208;resolved EPR reveals a photoinduced electron transfer from TP to ZIS, leading to the generation of spin&#8208;correlated radical pairs under light irradiation, signifying efficient charge carrier separation and spatial transfer within the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This electron transfer mechanism, confirmed through in situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, suppresses undesirable carrier recombination, extending charge carrier lifetimes.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops TP/ZIS-10 S-scheme heterostructures, uncovers unique charge transfer dynamics via TR EPR, ISIXPS, and fs-TA spectroscopy, and provides novel insights into charge carrier dynamics at S-scheme heterojunction interfaces, paving the way for efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic S-scheme photocatalysts for green energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding charge carrier transfer at heterojunction interfaces is critical for advancing solar energy conversion technologies. This study utilizes continuous wave (CW), pulse, and time-resolved (TR) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to explore the radical species formed at the TAPA (tris(4&#8722;aminophenyl)amine)-PDA (Terephthaldicarboxaldehyde)/ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (TP/ZIS) heterojunction interface. CW and pulse EPR identify stable radical defects localized near the interface, accessible to water molecules. Time-resolved EPR reveals a photoinduced electron transfer from TP to ZIS, leading to the generation of spin-correlated radical pairs under light irradiation, signifying efficient charge carrier separation and spatial transfer within the S-scheme heterojunction. This electron transfer mechanism, confirmed through in situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, suppresses undesirable carrier recombination, extending charge carrier lifetimes. These findings provide novel insights into the transport direction of charge carriers at the S-scheme heterojunction interface, offering valuable guidance for designing highly efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts for solar energy applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Charge Separation Via Periodic Array Nanostructures for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a plasmonic photocatalyst with an ordered Au nanoparticle array on SrTiO3, enhancing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining constant resonant energy due to surface lattice resonance. This balance improves charge separation and increases local charge density at active sites, boosting water oxidation activity sevenfold. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for optimizing SPR characteristics to enhance photocatalytic performance on plasmonic platforms, opening avenues for more efficient energy conversion applications.








Abstract
Plasmonic resonance intensity in metallic nanostructures plays a crucial role in charge generation and separation, directly affecting plasmon&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity. Engineering strategies to enhance plasmonic effects involve designing specific nanostructures, such as triangular nanoplates with sharp corners or dimer nanostructures with hot spots. However, these approaches often lead to a trade&#8208;off between enhanced plasmonic intensity and resonance energy, which ultimately determines local charge density and photocatalytic performance. Here, inspired by theoretical predications, it is shown that a flexibly controlled plasmonic photocatalyst, consisting of an ordered array of Au nanoparticles on a SrTiO3 surface, exhibits an enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining a constant SPR resonant energy, due to the presence of surface lattice resonance. This trade&#8208;off results in improved charge separation efficiency and an increase in local charge density at catalytically active sites, as verified by theoretical simulations, surface photovoltage microscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, the optimized periodic photocatalyst shows a 7&#8208;fold increase in water oxidation activity over disordered nanostructures. This work provides a novel approach for balancing the intensity and energy of SPR, which will contribute to optimizing photocatalytic activity on plasmonic platforms.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal&#8211;Microfiber Interlocking Enables Highly Conductive and Strain&#8208;insensitive Metastructured Fibers for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic liquid metal&#8211;microfiber interlocking interface is proposed to develop a highly stable and conductive metastructured fiber, which shows remarkable conductivity of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, and maintains stable conductance with only a 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain. These fibers are demonstrated as versatile platforms for wearable temperature&#8208;visualizing electrothermal heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing&#8208;display fabrics.








Abstract
Stretchable fibers with high conductivity are vital components for smart textiles and wearable electronics. However, embedding solid conductive materials in polymers significantly reduces conductive pathways when stretched, causing a sharp drop in conductivity. Here, a stretchable metastructured fiber with dynamic liquid metal&#8211;microfiber interlocking interface is reported to realize highly conductive yet ultrastable conductance. The Cu&#8208;EGaIn mixture is partially embedded within the porous microfiber mat, thereby enabling its roll&#8208;up into a spiral&#8208;layered metastructured fiber with self&#8208;compensating conductive pathways. The metastructured fiber shows outstanding performance, including high conductivity of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, large stretchability up to 629%, and ultrastable conductance with only 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain, which far surpasses the theoretical value. Moreover, these fibers have served as versatile platforms for wearable temperature&#8208;visualizing electrothermal fiber heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing&#8208;display fabrics. This dynamic solid&#8211;liquid interfacial interlocking strategy is promising for stretchable electronics.

         <title>In Situ Metal Vacancy Filling in Stable Pd&#8208;Sn Intermetallic Catalyst for Enhanced C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;Sn intermetallic compound with Pd deficiency (Pd1.9&#8722;xSn, x = 0.06), enhanced by Sn incorporation from SnOx, demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation. The efficient dissociation of the C&#8211;C bond highlights its potential for energy conversion applications.








Abstract
A common challenge in electrochemical processes is developing high performance, stable catalysts for specific chemical reactions. In this work, a Pd&#8208;Sn intermetallic compound with &#160; Pd site deficiency (Pd1.9&#8722;xSn) (x = 0.06) and trace amount of SnOx was synthesised by controlled process. Under the electrochemical conditions, the deficient Pd site is filled by metallic Sn, which generates a highly active and stable (Pd1.84Sn0.06)Sn catalyst for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The crystal structure and atomic arrangements for synthesized and in situ generated compound are comprehensively characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ generated catalyst exhibits excellent performance toward EOR (anodic reaction in fuel cell), which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C catalyst by three times in terms of activity. Furthermore, it is observed that the catalyst preferentially cleaves the C&#63743;C bond in ethanol, which is a crucial process that enhances the efficiency of the fuel cells. The catalyst retains its superlative activity even after 1500 cycles of continuous operation. The mechanism for EOR and C&#63743;C bond cleavage is evidenced by operando Infra Red spectroscopy&#160;and Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy (DEMS), and the driving force toward excellent performance has been proposed via theoretical&#160;calculations.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Induced in Situ Phase Separation and Percolation for Constructing Bi&#8208;Continuous Phase Hydrogel Electrodes With Motion&#8208;Insensitive Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a one&#8208;step strategy to fabricate bi&#8208;continuous phase hydrogels under mild conditions. The resulting hydrogel exhibits excellent conductivity, elasticity, strain insensitivity, and biocompatibility. The hydrogel&#8208;based electrode facilitates motion&#8208;artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological signal monitoring and enables wireless, multimodal data acquisition under dynamic conditions. This cutting&#8208;edge technology offers potent tools for healthcare and medical management.








Abstract
Conducting&#160;polymer hydrogels have gained attention in the bioelectronics field due to their unique combination of biocompatibility and customizable mechanical properties. However, achieving both excellent conductivity and mechanical strength in a hydrogel remains a significant challenge, primarily because of the inherent conflict between the hydrophobic nature of conducting polymers and the hydrophilic characteristics of hydrogels. To address this issue, this work proposes a simple one&#8208;step acid&#8208;induced approach that not only promotes the gelation of hydrophilic polymers but also facilitates the in situ phase separation of hydrophobic conducting polymers under mild conditions. This results in a distinctive bi&#8208;continuous phase structure with exceptional electrical property (906 mS cm&#8722;1) and mechanical performance (fracture strain of 1103%). The hydrogel forms robust percolating networks that maintain structural integrity under mechanical stress due to their entropic elasticity, providing remarkable strain insensitivity, low mechanical hysteresis, and an impressive resilience (95%). Electrodes fabricated from the conductive hydrogel exhibit stable and minimal interfacial contact impedance with skin (1&#8211;6 kilohms at 1&#8211;100&#160;Hz) and significantly lower noise power (4.9 &#181;V2). This work believes that the motion&#8208;insensitive characteristics and mechanical robustness of this hydrogel will enable efficient and reliable monitoring of biological signals, establishing a new benchmark in the bioelectronics.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Performance Composite Epoxy Resins: Interfacial &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Interactions&#8208;Driven Physical Rolling Behavior of Silica Microspheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient energy transfer of rolling spheres based on the basic law of physics forms the basis of a novel strategy, wherein the 3 interface &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions induce the &#8220;rolling behavior&#8221; of microspheres. This approach mitigates local stress concentrations in composite epoxy resins, resulting in a synergistic enhancement of strength and toughness.








Abstract
The intrinsic compromise between strength and toughness in composite epoxy resins significantly constrains their practical applications. In this study, a novel strategy is introduced, leveraging interfacial &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions to induce the &#8220;rolling behavior&#8221; of microsphere fillers, thereby facilitating efficient energy dissipation. This approach is corroborated through theoretical simulations and experimental validation. The resulting composite epoxy resin demonstrates an impressive 49.8% enhancement in strength and a remarkable 358.9% improvement in toughness compared to conventional epoxy resins, accompanied by substantially reduced hysteresis. Moreover, this system achieves reversible closed&#8208;loop recyclability and rapid repair capabilities. The preliminary demonstration of &#8220;force&#8208;temperature equivalence&#8221; further establishes a novel pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance composite epoxy materials.

         <title>Chemomechanical Self&#8208;Oscillatory Microgel Motility in Stratified Chemical Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple design is illustrated for achieving prolonged and damped chemomechanical oscillations using a stimuli&#8208;responsive membrane&#8208;bound microgel within a stratified environment containing partitioned swelling and deswelling stimuli. The swelling and deswelling responses of the microgel in the bottom and top layers are coupled to buoyant motility via membrane&#8208;mediated displacement of the external media.








Abstract
The design of chemomechanical self&#8208;oscillators, which execute oscillations in the presence of constant stimuli lacking periodicity, is a step toward the development of autonomous and interactive soft robotic systems. This work presents a simple design of prolonged chemomechanical oscillatory movement in a microgel system capable of buoyant motility within stratified chemical media containing spatially localized sinking and floating stimuli. Three design elements are developed: a stimuli&#8208;responsive membranized calcium alginate microgel, a Percoll density gradient for providing stratified antagonistic chemical media, and transduction of microgel particle size actuation into buoyant motility via membrane&#8208;mediated displacement of the Percoll media. The presence of citrate or calcium ions in different layers of the Percoll media gives rise to swelling (buoyancy) or contraction (geotaxis), respectively, which in turn mediate the shuttling of the microgels between the layers to produce prolonged or damped chemomechanical oscillatory trajectories. The concentration&#8208;dependence of the oscillatory behavior in the stratified media, the density gap between the Percoll layers, and the kinetic asymmetry of microgel swelling and deswelling are studied. The illustrated modular design allows for the development of chemomechanical self&#8208;oscillators responsive to light, pH, or temperature, which will find applications in interactive soft robotics, autonomous microbots, and intelligent materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Capacitive Energy Storage Density at 150&#160;&#176;C Achieved in Polyetherimide Composite Films by Filler and Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacked structure design method of integrating inorganic fillers with high &#603;r, and PEI polymers with high breakdown strength is proposed. BNKT&#8208;BST dense ceramics are prepared by solid&#8208;phase reaction method, and BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposites are prepared by casting and hot&#8208;pressing method, which resulted in nanocomposites with excellent energy storage properties at high temperatures.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are crucial for electronic communications and industrial applications due to their high breakdown field strength (Eb), fast charge/discharge speed, and temperature stability. The upcoming electronic&#8208;electrical systems pose a significant challenge, necessitating polymeric dielectrics to exhibit exceptional thermal stability and energy storage capabilities at high temperatures. Here, ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant (&#603;r) and charge/discharge efficiency (&#951;) of 0.55Bi0.5(Na0.84K0.16)0.5TiO3&#8208;0.45(Bi0.1Sr0.85)TiO3 (BNKT&#8208;BST) ceramics are prepared by the solid&#8208;phase reaction method and added to polyetherimide (PEI) to form BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposites with various structures. The findings indicate that the sandwich&#8208;structured BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposite achieves the highest discharged energy density (Ud) of 7.7 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with &#951; of 80.2% when the Eb is 650 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C. This is primarily due to the incorporation of BNKT&#8208;BST nanoparticles and the multilayer structure design, which significantly improves the composite's &#603;r and Eb. Additionally, the sandwich&#8208;structured composites show excellent cycling stability at 500 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, with Ud of &#8776; 4.7 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and &#951; greater than 90%. The research presents nanocomposites with high energy storage density and excellent stability, crucial for the practical application of polymer dielectrics in high&#8208;temperature environments.

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Afterglow Emission in Polymeric Phosphors via Inverse Opal Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust method is presented for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by incorporating a supporting layer of inverse opal photonic structures. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical modulation of afterglow in polymeric phosphors and position the resulting Janus film for potential applications in biosensing and information storage.








Abstract
Tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors is critical for advancing their use in optical data storage and display technologies. Despite advancements in polymer matrix design and dopant engineering, achieving dynamic control over afterglow intensity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel approach is introduced for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by integrating them into an inverse opal photonic structure. By precisely aligning the photonic stopband of the inverse opal structure with the afterglow band of the polymer film, a remarkable 15&#8208;fold enhancement in afterglow intensity is achieved. This enhancement is tunable, decreasing from 15 to 1.2 by infiltrating the photonic structure with media of varying refractive indices ranging from 1.00 (air) to 1.37 (ethyl acetate). The tunability arises from reducing the mismatch between the stopband and the afterglow band, as the weighted refractive index shifts between 1.15 and 1.40. Additionally, the inverse opal photonic structure induces angle&#8208;dependent structural colors in the Janus polymeric phosphors, modulated by the refractive index of the infiltrating media. This integration of dynamically tunable afterglow with angle&#8208;dependent structural coloration unlocks new potential for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Efficiency Boost in Through Space Charge Transfer Emitters: Insights from Spiro Lateral Rocking Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterical aryl immobilizing groups are incorporated (phenyl and pyridine) at the C8 site of the rigid fluorene spacer. These immobilizing groups restrict both rotational and rocking motions. The completely confined conformation demonstrates enhanced TADF performance.








Abstract
Intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This study addresses the challenges in tuning excited state dynamics through conformational engineering, which significantly impacts exciton utilization. An effective strategy is presented to enhance the performance of TSCT&#8208;TADF molecules by restricting the lateral rocking of the spiro unit via immobilizing groups, which indirectly adjusts the conformations of the donor and acceptor subunits. This approach is successfully illustrated with two TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters, 8PhDM&#8208;B and 8PyDM&#8208;B, featuring sterical aryl phenyl and pyridine substitutions at the C8 site of a rigid spiro&#8208;fluorene bridge. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing these emitters demonstrated impressive maximum external quantum efficiencies of 33.1% and 31.0%, respectively. The findings underscore the importance of the rocking confined strategy in refining excited state dynamics, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of highly efficient OLED emitters.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Analysis of Local Nascent Protein Deposition in 3D Microenvironments via Extracellular Protein Identification Cytometry (EPIC)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge of the extracellular matrix drives the understanding of cell behavior. However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) guides cell behavior and tissue fate. Cell populations are notoriously heterogeneous leading to large variations in cell behavior at the single&#8208;cell level. Although insights into population heterogeneity are valuable for fundamental biology, regenerative medicine, and drug testing, current ECM analysis techniques only provide either averaged population&#8208;level data or single&#8208;cell data from a limited number of cells. Here, extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) is presented as a novel platform technology that enables high&#8208;throughput measurements of local nascent protein deposition at single&#8208;cell level. Specifically, human primary chondrocytes are microfluidically encapsulated in enzymatically crosslinked microgels of 16 picoliter at kHz rates, forming large libraries of discrete 3D single&#8208;cell microniches in which ECM can be deposited. ECM proteins are labeled using fluorescence immunostaining to allow for nondestructive analysis via flow cytometry. This approach reveals population heterogeneity in matrix deposition at unprecedented throughput, allowing for the identification and fluorescent activated cell sorting&#8208;mediated isolation of cellular subpopulations. Additionally, it is demonstrated that inclusion of a second cell into microgels allows for studying the effect of cell&#8208;cell contact on matrix deposition. In summary, EPIC enables high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of nascent proteins in 3D microenvironments, which is anticipated to advance fundamental knowledge and tissue engineering applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Luminescent Imaging&#8208;Based 3D QR Cube Platform for Spatial Information Storage and Security</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 3D quick response (QR) cube platform leverages true 3D space for significantly increased information storage and advanced multi&#8208;level encryption using spatial keys for enhanced security. A near&#8208;infrared&#160;imaging system enables noise&#8208;free images, allowing precise and detailed analysis of the 3D QR cube structure. A convolutional neural network&#8208;based 3D reconstruction model is developed, achieving consistently high prediction accuracy.








Abstract
The growing significance of information technology requires advanced information storage and security solutions. While extending traditional 2D&#160;codes with additional parameters has led to promising 3D codes, increasing information capacity and security remains challenging. Herein, a 3D quick response (QR) cube platform that utilizes near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;NIR upconversion nanoparticles as light&#8208;emitting probes, benefiting from their photostability and low scattering properties. These features enable precise reconstruction of the 3D QR cube. The platform employs volumetric space for information encoding by leveraging spatial information in a 3D environment, demonstrating potential to significantly increase information capacity and facilitate access from all three spatial dimensions (x, y, z), while enhancing security. This study develops a platform for analyzing and reconstructing 3D QR cubes using NIR imaging and employs a convolutional neural network model to determine the 3D structure from image intensity variations, achieving 99.9% accuracy in predicting cube configurations. By leveraging 3D spatial information and logical circuits, the encryption method has the potential to significantly surpass the encryption strength of traditional 2D codes. The findings demonstrate high prediction accuracy and introduce new possibilities for multi&#8208;level encryption with spatial security keys in 3D space, offering a robust solution for advanced information storage and security.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulating the Surface, Interface, and Bulk via Phosphating Modification for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and effective &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; modification strategy is exploited to achieve cooperative enhancements across the surface, interface, and bulk phase. This strategy provides a comprehensive understanding of reversible and irreversible characteristics of oxygen redox processes, offering theoretical guidance and experimental evidence for enhancing anionic redox reversibility and designing high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) are regarded as the leading cathode materials to overcome the bottleneck of higher energy density. Nevertheless, they encounter significant challenges, including voltage decay, poor cycle stability, and inferior rate performance, primarily due to irreversible oxygen release, transition metal dissolution, and sluggish transport kinetics. Moreover, traditionally single modification strategies do not adequately address these issues. Herein, an innovative &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; modification strategy is developed, simultaneously regulating the surface, interface, and bulk via an in&#8208;situ gas&#8211;solid interface phosphating reaction to create P&#8208;doped Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2@Spinel@Li3PO4. Specifically, Li3PO4 surface coating layer shields particles from electrolyte corrosion and enhances Li+ diffusion; in&#8208;situ constructed spinel interfacial layer reduces phase distortion and suppresses the lattice strain; the strong P&#9472;O bond derived from P&#8208;doping stabilizes the lattice oxygen frame and inhibits the release of O2, thereby improving the reversibility of oxygen redox reaction. As a result, the phosphatized LRMO demonstrates an exceptional capacity retention of 82.1% at 1C after 300 cycles (compared to 50.8% for LRMO), an outstanding rate capability of 170.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5C (vs 98.9 mAh g&#8722;1 for LRMO), along with excellent voltage maintenance and thermostability. Clearly, this &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; modification strategy offers a novel approach for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Orbital Coupling of Dual&#8208;Atom Sites Boosts Electrocatalytic NO Oxidation and Dynamic Intracellular Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed for the precise fabrication of orbital&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;atomic sites, which aims to enhance the affinity between the Ni sites and NO within Co1Ni1&#8208;NC. This strategy is specifically designed to significantly boost the performance of the NO oxidation reaction, contributing to advancements in the field of single&#8208;cell in situ monitoring of NO.









Abstract
In situ measurement of nitric oxide (NO) in living tissue and single cells is highly important for achieving a profound comprehension of cellular functionalities and facilitating the precise diagnosis of critical diseases; however, the progress is greatly hindered by the weak affinity of ultratrace concentration NO in cellular environment toward electrocatalysts. Herein, a new strategy is reported for precisely constructing orbital coupled dual&#8208;atomic sites to enhance the affinity between the metal atomic sites and NO on a class of N&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix dual&#8208;atomic sites Co&#9472;Ni (Co1Ni1&#8208;NC) for greatly boosting electrocatalytic NO performance. The as&#8208;synthesized Co1Ni1&#8208;NC demonstrates a substantially higher current density than Ni1&#8208;NC and Co1&#8208;NC, coupled with exceptional stability with a negligible degradation rate of 0.6 &#181;A&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1, which is the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO oxidation. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively reveal that the pivotal role of d&#8208;d orbit coupling between Co and Ni sites enables Ni to acquire additional electrons, leading to the occupation of Ni's 3dxy/yz within the 2&#960; orbitals of NO, thus weakening the N&#8801;O triple bond and concurrently accelerating NO adsorption kinetics. It is demonstrated that Co1Ni1&#8208;NC&#8208;coated nanoelectrode can achieve the in situ sensing of NO in living organs and single cells.

         <title>Reinforcing Gelatin Hydrogels via In Situ Phase Separation and Enhanced Interphase Bonding for Advanced 3D Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel gelatin hydrogel through microstructural optimization. The resulting hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical properties compared to conventional methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) gels while preserving key benefits like rapid gelation, cell adhesion, and complete biodegradability. These combined properties significantly enhance the precision and complexity of gelatin hydrogels for 3D printing and their applications in biomedicine.








Abstract
Gelatin hydrogels (e.g., methacrylated gelatin gel, abbreviated GelMA gel) have garnered significant attention in tissue engineering and therapeutic drug and cell delivery due to their complete degradability and intrinsic ability to support cell adhesion. However, their practical applications are often constrained by their poor mechanical performance, which stems from their single network structure. This limitation poses significant challenges in load&#8208;bearing scenarios and restricts their use in advanced biofabrication technologies, where robust mechanical properties are essential. Here a hydrogel is developed composed entirely of gelatin using a phototriggered transient&#8208;radical and persistent&#8208;radical coupling (PTPC) reaction to achieve an optimized microstructure. This hydrogel features a phase&#8208;separated structure with enhanced interfacial bonding, significantly improving mechanical performance compared to conventional GelMA gels. Notably, this approach preserves the inherent properties of gelatin, including biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and degradability, thereby extending its applicability in the biomedical field, particularly in advanced biofabrication methods such as 3D printing. This approach offers a superior solution to meet the complex demands of sophisticated biomanufacturing technologies, expanding the potential applications of gelatin hydrogels in the biomedical field.

         <title>Giant Ultrabroadband Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Engendered by Two&#8208;Photon Absorption in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Chiral Terahertz Wave Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports giant ultrabroadband two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) driven bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 utilizing wavelength&#8208;tunable terahertz emission spectroscopy. Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 outperforms standard terahertz emitters like p&#8208;InAs, enabling efficient chiral terahertz wave emission with tunable orientation and ellipticity. The work highlights TPA&#8208;induced BPVE in narrow&#8208;bandgap ferroelectrics supports high&#8208;performance BPVE devices and guides chiral THz wave design.








Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) can break the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit by leveraging the inherent asymmetry of crystal lattice without a junction. However, this effect is mainly confined to UV&#8211;vis spectrum due to the wide&#8208;bandgap nature of traditional ferroelectric materials, thereby limiting the exploration of the infrared light&#8208;driven efficient BPVE. Herein, giant two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) driven BPVE is uncovered from visible to infrared in ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 utilizing wavelength&#8208;tunable terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy. Remarkably, &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 exhibits exceptional THz emission efficiency in the infrared region, surpassing renowned THz emitters like p&#8208;InAs and achieving an efficiency approximately eight times the magnitude of standard ZnTe. The power exponent&#8208;type pump fluence and quadruple polarization features reveal a unique TPA&#8208;driven BPVE, corroborated by a fourth&#8208;order nonlinear oscillator model. Notably, TPA&#8208;engendered BPVE efficiency approaches 68% of that observed in the single&#8208;photon absorption process. Moreover, the TPA responses display clear polarization anisotropy, with considerably relative phase and amplitude driven by synchronous in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization, leading to chiral THz waves with high efficiency, tunable orientation, and controllable ellipticity. This work highlights the advantages of TPA&#8208;induced BPVE responses in narrow&#8208;bandgap ferroelectric semiconductors, enhancing spectral utilization efficiency, aiding high&#8208;performance devices based on BPVE, and guiding chiral THz wave design.

This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies. When neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of stroke&#8208;affected rats, it significantly reduces the brain infarct area, promotes synaptic reorganization, and restores motor functions and balance.









Abstract
Implantable neural probes hold promise for acquiring brain data, modulating neural circuits, and treating various brain disorders. However, traditional implantable probes face significant challenges in practical applications, such as balancing sensitivity with biocompatibility and the difficulties of in situ neural information monitoring and neuromodulation. To address these challenges, this study developed an implantable hydrogel probe capable of recording neural signals, modulating neural circuits, and treating stroke. Amylopectin is integrated into the hydrogels, which can induce reorientation of the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) chain and create compliant interfaces with brain tissues, enhancing both sensitivity and biocompatibility. The hydrogel probe shows the capability of continuously recording deep brain signals for 8 weeks. The hydrogel probe is effectively utilized to study deep brain signals associated with various physiological activities. Neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of rats, enabling control over their limb behaviors through evoked signals. When applied to the primary motor cortex of stroke&#8208;affected rats, neuromodulation significantly reduced the brain infarct area, promoted synaptic reorganization, and restored motor functions and balance. This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies.

         <title>Programmable Morphology&#8208;Adaptive Peptide Nanoassembly for Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, morphologically adaptive nanomaterial, FeFKC, is developed as an efficient delivery system for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Through pH&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;shifting, FeFKC enhances endocytosis, lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial localization, significantly boosting its catalytic impact. It suppressed tumors by up to 95% without evident safety concerns in mouse models, indicating broad potential for future targeted therapies.








Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy holds significant promise in cancer treatment by exploiting the high oxidative stress within tumor cells. However, efficiently delivering nanocatalytic agents to tumor tissues and maximizing their catalytic activity in situ remain critical challenges. Morphology&#8208;adaptive delivery systems, capable of adjusting their physical form in response to physiological conditions, offer unique spatiotemporal control for navigating complex biological environments like the tumor microenvironment. While designing systems that undergo multiple shape transformations often involves complex stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanisms, making programmable responses through simple designs highly desirable yet challenging. Here, FeFKC, an innovative adaptive material is introduced that achieves multi&#8208;step morphological transformations at the tissue level and amplifies catalytic activity through a straightforward design. As the microenvironmental pH decreases during drug delivery, FeFKC dynamically transitions between single chains, nanoparticles, and nanofibers. This programmable shape&#8208;shifting facilitates deep tumor penetration, enhanced cellular uptake, and lysosomal escape, significantly improving its catalytic efficiency in nanocatalytic tumor therapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that FeFKC achieves impressive tumor suppression efficacy of up to 95% without notable biosafety concerns. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive nanomaterials with programmable shape&#8208;transforming capabilities to overcome biological barriers and enhance catalytic therapy, opening new avenues for cancer treatment and other complex diseases.

     alt="Programmable Morphology-Adaptive Peptide Nanoassembly for Enhanced Catalytic Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A programmable, morphologically adaptive nanomaterial, FeFKC, is developed as an efficient delivery system for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Through pH-triggered shape-shifting, FeFKC enhances endocytosis, lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial localization, significantly boosting its catalytic impact. It suppressed tumors by up to 95% without evident safety concerns in mouse models, indicating broad potential for future targeted therapies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocatalytic therapy holds significant promise in cancer treatment by exploiting the high oxidative stress within tumor cells. However, efficiently delivering nanocatalytic agents to tumor tissues and maximizing their catalytic activity in situ remain critical challenges. Morphology-adaptive delivery systems, capable of adjusting their physical form in response to physiological conditions, offer unique spatiotemporal control for navigating complex biological environments like the tumor microenvironment. While designing systems that undergo multiple shape transformations often involves complex stimuli-responsive mechanisms, making programmable responses through simple designs highly desirable yet challenging. Here, FeFKC, an innovative adaptive material is introduced that achieves multi-step morphological transformations at the tissue level and amplifies catalytic activity through a straightforward design. As the microenvironmental pH decreases during drug delivery, FeFKC dynamically transitions between single chains, nanoparticles, and nanofibers. This programmable shape-shifting facilitates deep tumor penetration, enhanced cellular uptake, and lysosomal escape, significantly improving its catalytic efficiency in nanocatalytic tumor therapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that FeFKC achieves impressive tumor suppression efficacy of up to 95% without notable biosafety concerns. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive nanomaterials with programmable shape-transforming capabilities to overcome biological barriers and enhance catalytic therapy, opening new avenues for cancer treatment and other complex diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Switchable Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry Phases in Heterogeneously Integrated THz Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative structural design and integration scheme is proposed that utilizes vanadium dioxide, a phase&#8208;change material, to achieve thermally controlled dynamic PB phase control within the metasurface. By leveraging the material's properties, this can dynamically alter the optical orientation of individual elements of the metasurface and achieve temperature&#8208;dependent local phase modulation based on the geometric phase principle.








Abstract
The Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry (PB) phase has revolutionized the design of metasurfaces, offering a straightforward and robust method for controlling wavefronts of electromagnetic waves. However, traditional metasurfaces have fixed PB phases determined by the orientation of their individual elements. In this study, an innovative structural design and integration scheme is proposed that utilizes vanadium dioxide, a phase&#8208;change material, to achieve thermally controlled dynamic PB phase control within the metasurface. By leveraging the material's properties, this can dynamically alter the optical orientation of individual elements of the metasurface and achieve temperature&#8208;dependent local phase modulation based on the geometric phase principle. This approach, combined with advanced fabrication processing technology, paves the way for next&#8208;generation dynamic devices with customizable functions.

         <title>Tough Polyurethane Hydrogels with a Multiple Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Interlocked Bicontinuous Phase Structure Prepared by In Situ Water&#8208;Induced Microphase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough polyurethane hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure are prepared by in situ water&#8208;induced microphase separation. The outstanding mechanical performances endow the hydrogels with the capability to resist abdominal pressure and prevent hernia formation in vivo.








Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical performances similar to load&#8208;bearing tissues are in demand for in vivo applications. In this work, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly behavior of amphiphilic polymers, polyurethane&#8208;based tough hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure through in situ water&#8208;induced microphase separation strategy are developed, in which poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polyurethane (PEG&#8208;PU, hydrophilic) and poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8208;based polyurethane (PCL&#8208;PU, hydrophobic) are blended to form dry films followed by water swelling. A multiple hydrogen bonding factor, imidazolidinyl urea, is introduced into the synthesis of the two polyurethanes, and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between PEG&#8208;PU and PCL&#8208;PU can promote homogeneous microphase separation for the construction of bicontinuous phase structures in the hydrogel network, by which the hydrogel features break strength of 12.9 MPa, fracture energy of 2435 J m&#8722;2, and toughness of 48.2 MJ m&#8722;3. As a biomedical patch, the outstanding mechanical performances can withstand abdominal pressure to prevent hernia formation in the abdominal wall defect model. Compared to the commercial PP mesh, hydrogel can prevent tissue/organ adhesion to reduce inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis, thereby accelerating the repair of abdominal wall defects. This work may provide useful inspiration for researchers to design different gel materials through solvent&#8208;induced microphase separation.

         <title>A Rapidly Assembled and Camouflage&#8208;Monitoring&#8208;protection Integrated Modular Unit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The camouflage&#8208;monitoring&#8208;protection triune integrated modular unit achieves remarkable optical&#8208;microwave compatibility, which is instructed by machine learning and further assembled into a programmable array, exhibiting extraordinary programmability, multi&#8208;scenario adaptability, fast responsiveness, and long&#8208;life durability. The approach paves the universal way for optical&#8208;electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics&#8208;deviceization systematization.








Abstract
Optical&#8208;electromagnetic compatible devices are urgently required in intelligent building monitors and cross&#8208;band protection. Meanwhile, the insufficient systematicness and semi&#8208;empirical attempts significantly limit the prosperity of cross&#8208;band materials, causing enormous challenges for deviceization and material database construction. Herein, the systematical component&#8208;deviceization&#8208;machine learning prediction&#8208;array construction strategy is attempted to solve the bottleneck issues. A luminance&#8208;triggered camouflage&#8208;monitoring&#8208;protection triune integrated modular unit (IMU) is hierarchically encapsulated to simultaneously achieve efficient anti&#8208;electromagnetic interference (EMI), light&#8208;absorbing, quick gradient&#8208;colorization response. Moreover, an illumination intensity dataset and a surrogate model based on fully connected neural network fitting (FCNN&#8208;fitting) are constructed, which accurately predicts the light&#8208;absorbing property of IMUs and can be instructional for material selection. The IMUs are specifically assembled into a 4*4 array, aiming at multi&#8208;scenario application of programmable display, camouflage pattern, surface conformality, and rapid replaceability. This work paves the path and provides a promising strategy for optical&#8208;electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics&#8208;deviceization&#8208;array systematization.

         <title>Engineered Bacteria Manipulate Cysteine Metabolism to Boost Ferroptosis&#8208;Based Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metabolism&#8208;engineered bacterium inspired by sulfur&#8208;metabolizing bacteria is developed, functioning as a live drug that efficiently and precisely depletes the substrate cysteine, thereby completely blocking cysteine metabolism. This disruption dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach to treating PDAC by exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities with living engineered bacteria.









Abstract
Cysteine metabolism is a key determinant of the defense against ferroptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Blocking cysteine metabolism may trigger potent ferroptosis in PDAC cells by generating lipid peroxides during tumor metabolic processes. However, current methods to limit cysteine availability fall short, failing to efficiently block cysteine metabolism due to inadequate tumor targeting and compensatory cysteine sources. Inspired by sulfur&#8208;metabolizing bacteria, synthetic biology to develop an engineered bacterium capable of directly depleting cysteine to block its metabolism is used. Acting as a living drug, these engineered bacteria colonize the tumor and continuously produce engineered cyst(e)inase enzyme (CGL) under the stimulation of tumor hypoxia. The CGL exhausts the substrate cysteine, completely impeding cysteine metabolism. This process dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves efficient treatment. The results demonstrate that engineered bacteria designed for cysteine metabolism modulation possess unparalleled advantages in efficacy, persistence, and precision in blocking cysteine metabolism, making them highly suitable for effective ferroptosis treatment of PDAC.

         <title>Enhanced Synaptic Memory Window and Linearity in Planar In2Se3 Ferroelectric Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D vdW &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323; is used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction in a planar structure with Au electrodes. The interface between the &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323; semiconductor and the Au electrode is studied to achieve a large on/off ratio by inserting a SiO&#8322; insulating barrier. The polarization of &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323; gradually changes with the applied pulses, mimicking synaptic properties and exhibiting linear LTP/LTD behavior.








Abstract
A synaptic memristor using 2D ferroelectric junctions is a promising candidate for future neuromorphic computing with ultra&#8208;low power consumption, parallel computing, and adaptive scalable computing technologies. However, its utilization is restricted due to the limited operational voltage memory window and low on/off current (ION/OFF) ratio of the memristor devices. Here, it is demonstrated that synaptic operations of 2D In2Se3 ferroelectric junctions in a planar memristor architecture can reach a voltage memory window as high as 16&#160;V (&#177;8 V) and ION/OFF ratio of 108, significantly higher than the current literature values. The power consumption is 10&#8722;5&#160;W at the on state, demonstrating low power usage while maintaining a large ION/OFF ratio of 108 compared to other ferroelectric devices. Moreover, the developed ferroelectric junction mimicked synaptic plasticity through pulses in the pre&#8208;synapse. The nonlinearity factors are obtained 1.25 for LTP, &#8722;0.25 for LTD, respectively. The single&#8208;layer perceptron (SLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) on&#8208;chip training results in an accuracy of up to 90%, compared to the 91% in an ideal synapse device. Furthermore, the incorporation of a 3&#160;nm thick SiO2 interface between the &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 and the Au electrode resulted in ultrahigh performance among other 2D ferroelectric junction devices to date.

         <title>Highly Oriented WS2 Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale, highly oriented (almost monocrystalline) WS2 monolayers are synthesized on C/A&#8208;plane sapphire substrates by chemical vapor deposition. A record high saturation current density of 675&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved based on field&#8208;effect transistors made of such films, outperforming the index required for high&#8208;density integration circuits in IRDS 2025.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent the most promising channel materials for post&#8208;silicon microelectronics due to their unique structure and electronic properties. However, it remains challenging to synthesize wide&#8208;bandgap TMDCs monolayers featuring large areas and high performance simultaneously. Herein, highly oriented WS2 monolayers are reproducibly synthesized through a templated growth strategy on vicinal C/A&#8208;plane sapphire wafers. Various spectroscopic characterizations confirm the high crystallographic orientation and uniformity across the entire wafers. Electronic measurements for samples transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates reveal high average field&#8208;effect mobilities of 62 and 180 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at room temperature and 8 K, respectively. On hexagonal boron nitride substrates, these mobilities increase to 94 and 473 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, respectively. A record high saturation current density of 675&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is observed, outperforming the index required for high&#8208;density integration circuits in IRDS 2025. This work paves the way for the application of wide&#8208;bandgap TMDC monolayers in post&#8208;silicon electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Green and Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by CdZnSe/ZnS Core/Shell Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis strategy for CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell colloidal quantum wells, which covers the green and blue spectral range and exhibits exceptional photoelectric properties, is achieved by direct cation exchange from Cd to Zn and hot&#8208;injection shell growth. This enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance green and blue light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak external quantum efficiencies of 20.4% and 10.6%.








Abstract
The unique anisotropic properties of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make them highly promising as components in nanocrystal&#8208;based devices. However, the limited performance of green and blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions are tailored via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot&#8208;injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled the successful fabrication green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution&#8208;processed CQW&#8208;LEDs. The devices demonstrated a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (20.4% for green and 10.6% for blue), accompanied by a maximum brightness 347,683&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for green and 38,063&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for blue. The high&#8208;performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. This work provides a comprehensive synthesis strategy for enhancing the efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs utilizing anisotropic nanocrystals.

         <title>Photonic Supercoupling in Silicon Topological Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for the first time, enabling efficient waveguide coupling over separation distances ranging from sub&#8208;wavelength to multiple wavelengths, driven by the valley vortex wave in the topological valley Hall system. This approach aims at integrating increasing number of on&#8208;chip components to further enhance the chip compactness and density.








Abstract
Waveguide interconnect coupling control is essential for enhancing the chip density of photonic integrated circuits to incorporate a growing number of components. However, a critical engineering challenge is to achieve both strong waveguide isolation and efficient long&#8208;range coupling on a single chip. Here, a novel photonic supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for waveguide coupling over separation distances from a quarter to five wavelengths (&#955;), leveraging the tunable mode tails and the vortex energy flow in topological valley Hall system. A supercoupled integrated chip is developed, realizing a 91% coupling ratio and a &#8722;30&#160;dB isolation over 2.8&#955; waveguide separations simultaneously. Supercoupled devices are further showcased including a waveguide&#8208;cavity system with 3.2&#955; excitation distance, and a waveguide directional supercoupler with a compact coupling area of nearly &#955;2/4, which outperform conventional devices. Supercoupling provides new degrees of freedom for optimizing coupling and isolation between photonic integrated components, facilitating new applications in on&#8208;chip sensing, lasing, and telecommunications.

         <title>Quinoidal Semiconductor Nanoparticles for NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging and Photoimmunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly developed nanopolymer, constructed from quinoidal acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) structured organic molecules, exhibits excellent near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light absorption, phototherapy, and photoacoustic imaging performance. Combined with the immunomodulator R848, it efficiently treats primary ovarian tumors, inhibits metastatic tumors, and also demonstrates promising efficacy in breast cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photoagents with ultra&#8208;high near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light energy conversion efficiency hold great promise in tumor phototherapy due to their ability to penetrate deeper tissues and minimize damage to surrounding healthy cells. However, the development of NIR&#8208;II photoagents remain challenging. In this study, an all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring quinoidal acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) molecule, SKCN, with a BTP core is synthesized, and nanoparticles named FA&#8208;SNPs are prepared. The unique quinoidal structure enhances &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization and bond length uniformity, significantly reducing the bandgap of SKCN, resulting in strong NIR&#8208;II absorption, a high molar extinction coefficient, and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 75.14%. Enhanced molecular rigidity also facilitates efficient energy transfer to oxygen, boosting reactive oxygen species generation. By incorporating the immunomodulator R848, FA&#8208;SRNPs nanoparticles are further developed, effectively modulating the tumor immune microenvironment by reducing Tregs and M&#8208;MDSCs infiltration, promoting dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and activating CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Comprehensive studies using orthotopic ovarian cancer models demonstrated strong tumor targeting, photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and significant tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition, and also showing excellent therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic breast cancer model. This study provides strong evidence for the potential application of quinoidal A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules in cancer photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>A Universal Solid&#8208;Phase Synthetic Strategy for Ultrafine Intermetallic Libraries Confined in Ordered Mesoporous Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript reports a solid&#8208;phase route to prepare ultrafine intermetallic libraries confined in ordered mesoporous carbon by a strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates. The intermetallic catalyst discloses remarkably high activity and stability in oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Ordered intermetallic nanocatalysts supported on high&#8208;surface&#8208;area skeletons are of great importance in catalysis and have disclosed notable catalytic activity and stability that are remarkably better than their random alloy counterparts. Ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts are synthetically challenging, especially for universal and scaled&#8208;up synthesis, because of inevitable sintering and phase separation under high temperatures that promote atomic alloying and ordering. Herein, a universal solid&#8208;phase and scaled&#8208;up method is reported for synthesizing ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts with uniform size distributions and wide compositional spaces confined in ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) supports, where the strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates remarkably suppress the high&#8208;temperature sintering and phase separation even up to 1000&#160;&#176;C. Libraries of intermetallic nanocatalysts are successfully synthesized including 52 combinations of host platinum/palladium/rhodium with 15 guest elements confined in 4 OMC supports. Taking oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions as examples, the intermetallic PtFe nanocatalysts hold remarkable performance, whose activities reach up to ten times higher than commercial Pt/C and also are comparable to the best electrocatalysts reported recently. This feasible synthetic strategy offers an intermetallic library spanning from binary to senary materials for industrial synthesis and applications.

         <title>Nanozymes and Their Potential Roles in the Origin of Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes, as enzyme mimics, demonstrate not only enzyme&#8208;like structures and activities but also high stability and regulated catalytic functions. Minerals are also known for catalytic roles in the origin of life. Building on this foundation, this study proposes that nanozymes may serve as highly efficient pre&#8208;enzymatic catalysts, potentially participating in the transition from inorganic molecules to primitive cells in chemical evolution.









Abstract
The origin of life has long been a central scientific challenge, with various hypotheses proposed. The chemical evolution, which supposes that inorganic molecules can transform into organic molecules and subsequent primitive cells, laid the foundation for modern theories. Inorganic minerals are believed to play crucial catalytic roles in the process. However, the harsh reaction conditions of inorganic minerals hinder the accumulation of organic molecules, preventing the efficient transition from inorganic molecules to biomacromolecules. Given the inherent physicochemical properties and enzyme&#8208;like activities, this study proposes that nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, act as efficient prebiotic catalysts in the origin of life. This hypothesis is based on the following: First, unlike traditional minerals, nanominerals can catalyze organic synthesis under milder conditions. Second, nanominerals can not only protect biomolecules from radiation damage but also catalyze polymerization reactions to form functional biomacromolecules and further lipid vesicles. More importantly, nanominerals are abundant in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. This perspective will systematically discuss the potential roles of nanozymes in the emergence of life based on the functions of minerals and the characteristics of nanozymes. We hope the research on nanozymes and the origin of life will bridge the gap between inorganic precursors and biomolecules under primitive environments.

         <title>Low&#8208;Volatility Fused&#8208;Ring Solid Additive Engineering for Synergistically Elongating Exciton Lifetime and Mitigating Trap Density Toward Organic Solar Cells of 20.5% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
3,6&#8208;dibromothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low&#8208;volatility fused&#8208;ring solid additive to elucidate the mechanism of photovoltaic performance. The integrated theoretical and experimental study reveals that 3,6TTBr's rigid, planar molecules interact with the terminal units of L8&#8208;BO, facilitating spacing for neighboring molecules. To validate the broader applicability of the findings, 1,5&#8208;dibromonaphthalene (1,5&#8208;BN) is examined, achieving a notable PCE of 20.5%.








Abstract
Volatile solid additives (VSAs) with single or fused&#8208;ring structures have attracted much attention for enhancing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of organic solar cells (OSCs). While the working mechanisms of high&#8208;volatility single&#8208;ring additives have been well studied, the influence of low&#8208;volatility fused&#8208;ring VSAs on molecular aggregations and exciton/carrier dynamics remains still unclear. Herein, 3,6&#8208;dibromothieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (3,6TTBr) is selected as a representative low&#8208;volatility fused&#8208;ring VSA to elucidate its working mechanism. Via the theoretical and experimental joint investigation, it is found that rigid and planar 3,6TTBr molecules adsorb onto the terminal units of L8&#8208;BO (acceptor), inducing loose space for adjacent molecules. The low&#8208;volatility 3,6TTBr thus favors the L8&#8208;BO center&#8208;terminal packing with a larger interfragment distance, which relieves the L8&#8208;BO over&#8208;aggregation and induces the ordered packing. Consequently, the 3,6TTBr treatment reduces aggregation&#8208;caused quenching, enhancing the photoluminescence quantum yield and exciton lifetime of L8&#8208;BO film. The combination of the above properties with the reduced trap density and improved carrier transport in the 3,6TTBr&#8208;treated devices contributed to PCE of 20.1%. To validate the broad applicability of the findings, 1,5&#8208;dibromonaphthalene (1,5&#8208;BN), another low&#8208;volatility fused&#8208;ring solid, is explored. The devices with 1,5&#8208;BN achieved an impressive PCE of 20.5%, verifying the validity of the low&#8208;volatility fused&#8208;ring VSA strategy for boosting OSC performances.

A star&#8208;shaped cross&#8208;linked polyglutamate (StCl) nanocarrier delivers melanoma&#8208;associated peptide antigens via redox&#8208;responsive linkers, inducing lymph node&#8208;targeted antigen presentation. The nanoconjugate activates dendritic cells, promotes effector T&#8208;cell responses, and enables tumor regression even in humanized patient&#8208;derived preclinical models. This scalable platform offers a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy and synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated antigen&#8208;based cancer vaccines suffer from limited clinical success compared to alternative immunotherapies in melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The anti&#8208;tumor potential of a multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccine platform &#8211; a cross&#8208;linked star&#8208;shaped polyglutamate carrier (StCl) with marked lymphotropic character conjugated with melanoma&#8208;associated peptide antigens is evaluated through redox&#8208;responsive linkers. The co&#8208;delivery of melanoma&#8208;associated peptide antigens by the nanoconjugate platform induced significant effector immune responses in a mouse melanoma model. The nanoconjugate platform synergized with a PD&#8208;1 inhibitor to revert the immunosuppressive melanoma tumor microenvironment by improving cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration, which prompted a superior anti&#8208;tumor effect with prolonged overall survival without acute organ toxicity. The antigen&#8208;specific anti&#8208;tumor immune response induced by the nanoconjugate platform is also validated in a melanoma patient&#8208;derived xenograft mouse model. A promising, versatile StCl&#8208;based platform is reported for generating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccines for the safe and efficient immunotherapeutic treatment of melanoma.

The anti-tumor potential of a multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccine platform &#8211; a cross-linked star-shaped polyglutamate carrier (StCl) with marked lymphotropic character conjugated with melanoma-associated peptide antigens is evaluated through redox-responsive linkers. The co-delivery of melanoma-associated peptide antigens by the nanoconjugate platform induced significant effector immune responses in a mouse melanoma model. The nanoconjugate platform synergized with a PD-1 inhibitor to revert the immunosuppressive melanoma tumor microenvironment by improving cytotoxic T-cell infiltration, which prompted a superior anti-tumor effect with prolonged overall survival without acute organ toxicity. The antigen-specific anti-tumor immune response induced by the nanoconjugate platform is also validated in a melanoma patient-derived xenograft mouse model. A promising, versatile StCl-based platform is reported for generating off-the-shelf multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccines for the safe and efficient immunotherapeutic treatment of melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>4.2 V O3&#8208;Layered Cathodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells Enabled by an Intermolecular&#8208;Reinforced Ether Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, an intermolecular&#8208;reinforced ether&#8208;based electrolyte is presented to well stabilize the aggressive NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 cathode at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.2 VNa. With this electrolyte, a high&#8208;voltage aAhmpere&#8208;hour&#8208;level pouch cell based on the cathode and hard carbon anode shows excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles.








Abstract
To fulfill the requirements for practical applications, it is urgent to boost the gravimetric energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. An effective way is to increase the charging voltage of O3&#8208;type layered cathodes preferably to 4.2 V versus Na/Na+ (VNa). Nevertheless, it is extremely challenging to achieve stable cycling of the cathodes at such a high cut&#8208;off voltage. Here a novel electrolyte strategy to design an intermolecular&#8208;reinforced electrolyte (IRE) is presented, utilizing meticulously protected ether molecules, which facilitates stable high&#8208;voltage cycling of the commercially viable NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM). While the NFM with the IRE exhibits a high specific capacity of &#8776;158 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.2 VNa (130 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4.0 VNa), the aggressive cathode surface can still be effectively stabilized by the formation of favorable thin and inorganic&#8208;rich cathode&#8722;electrolyte interfaces. Remarkably, under a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.2 VNa, an industrial ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level NFM||hard carbon pouch cell with the IRE electrolyte shows an excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability with 82.8% capacity retention after 800 cycles, largely outperforming the localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (82.9% after 200 cycles).

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article presents a non&#8208;destructive molecular encoding approach using hierarchical array of functionalized graphene&#8208;based sensors for spatiotemporal analysis of volatile signaling molecules. Combined with deep learning, this method enables real&#8208;time imaging and genetic profiling of organoids, deciphering molecular production pathways through specific enzymes and metabolic routes and advancing precision diagnostics and personalized medicine without harmful staining or sample destruction.








Abstract
Organoids mimic human organ function, offering insights into development and disease. However, non&#8208;destructive, real&#8208;time monitoring is lacking, as traditional methods are often costly, destructive, and low&#8208;throughput. In this article, a non&#8208;destructive chemical tomographic strategy is presented for decoding cyto&#8208;proteo&#8208;genomics of organoid using volatile signaling molecules, hereby, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), to indicate metabolic activity and development of organoids. Combining a hierarchical design of graphene&#8208;based sensor arrays with AI&#8208;driven analysis, this method maps VOC spatiotemporal distribution and generate detailed digital profiles of organoid morphology and proteo&#8208;genomic features. Lens&#8208; and label&#8208;free, it avoids phototoxicity, distortion, and environmental disruption. Results from testing organoids with the reported chemical tomography approach demonstrate effective differentiation between cyto&#8208;proteo&#8208;genomic profiles of normal and diseased states, particularly during dynamic transitions such as epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, the reported approach identifies key VOC&#8208;related biochemical pathways, metabolic markers, and pathways associated with cancerous transformations such as aromatic acid degradation and lipid metabolism. This real&#8208;time, non&#8208;destructive approach captures subtle genetic and structural variations with high sensitivity and specificity, providing a robust platform for multi&#8208;omics integration and advancing cancer biomarker discovery.

         <title>Integrating PtCo Intermetallic with Highly Graphitized Carbon Toward Durable Oxygen Electroreduction in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By virtue of the tailor&#8208;made Pt electronic configuration and excellently corrosion&#8208;resistant carbon support, the O&#8208;PtCo@GCoNC integrating PtCo intermetallic with a Pt&#8208;rich shell and highly graphitized carbon exhibits significantly enhanced ORR activity and stability, attaining outstanding performance in H2/air PEMFC, outstripping the United States Department of Energy 2025 target.








Abstract
Exploiting robust and high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) toward long&#8208;term operation for practical applications, yet remains challenging. Herein, the ordered PtCo intermetallic is reported with a Pt&#8208;rich shell loaded on a highly graphitized carbon carrier (O&#8208;PtCo@GCoNC) prepared by an impregnation annealing strategy. Systematic X&#8208;ray spectroscopic, operando electrochemical techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that thanks to the synergistic interaction of the core&#8211;shell PtCo intermetallic structure with a tailor&#8208;made Pt electronic configuration and highly graphitized carbon, O&#8208;PtCo@GCoNC exhibits significantly enhanced activity and stability toward ORR. Crucially, O&#8208;PtCo@GCoNC delivers a much&#8208;enhanced mass activity of 0.83 A mgPt&#8722;1 at 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1 m HClO4, which only drops by 26.5% after 70&#160;000 cycles (0.6&#8211;1.0 V vs RHE), and 10.8% after 10&#160;000 cycles (1.0&#8211;1.5 V vs RHE), apparently overmatching Pt/C (0.19 A mgPt&#8722;1, 73.7%, and 63.1%). Moreover, O&#8208;PtCo@GCoNC employed as the cathode catalyst in H2/air PEMFC achieves a superb peak power density (1.04 W cm&#8722;2 at 2.06 A cm&#8722;2), outperforming that of Pt/C (0.86 W cm&#8722;2 at 1.79 A cm&#8722;2). The cell voltage loss at 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is 28 mV after 30&#160;000 cycles, outstripping the United States Department of Energy&#160;2025 target.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs with BT. 2020 Blue Gamut, External Quantum Efficiency Approaching 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TADF sensitizers targeting deep&#8208;blue emitters are designed by combining the advantages of short&#8208;range and long&#8208;range charge&#8208;transfer excited states. The resulting sensitizers enable high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with BT. 2020 blue gamut together with external quantum efficiency approaching 40%.








Abstract
The hyperfluorescence (HF) technology holds great promise for the development of high&#8208;quality organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) for their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off. Sensitizer plays a crucial role in the performance of HF devices. However, designing sensitizers with simultaneous high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), rapid radiative decay (kr), and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (kRISC) poses a great challenge, particularly for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers targeting deep&#8208;blue HF device. Herein, by introducing a boron&#8208;containing multi&#8208;resonance&#8208;type acceptor into the multi&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;carbazole encapsulated benzene molecular skeleton, two TADF emitters featuring hybridized multi&#8208;channel charge&#8208;transfer pathways, including short&#8208;range multi&#8208;resonance, weakened through&#8208;bond, and compact face&#8208;to&#8208;face through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer. Benefiting from the rational molecular design, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sensitizers exhibit simultaneous rapid kr of 5.3 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, fast kRISC up to 5.9 &#215; 105 s&#8722;1, a PQLY of near&#8208;unity, as well as ideal deep&#8208;blue emission in both solution and film. Consequently, the corresponding deep&#8208;blue HF devices not only achieve chromaticity coordinates that fully comply with the latest BT. 2020 standards, but also showcase record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies nearing 40%, along with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off.

&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), and fast reverse intersystem crossing rate (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt;) poses a great challenge, particularly for the thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) sensitizers targeting deep-blue HF device. Herein, by introducing a boron-containing multi-resonance-type acceptor into the multi-&lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl-carbazole encapsulated benzene molecular skeleton, two TADF emitters featuring hybridized multi-channel charge-transfer pathways, including short-range multi-resonance, weakened through-bond, and compact face-to-face through-space charge-transfer. Benefiting from the rational molecular design, the proof-of-concept sensitizers exhibit simultaneous rapid &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of 5.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, fast &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RISC&lt;/sub&gt; up to 5.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, a PQLY of near-unity, as well as ideal deep-blue emission in both solution and film. Consequently, the corresponding deep-blue HF devices not only achieve chromaticity coordinates that fully comply with the latest BT. 2020 standards, but also showcase record-high maximum external quantum efficiencies nearing 40%, along with suppressed efficiency roll-off.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Vacancy Confinement in Anatase TiO2 for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to spatially confine oxygen vacancy (VO) is demonstrated in the homo&#8208;interface of anatase TiO2. The confined VO in anatase TiO2 not only exhibits metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility, but also promotes photocarrier lifetime. This synthetic strategy emphasizes how sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels in confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light&#8208;driven catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven energy conversion devices call for the atomic&#8208;level manipulation of defects associated with electronic states in solids. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancy (VO) as a source of sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels have hampered the precise control of the distribution and concentration of VO. Here, a new strategy to spatially confine VO at the homo&#8208;interfaces is demonstrated by exploiting the sequential growth of anatase TiO2 under dissimilar thermodynamic conditions. Remarkably, metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility is observed after sequential growth of the TiO2 films under low pressure and temperature (L&#8208;TiO2) on top of high&#8208;quality anatase TiO2 epitaxial films (H&#8208;TiO2), despite the insulating properties of L&#8208;TiO2 and H&#8208;TiO2 single layers. Multiple characterizations elucidate that the VO layer is geometrically confined within 4 unit cells at the interface, along with low&#8208;temperature crystallization of upper L&#8208;TiO2 films; this 2D VO layer is responsible for the formation of in&#8208;gap states, promoting photocarrier lifetime (&#8776;300%) and light absorption. These results suggest a synthetic strategy to locally confine functional defects and emphasize how sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels in the confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light&#8208;driven catalytic reactions.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering of Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots In Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a photochemical synthetic route for bandgap engineering of metal halide perovskite quantum dots. Utilizing a material&#8208;efficient microfluidic platform, the underlying mechanism of the photo&#8208;induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER)&#160;of metal halide perovskite quantum dots is unveiled and first instance of the PIAER&#8208;enabled synthesis of high&#8208;performing CsPbI3 NCs is reported.








Abstract
Over the past decade, lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted significant attention due to their tunable optoelectronic properties for next&#8208;generation printed photonic and electronic devices. High&#8208;energy photons in the presence of haloalkanes provide a scalable and sustainable pathway for precise bandgap engineering of LHP NCs via photo&#8208;induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) facilitated by in situ generated halide anions. However, the mechanisms driving photo&#8208;induced bandgap engineering in LHP NCs remain not fully understood. This study elucidates the underlying PIAER mechanisms of LHP NCs through an advanced microfluidic platform. Additionally, the first instance of a PIAER, transforming CsPbBr3 NCs into high&#8208;performing CsPbI3 NCs, with the assistance of a thiol&#8208;based additive is reported. Utilizing an intensified photo&#8208;flow microreactor accelerates the anion exchange rate 3.5&#8208;fold, reducing material consumption 100&#8208;fold compared to conventional batch processes. It is demonstrated that CsPbBr3 NCs act as photocatalysts, driving oxidative bond cleavage in dichloromethane and promoting the photodissociation of 1&#8208;iodopropane using high&#8208;energy photons. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a thiol&#8208;based additive plays a dual role: surface passivation, which enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield, and facilitates the PIAER. These findings pave the way for the tailored design of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Control Over Metal&#8208;Halide Reactivity Enables Uniform Growth of InSb Colloidal Quantum Dots for Enhanced SWIR Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, it is demonstrated that controlling metal halide precursors' reactivity with organic additives during nucleation and growth enables the synthesis of InSb CQDs with narrow size distributions. Alkanethiol resurfacing facilitates efficient ligand exchange and integration into n&#8208;i&#8208;p photodiodes, exhibiting 10&#185;2 Jones detectivity, 33% EQE at 1380 nm, and &gt;19 h of operational stability.








Abstract
InSb&#160;colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) hold promise in short&#8208;wave infrared&#160;sensing; however, their synthesis presents ongoing challenges, particularly in achieving precise size control &#8211; this is the result of poorly controlled reactivity among the precursors. Herein, the use of alkyl&#8208;phosphine and amine&#8208;based organic additives to control the reactivity of In and Sb precursors during the nucleation and growth of CQDs is developed. This interplay between organic additive and precursors enables the synthesis of InSb CQDs having narrowed size distributions; and bandgaps tunable across the 1.2&#8211;1.5&#160;&#181;m spectral range; all this leading to peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley ratios &gt;1.4 in absorption spectra. The CQDs are surface&#8208;terminated with a mixture of oleylamine, halides, and oxide&#8208;like species, and this hinders ligand exchange reactions and subsequent integration into photodiodes. We therefore resurface the CQDs with alkanethiols, displacing the native ligands via an acid&#8208;base mechanism, an approach that removes oxide species. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication process, the ligands of the resurfaced InSb CQDs are exchanged with short organic and halide ligands and incorporated films into n&#8208;i&#8208;p photodiode structures. The resultant devices exhibit a detectivity of 10&#185;2 Jones, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 33% at 1380&#160;nm, and T90 operating stability of &gt;19 h under continuous illuminated operation.

         <title>Dynamic&#160;and Reversible&#160;Tuning&#160;of Hydrogel Viscoelasticity&#160;by Transient Polymer Interactions for&#160;Controlling Cell Adhesion</title>

         <dc:description>
Biological systems are very responsive to changes in stiffness, influencing important processes, and diseases in humans. Here, a novel method to dynamically and reversibly control hydrogel stiffness through interactions with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) is presented. By exposing hydrogels to PEG solutions at different concentrations and sizes, hydrogel stiffness can be tuned, in turn affecting cell properties.








Abstract
Cells are highly responsive to changes in their mechanical environment, influencing processes such as stem cell differentiation and tumor progression. To meet the growing demand for materials used for high throughput mechanotransduction studies, simple means of dynamically adjusting the environmental viscoelasticity of cell cultures are needed. Here, a novel method is presented to dynamically and reversibly control the viscoelasticity of naturally derived polymer hydrogels through interactions with poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG). Interactions between PEG and hydrogel polymers, possibly involving hydrogen bonding, stiffen the hydrogel matrices. By dynamically changing the PEG concentration of the solution in which polymer hydrogels are incubated, their viscoelastic properties are adjusted, which in turn affects cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization. Importantly, this effects is reversible, providing a cost&#8208;effective and simple strategy for dynamically adjusting the viscoelasticity of polymer hydrogels. This method holds promise for applications in mechanobiology, biomedicine, and the life sciences.

         <title>Alkaline Adjuvant Regulates Proteolytic Activity of Macrophages for Antigen Cross&#8208;Presentation and Potentiates Radioimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue&#8208;repairing macrophages compromise radiotherapy&#8208;induced antitumor immunity. An alkaline adjuvant (MgAl&#8208;based hydrotalcite, bLDH) reverses the situation. After engendering macrophages to phagocytose irradiated cancer cells, bLDH is administrated and improves the cross&#8208;presentation of engulfed tumor antigens over tenfold. bLDH limits the activity of phagolysosomal proteases and enables direct major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation in phagosome to improve precision radioimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Failures of radiotherapy (RT) in adaptive antitumor immunomodulation often associate with recruited tissue&#8208;repairing macrophages. Although training these macrophages to phagocytose post&#8208;RT cancer cells reverses their protumoral performance, engulfed tumor antigens are severely underrated. In fact, regulating the processing and presentation of tumor antigens, a key determinant of tumor immunogenicity, can fundamentally affect adaptive immune responses. Here it is reported that a simple Alum&#8208;like adjuvant (MgAl&#8208;based hydrotalcite, bLDH) improves radioimmunotherapy via inducing antigen cross&#8208;presentation by macrophages, independent of phenotypes. It is identified that cytidine monophosphate guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide engenders macrophages to phagocytose irradiated cancer cells. However, as semiprofessional antigen&#8208;presenting cells, macrophages possess powerful proteolytic function that is detrimental to antigen presentation. The administration of alkaline bLDH intriguingly relieves the activity of phagolysosomal proteases with acidic pH optima by preventing phagosomal acidification resulting from the vacuolar&#8208;type ATPase proton pump. The adjuvant&#8208;modulated phagolysosomes thus limit antigen degradation and enhance tumor antigen cross&#8208;presentation over tenfold. To examine from an in vivo breast tumor model, trained macrophages successfully cross&#8208;prime antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and curb RT&#8208;associated metastasis. The findings propose to pay close attention to the effect of adjuvants on precision immunotherapy and highlight the positive contribution of cross&#8208;presenting macrophages in radioimmunotherapy.

         <title>Robust Nanoscale Anode Protective Layers toward Fast&#8208;Charge High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin (&#8776;84&#160;nm) and robust protective layer is constructed by reactive molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSAg). Benefiting from the in situ reaction between PSSAg side&#8208;chains and Li metal, the modified Li anode integrates abundant Li&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi chains, robust GO backbones, and Li&#8211;Ag solid solution, thereby enabling molecular&#8208;level homogeneous and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion, remarkable mechanical strength and homogeneous Li deposition.








Abstract
Mechanically stable and structurally homogeneous lithium&#8211;electrolyte interfacial layers are crucial in stabilizing lithium (Li) anodes for practical Li metal batteries. Herein, an ultrathin (&#8776;84&#160;nm) and robust artificial protective layer is constructed with reactive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) molecular brushes as building blocks. The artificial protective layer can in situ react with underlying Li metal to produce a nanoscale poly(lithium styrenesulfonate)&#8208;grafted graphene oxide (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) layer on the outermost surface and an infinite Li&#8211;Ag solid solution in the anode. The nanoscale GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi layer well integrates a large number of single Li&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi chains and 2D robust GO backbones, thereby enabling molecular&#8208;level homogeneous and fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion as well as remarkable mechanical strength. Meanwhile, the simultaneously formed Li&#8211;Ag solid solution is beneficial for rapid Li transport in the anode to reduce the Li nucleation barrier and facilitate homogeneous deposition of Li. With such artificial protective layers, a prototype pouch cell with a thin Li metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and a high&#8208;loading cathode (21.6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive cycle life of over 350 cycles with 69% capacity retention under harsh conditions. Remarkably, ultrahigh charging power density of 456&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy density of 325&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 can be simultaneously achieved in an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Ultralong Room Temperature Phosphorescence Based on Biomass Macrocycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance ultralong biomass room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) doped systems with phosphorescence quantum up to 32.8%, lifetime up to 4.65 s, and multi&#8208;stimulus response through multiple interactions between host biomass macrocycle and guest is reported. The RTP performance of biomass macrocycle doped systems far exceeds biomass systems ever reported and compares favorably with highly effective polymer systems.








Abstract
The pursuit of sustainable, high&#8208;performance organic ultralong room temperature phosphorescence (OURTP) materials with stimulus&#8208;responsive properties presents a significant and enticing yet formidable challenge. Herein, an efficient strategy to confining boric acid&#8208;based compounds into biomass macrocycle &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin through multiple interactions is developed, enabling the construction of high&#8208;performance and multicolor OURTP doped systems. The synergistic effects of strong hydrogen bonding, C&#9472;O&#9472;B covalent cross&#8208;linking, and host&#8211;guest encapsulation significantly suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, culminating in an extraordinary lifetime and excellent phosphorescence quantum yield of 4.65 s and 32.8%, respectively, which are far superior to reported biomass RTP materials. Additionally, merging biomass macrocycle with phosphors contributes to multiple stimulus responses, overcoming the inherent limitations of degradation and recycling of organic RTP compounds, and dynamically modulating RTP signals through multiple&#8208;stimulus responses, achieving the integration of multifunctional dynamic data processing techniques. This work will provide a direction for new environmentally friendly and potentially commercially available stimulus&#8208;responsive OURTP materials.

         <title>Reactive Plasma Deposition of ITO as an Efficient Buffer Layer for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the use of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) to fabricate indium tin oxide (ITO) buffer layers for wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells. The RPD&#8208;ITO devices exhibit enhanced thermal stability, reduced recombination losses, and improved efficiency. A four&#8208;terminal tandem cell achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 29.03%, showcasing the potential of RPD for advanced photovoltaics.








Abstract
In this study, the potential of reactive plasma deposition (RPD) is demonstrated for fabricating indium tin oxide (ITO) as an efficient buffer layer in inverted wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This method results in a certified efficiency of 21.33% for wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, demonstrating superior thermal stability and operational stability. The optimized devices achieve an impressive open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.252&#160;V with a bandgap of 1.67&#160;eV, resulting in a remarkably low voltage deficit of 0.418&#160;V, attributed to improved electron extraction, reduced interface defects, and suppressed surface recombination. The cells maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1023&#160;h of thermal aging at 88&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, by integrating a highly efficient semi&#8208;transparent PSC with a CIGS bottom cell, a four&#8208;terminal tandem configuration is achieved with a total efficiency of 29.03%, representing one of the most efficient perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells reported to date. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of RPD for improving the performance and scalability of inverted wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs.

&lt;/i&gt;) of 1.252&#160;V with a bandgap of 1.67&#160;eV, resulting in a remarkably low voltage deficit of 0.418&#160;V, attributed to improved electron extraction, reduced interface defects, and suppressed surface recombination. The cells maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after 1023&#160;h of thermal aging at 88&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, by integrating a highly efficient semi-transparent PSC with a CIGS bottom cell, a four-terminal tandem configuration is achieved with a total efficiency of 29.03%, representing one of the most efficient perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells reported to date. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of RPD for improving the performance and scalability of inverted wide-bandgap PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Current&#8208;Driven Magnetization Switching for Superconducting Diode Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting magnetization diode effect in stacking superconductors with ferromagnetic materials heterostructures, enabling robust magnetization readout through superconductivity with an ideally infinite on/off ratio, is demonstrated. Combining spin&#8211;orbit torque for current&#8208;driven magnetization switching, this work bridges superconductivity and spintronics, offering scalable, energy&#8208;efficient memory solutions with simplified design and improved performance.









Abstract
Stacking superconductors (SC) with ferromagnetic materials (FM) significantly impact superconductivity, enabling the emergence of spin&#8208;triplet states and topological superconductivity. The tuning of superconductivity in SC&#8208;FM heterostructure is also reflected in the recently discovered superconducting diode effect, characterized by nonreciprocal electric transport when time and inversion symmetries are broken. Notably, in SC&#8208;FM systems, a time reversal operation reverses both current and magnetization, leading to the conceptualization of superconducting magnetization diode effect (SMDE). In this variant, while the current direction remains fixed, the critical currents shall be different when reversing the magnetization. Here, the existence of SMDE in SC&#8208;FM heterostructures is demonstrated. SMDE uniquely maps magnetization states onto superconductivity by setting the read current between two critical currents for the positive and negative magnetization directions, respectively. Thus, the magnetization states can be read by measuring the superconductivity, while the writing process is accomplished by manipulating magnetization states through current&#8208;driven spin&#8211;orbit torque to switch the superconductivity. The proposed superconducting diode magnetoresistance in SC&#8208;FM heterostructures with an ideally infinite on/off ratio resolves the limitations of tunneling magnetoresistance in the magnetic tunneling junctions, thereby contributing to the advancement of superconducting spintronics.

         <title>Rapid Drying Principle for High&#8208;speed, Pinhole&#8208;Less, Uniform Wet Deposition Protocols of Water&#8208;Dispersed 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed and inexpensive deposition techniques are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. Rapid drying principle deriving hot dipping and air knife sweeping deposition protocols achieves film uniformity, scalability, and tunable thickness simultaneously by suppressing time for secondary flows. The large&#8208;area extendibility, pinhole&#8208;less feature, and m2&#160;min&#8722;1&#8208;level deposition speed offer unprecedented processes for 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices more cheaply.








Abstract
Inexpensive, high&#8208;speed deposition techniques that ensure uniformity, scalability, wide applicability, and tunable thickness are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. In this work, rapid drying is identified as a key mechanism for pioneering two high&#8208;speed wet deposition methods: hot dipping and air knife sweeping (AKS). Both techniques allow thickness control proportional to flake concentration, achieving tiled monolayers and pinhole&#8208;free coverage across the entire substrate, as long as evaporation outpaces flake diffusion. AKS prevents non&#8208;uniformity along substrate edges by eliminating contact line pinning. The achieved deposition speed of 0.21 m2&#160;min&#8722;1 with AKS significantly surpasses traditional methods, enabling the equipment for large substrates &gt;&#160;1 m2. Combined with the ultralow debonding force for mechanically susceptible flexible display production and short&#8208;circuit&#8208;proof nanometer&#8208;thin capacitors with capacitance comparable to commercial multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), these new protocols showcase simple and swift solutions for manufacturing 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices.

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Structured Antiferroelectric Composite Ceramics for Energy Storage Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase&#8208;filed simulations, a strategy of controlling the morphology and ordering of Al2O3 fillers in Pb&#8208;based AFE composite ceramics is proposed, aiming to improve its breakdown strength. Significantly improved Eb of 570&#160;kV cm&#8722;1 and ultrahigh Wrec of 13.2 J cm&#8722;3 are achieved in composite ceramics with parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors possessing high power density and ultrashort discharge time are valuable for high&#8208;power energy storage applications. However, achieving high energy storage density remains challenging due to the limited breakdown strength of dielectric ceramics. In this study, inspired by the layered architecture of natural nacre and with the guidance of phase&#8208;field simulations, a strategy of constructing a nacre&#8208;like layered structure is proposed to improve the breakdown strength and energy storage density of the ceramics. This unique structure is formed by controlling the morphology and ordering of high&#8208;voltage&#8208;resistant fillers in a ceramic matrix. The (Pb0.98La0.02)(Zr0.7Sn0.3)0.995O3&#8208;Al2O3 antiferroelectric composite ceramics, containing 5vol% parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates, demonstrate a remarkable enhancement in breakdown strength from 390 to 570&#160;kV cm&#8722;1. Of particular importance is that an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density of up to 13.2 J cm&#8722;3 is achieved, representing a 50% enhancement compared to the pure ceramic (8.7 J cm&#8722;3). The parallel&#8208;aligned Al2O3 plates are strongly bound together with the ceramic matrix, effectively blocking charge migration and controlling the breakdown path, thus greatly enhancing the voltage endurance of the composite ceramics. This work provides an innovative approach to designing high&#8208;performance composite ceramics for next&#8208;generation energy storage applications.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Composite Membranes for Nanofluidic Ionic Photoelectric Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully conjugated 2D hexaimino&#8208;substituted triphenylene&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF) based composite membrane is reported for nanofluidic photoelectric conversion. Owing to the intrinsic advantage of multiple charge transport pathways, and open framework with nano&#8208;spaced, high&#8208;density pores, the 2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF&#8208;based composite membrane possesses fast photoelectric response, successful ion pump phenomenon, and efficient photoelectric energy conversion.








Abstract
Nanofluidic photoelectric conversion system based on photo&#8208;excitable 2D materials can directly transduce light stimuli into an ion&#8208;transport&#8208;mediated electric signal, showing potential for mimicking the retina's function with a more favorable human&#8211;robot interactions. However, the current membranes suffer from low generation efficiency of charge carriers due to the mixed microstructure and limited charge transport ability caused by the large interlayer spacing and monotonous pathway. Here, a fully conjugated 2D hexaimino&#8208;substituted triphenylene&#8208;based&#160;metal&#8211;organic framework (2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF) based composite membrane with high conductivity for photoelectric conversion is presented. The extended &#960;&#8208;d conjugation within the ab plane and the favorable transport pathway through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of the c&#8208;MOF maximize the generation and transfer of charge carrier and greatly accelerate the ion transport. As a result, the 2D&#8208;HATP&#8208;cMOF&#8208;based composite membrane possesses ultrafast photoelectric response, superior to other reported 2D systems like graphene oxide (GO), transition metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides (MXene), and MoS2, which require at least 10 s. A successful ion pump phenomenon, that is active transport from low concentration to high concentration as an important way of information transmission in organisms, is realized based on the efficient photoelectric conversion capability. This work demonstrates the great promise of 2D c&#8208;MOF in ionic photoelectric conversion.

         <title>2D AgTiPS6: a Cross&#8208;Stacked In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Semiconductor for Broadband and Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in&#8208;plane anisotropic material with cross&#8208;stacked motifs, are discovered and added to the 2D material family. They feature a thick monolayer, strong stability, and inherent anisotropy. As an in&#8208;plane anisotropic 2D semiconductor, AgTiPS6&#8208;based photodetectors demonstrate excellent photoresponse across a broad range from visible to mid&#8208;infrared, as well as high in&#8208;plane electrical (&#8776;5.44) and optoelectrical (&#8776;2.44) anisotropies. 








Abstract
2D anisotropic materials, typically consisting of 1D distorted chains arranged in parallel or anti&#8208;parallel patterns, are gaining attention for their potential in anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices. 2D anisotropic materials with cross&#8208;stacked interconnected 1D chains will show improved anisotropy and stability. Nonetheless, to date, no 2D anisotropic materials featuring cross&#8208;stacked motifs have been experimentally realized. This work identifies AgTiPS6 atomic layers, the 2D in&#8208;plane anisotropic material with cross&#8208;stacked structural motifs, as an n&#8208;type semiconductor with a 1.0&#160;eV band gap. Significantly, the unique cross&#8208;stacked configuration of 2D AgTiPS6 results in a significant in&#8208;plane anisotropy, with electrical and optoelectrical anisotropies measuring 5.44 and 2.44, respectively, as well as an axially orientation selectivity. Meanwhile, a broadband response from visible (Vis, 405&#160;nm) to middle infrared (MIR, 10.6&#160;&#181;m) is achieved in the AgTiPS6&#8208;based photodetector, with the photoresponse above the bandgap attributed to photothermoelectric effect. Furthermore, 2D AgTiPS6 has demonstrated environmental stability exceeding 12 months and a laser damage threshold exceeding 10&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to its extra&#8208;thick monolayer (1.32&#160;nm). This work introduces a novel in&#8208;plane anisotropic material, expanding the repertoire of 2D anisotropic materials and offering potential for the development of anisotropic electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the development trend, solvation structures, interfacial chemistry, and latest progress of lithium salts are discussed from the perspectives of coordination chemistry and structural design, hoping to provide inspiration for the on&#8208;demand design/customization of lithium salts, thereby promoting the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.








Abstract
Lithium batteries, favored for their high energy density and long lifespan, are staples in electric vehicles, portable electronics, and aerospace. A key component, Li salts, aids lithium ion migration and electrode protection, significantly impacting battery performance. Developing an ideal Li salt, balancing stability, solubility, dissociation, solvation, and eco&#8208;friendliness, remains challenging. Given the scarcity of relevant reviews, it is endeavored here to present a novel perspective on Li salt chemistry, offering a concise roadmap for future designs and innovations. It is delved into the trends, opportunities, design principles, and evaluation methodologies related to Li salt chemistry, with a particular emphasis on organic anionic compositions. Furthermore, the latest and most representative organic Li salts from their intrinsic structure and coordination chemistry, highlighting their unique features and contributions are organized and presented. Finally, a visionary outlook is articulated for this field, exploring avenues, such as customizing Li salts for specific applications, synthesizing Li salts on demand, and discussing the potential of F&#8208;free Li salts alongside with their electrochemical window challenges. Here it is served as a strategic compass, addressing the shortcomings of existing reviews and guiding the design of functionalized Li salts.

         <title>A Printed Microscopic Universal Gradient Interface for Super Stretchable Strain&#8208;Insensitive Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable bioelectronics conforming to dynamic body surfaces enable high&#8208;fidelity physiological monitoring but often suffer from motion artifacts. All&#8208;printed strain&#8208;insensitive bioelectronics are presented using a universal gradient interface (UGI) created via aerosol&#8208;based multi&#8208;materials printing (AMMP). The UGI minimizes local strain changes under 180% stretch, supporting artifact&#8208;free sensors for health monitoring and advancing wearable and implantable bioelectronics for personalized healthcare.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics capable of conforming to nonplanar and dynamic human body surfaces are central for creating implantable and on&#8208;skin devices for high&#8208;fidelity monitoring of diverse physiological signals. While various strategies have been developed to produce stretchable devices, the signals collected from such devices are often highly sensitive to local strain, resulting in inevitable convolution with surface strain&#8208;induced motion artifacts that are difficult to distinguish from intrinsic physiological signals. Here all&#8208;printed super stretchable strain&#8208;insensitive bioelectronics using a unique universal gradient interface (UGI) are reported to bridge the gap between soft biomaterials and stiff electronic materials. Leveraging a versatile aerosol&#8208;based multi&#8208;materials printing&#160;technique that allows precise spatial control over the local stiffnesses with submicron resolution, the UGI enables strain&#8208;insensitive electronic devices with negligible resistivity changes under a 180% uniaxial stretch ratio. Various stretchable devices are directly printed on the UGI for on&#8208;skin health monitoring with high signal quality and near&#8208;perfect immunity to motion artifacts, including semiconductor&#8208;based photodetectors for sensing blood oxygen saturation levels and metal&#8208;based temperature sensors. The concept in this work will significantly simplify the fabrication and accelerate the development of a broad range of wearable and implantable bioelectronics for real&#8208;time health monitoring and personalized therapeutics.

         <title>A DNA Nanopatch&#8208;Bacteriophage System Targeting Streptococcus Gallolyticus for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment and Colorectal Cancer Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work constructs a novel DNA nanopatch (DNPs)&#8208;modified bacteriophages (P&#8208;Sg) therapeutic platform (DNPs@P) for precise, gut&#8208;targeted therapy that potently reduces inflammation and prevents the colonic inflammation&#8208;to&#8208;carcinoma transition. To protect DNPs@P from the harsh gastrointestinal environment, this work encapsulates them with an enteric polymer acrylic resin (L100&#8208;55) (DNPs@P&#8208;L). Upon oral administration, the L100&#8208;55, ensures their safe passage through the stomach and release in the intestine. Then P&#8208;Sg target and lyse pathogenic bacteria at inflammatory sites, delivering DNPs precisely to affected regions, which can scavenge ROS in the inflammatory site.








Abstract
Persistent inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) increases Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sg) colonization, increasing the risk of colorectal cancer progression via the Sg&#8208;activated cyclooxygenase&#8208;2 (COX&#8208;2) pathway and &#946;&#8208;catenin upregulation. This study presents Sg&#8208;specific bacteriophages modified with DNA nanopatches (DNPs@P) designed to treat IBD and prevent Sg&#8208;induced malignancy. The DNPs are composed of DNA origami nanosheets and phage capture strands. The DNPs scavenge reactive oxygen species, enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of the phages while targeting and lysing pathogenic bacteria. Coating with an enteric polymer, DNPs@P ensures effective delivery in the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate significant restoration of colonic length, reduced inflammation, and improved gut microbiota diversity compared with current clinical treatments. Additionally, DNPs@P effectively prevents colonic tumourigenesis in mouse models. This approach presents a promising strategy for treating gastrointestinal diseases by remodeling the gut microenvironment, addressing a critical gap in current therapies.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Descriptor Tailoring: Rational Solvent Molecule Tuning Enables High&#8208;Voltage Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;descriptor approach is developed to design high&#8208;voltage electrolytes, combining Mulliken charge and Laplacian bond order to identify ideal solvents. Acetonitrile (AN) stabilizes meta&#8208;stable transition metal atoms and mitigates lattice oxygen instability at the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface. This strategy enables precise control of interfacial stability, advancing high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries with a versatile and adaptive framework.








Abstract
Electrolyte engineering to enhance the cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface stability is widely recognized as a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are currently hindered by the meta&#8208;stable surface of lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides. Despite significant progress in electrolyte development, clear design guidelines for high&#8208;voltage electrolytes remain lacking, making solvent selection unpredictable. Here, a dual&#8208;descriptor tailoring concept based on Mulliken charge (adsorption) and Laplacian bond order (antioxidation) to identify ideal solvent molecules for high&#8208;voltage electrolytes is proposed. This concept stabilizes meta&#8208;stable transition metal atoms in surface tetrahedral interstices through interactions between bottom solvent molecules and cathode dangling bonds. Acetonitrile (AN) is eventually selected as a promising bottom solvent that interacts strongly with unstable surface bonds, improving interfacial stability. Consequently, the prepared 0.6 Ah graphite||LCO pouch cell using AN&#8208;based electrolyte maintained a remarkable 80% capacity retention after 900 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at high cut&#8208;off voltage. This work revisits the interfacial stability mechanism across different electrolyte classes, where strong solvent adsorption mitigates the instability of the meta&#8208;stable Co spin state, reduces surface band overlap, and alleviates the instability of lattice oxygen at the interface. This dual&#8208;descriptor&#8208;guided design opens a new avenue for high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries is believed.

     alt="Dual-Descriptor Tailoring: Rational Solvent Molecule Tuning Enables High-Voltage Li-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dual-descriptor approach is developed to design high-voltage electrolytes, combining Mulliken charge and Laplacian bond order to identify ideal solvents. Acetonitrile (AN) stabilizes meta-stable transition metal atoms and mitigates lattice oxygen instability at the cathode-electrolyte interface. This strategy enables precise control of interfacial stability, advancing high-voltage lithium-ion batteries with a versatile and adaptive framework.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrolyte engineering to enhance the cathode-electrolyte interface stability is widely recognized as a promising strategy for achieving high-voltage lithium-ion batteries, which are currently hindered by the meta-stable surface of lithium-rich layered oxides. Despite significant progress in electrolyte development, clear design guidelines for high-voltage electrolytes remain lacking, making solvent selection unpredictable. Here, a dual-descriptor tailoring concept based on Mulliken charge (adsorption) and Laplacian bond order (antioxidation) to identify ideal solvent molecules for high-voltage electrolytes is proposed. This concept stabilizes meta-stable transition metal atoms in surface tetrahedral interstices through interactions between bottom solvent molecules and cathode dangling bonds. Acetonitrile (AN) is eventually selected as a promising bottom solvent that interacts strongly with unstable surface bonds, improving interfacial stability. Consequently, the prepared 0.6 Ah graphite||LCO pouch cell using AN-based electrolyte maintained a remarkable 80% capacity retention after 900 cycles with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.92% at high cut-off voltage. This work revisits the interfacial stability mechanism across different electrolyte classes, where strong solvent adsorption mitigates the instability of the meta-stable Co spin state, reduces surface band overlap, and alleviates the instability of lattice oxygen at the interface. This dual-descriptor-guided design opens a new avenue for high-voltage Li-ion batteries is believed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Machine Learning in Polymer Research</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated every aspect of science, including polymer research. Researchers from both fields need to collaborate to understand the challenges and opportunities of each domain. This review is therefore written by mathematicians and polymer chemists to highlight the key research questions polymer chemists aim to address and how machine learning can assist in answering them.








Abstract
Machine learning is increasingly being applied in polymer chemistry to link chemical structures to macroscopic properties of polymers and to identify chemical patterns in the polymer structures that help improve specific properties. To facilitate this, a chemical dataset needs to be translated into machine readable descriptors. However, limited and inadequately curated datasets, broad molecular weight distributions, and irregular polymer configurations pose significant challenges. Most off the shelf mathematical models often need refinement for specific applications. Addressing these challenges demand a close collaboration between chemists and mathematicians as chemists must formulate research questions in mathematical terms while mathematicians are required to refine models for specific applications. This review unites both disciplines to address dataset curation hurdles and highlight advances in polymer synthesis and modeling that enhance data availability. It then surveys ML approaches used to predict solid&#8208;state properties, solution behavior, composite performance, and emerging applications such as drug delivery and the polymer&#8211;biology interface. A perspective of the field is concluded and the importance of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data and the integration of polymer theory and data are discussed, and the thoughts on the machine&#8211;human interface are shared.

         <title>Harnessing Amino Acid Modularity for Programmable Function in Covalent Peptide Assemblies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent peptide assembly integrates the robustness of covalent bonds with the adaptability of dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions. Systematic amino acid substitution screening yields programmable peptide frameworks, facilitating the advanced engineering of features such as frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architectures, affinity enrichment, stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and signal amplification. This approach revolutionizes multicomponent peptide assembly, offering enhanced complexity, versatility, and multifunctional potential.








Abstract
Covalent peptide assembly leverages robust covalent bonds and dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions to provide enhanced stability and introduce diverse functionalities. Nevertheless, it remains significantly challenging to achieve modular control over the structural diversity and functional complexity while elucidating how specific amino acid sequences contribute to these processes. Here, the systematic encoding of peptide derivative characteristics is demonstrated through amino acid modularity to enable precise control over both the structural diversity and functional complexity in covalent peptide assemblies. By systematically screening single amino acid substitutions in pentapeptides using tyrosine crosslinking, a diverse library of peptide constructs is developed. Each construct is tailored to exhibit distinct properties, including charge repulsion, aggregation&#8208;induced quenching, disassembly behavior, and redox responsiveness. The strategic manipulation of sequence composition, both in individual assemblies and combinatorial systems, enables programmable control over the structural diversity and functional complexity. This approach yields various module&#8208;specific functions, including frustrated growth, hierarchical hollow architecture formation, affinity enrichment, stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior, and fluorescence signal amplification. This work establishes a framework for the design of modular peptide materials with programmable functionalities, advancing the development of next&#8208;generation multicomponent peptide assembly technologies characterized by unprecedented complexity and adaptability.

         <title>Local Chemical Enhancement and Gating of Organic Coordinated Ionic&#8208;Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction.








Abstract
Superior properties in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) over inorganic counterparts have inspired intense interest in biosensing, soft&#8208;robotics, neuromorphic computing, and smart medicine. However, slow ion transport relative to charge transport in these materials is a limiting factor. Here, it is demonstrated that hydrophilic molecules local to an interfacial OMIEC nanochannel can accelerate ion transport with ion mobilities surpassing electrophoretic transport by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, ion access to this interfacial channel can be gated through local surface energy. This mechanism is applied in a novel sensing device, which electronically detects and characterizes chemical reaction dynamics local to the buried channel. The ability to enhance ion transport at the nanoscale in OMIECs as well as govern ion transport through local chemical signaling enables new functionalities for printable, stretchable, and biocompatible mixed conduction devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Resistance Photoluminescence Carbonized Polymer Dots Through Equilibrium Bi&#8208;Confinement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, bi&#8208;confinement effects arising from a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and rigid Al&#8322;O&#8323; matrix are exploited to achieve ultra&#8208;stable carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The obtained CPDs@Al2O3 composite demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability in various solvents and high photoluminescence emission thermotolerance up to 500&#160;K for 150&#160;h, representing the best performance of carbon dots under harsh conditions reported to date.








Abstract
Carbon dots are emerging luminescent nanomaterials that have drawn considerable attention due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, and customizable optical properties. However, their susceptibility to temperature&#8208;induced vibrational exciton changes and the tendency to thermal quenching of emission have hindered their practical applications. Here, a method is reported for achieving high&#8208;temperature photoluminescence carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) through a bi&#8208;confinement approach that involves a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and a rigid Al2O3 matrix. As the temperature increased from 303 to 500&#160;K, the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission intensities of CPDs@Al2O3 remained virtually unchanged, with the emission duration exceeding 150&#160;h at 500&#160;K. Additionally, CPDs@Al2O3 composites with different degrees of carbonization exhibit dynamic excitation&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties, which can be patterned for multiple information encryption application. This work provides a concept for designing stable and luminous CPDs under harsh conditions, thus expanding their potential application range.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Actuated Cuff Electrodes with Minimal Contact for Bidirectional Peripheral Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) for bidirectional peripheral interfaces enable minimal and secure contact to the nerve through fluid injection&#8208;based soft actuation. A 3D bent structure can grasp and securely contact the nerves with only a little pressure (&lt;1.21 gram&#8208;force). The SACE can achieve negligible damage to the nerve during recording of sensory and motor feedback signals with superior SNR and neuromodulation for long&#8208;term studies.








Abstract
Neural interfaces with embedded electrical functions, such as cuff electrodes, are essential for monitoring and stimulating peripheral nerves. Still, several challenges remain with cuff electrodes because sutured devices can damage the nerve by high pressure and the secured contact of electrodes with the nerve is hard to accomplish, which however is essential in maintaining electrical performance. Here, a sutureless soft&#8208;actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) that can envelop the nerve conveniently by creating a bent shape controlled upon fluid injection, is introduced. Moreover, fluid injection protrudes part of the device where electrodes are formed, thereby achieving minimized, soft but secure contact between the electrodes and the nerve. In vivo results demonstrate the successful recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves over time up to 6 weeks. While securing contact with the nerve, the implanted electrodes can preserve the nerve intact with no reduction in blood flow, thereby indicating only minimal compressive force applied to the nerve.

     alt="Soft-Actuated Cuff Electrodes with Minimal Contact for Bidirectional Peripheral Interfaces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soft-actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) for bidirectional peripheral interfaces enable minimal and secure contact to the nerve through fluid injection-based soft actuation. A 3D bent structure can grasp and securely contact the nerves with only a little pressure (&amp;lt;1.21 gram-force). The SACE can achieve negligible damage to the nerve during recording of sensory and motor feedback signals with superior SNR and neuromodulation for long-term studies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural interfaces with embedded electrical functions, such as cuff electrodes, are essential for monitoring and stimulating peripheral nerves. Still, several challenges remain with cuff electrodes because sutured devices can damage the nerve by high pressure and the secured contact of electrodes with the nerve is hard to accomplish, which however is essential in maintaining electrical performance. Here, a sutureless soft-actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) that can envelop the nerve conveniently by creating a bent shape controlled upon fluid injection, is introduced. Moreover, fluid injection protrudes part of the device where electrodes are formed, thereby achieving minimized, soft but secure contact between the electrodes and the nerve. In vivo results demonstrate the successful recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves over time up to 6 weeks. While securing contact with the nerve, the implanted electrodes can preserve the nerve intact with no reduction in blood flow, thereby indicating only minimal compressive force applied to the nerve. The SACE is expected to be a promising tool for recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves toward bidirectional neuroprostheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A robust photo&#8208;/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures has been developed through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface demonstrates highly efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance, as well as exceptional superhydrophobicity. A key breakthrough is the resolution of the mechanical interlocking issue, a common challenge for the practical application of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces present a promising energy&#8208;saving solution for anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing, offering effective icing delay and photothermal de&#8208;icing capabilities. However, a significant challenge in their practical application is the mechanical interlocking of micro&#8208;nanostructures with ice formed from condensed water vapor, leading to meltwater retention and compromised functionality post&#8208;de&#8208;icing. Here, a robust photo&#8208;/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures are demonstrated through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance and excellent superhydrophobicity, demonstrating an icing delay of &#8776; 1250 s, photothermal de&#8208;icing in 8 s, water contact angle of 165&#176;, and sliding angle of 0.2&#176;. Furthermore, the surface maintains efficient anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing ability and water repellency after 400 linear abrasion cycles under 0.93&#160;MPa. Remarkably, under simulated natural icing conditions, where water vapor freezes within the micro&#8208;nanostructures causing mechanical interlocking, the surface remains entirely non&#8208;wetted after photo&#8208;/electrothermal de&#8208;icing, maintaining superhydrophobicity and effectiveness for continued anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing. This exceptional performance is attributed to the designed phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures that liquefy during de&#8208;icing, significantly reducing interactions with water molecules, as quantitatively validated by molecular dynamics simulations. This work provides new perspectives and methodologies for designing and creating innovative, high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing surfaces.

         <title>Scalable Multistep Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Multifunctional and Robust Reentrant Microcavity Surfaces via a Wetting&#8208;Induced Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctionality of reentrant microcavity geometries for different materials is investigated, and a novel and efficient method for fabricating such geometry is proposed by analyzing capillary fluid behavior. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#160;printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting&#8208;induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray&#8208;coated ultraviolet&#8208;curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti&#8208;icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.

         <title>Tailorable Fluorescent Perovskite Quantum Dots for Multiform Manufacturing via Two&#8208;Step Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T&#8208;PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross&#8208;linking between PQD and thiol&#8208;ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T&#8208;PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol&#8208;ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol&#8208;ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T&#8208;PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including &#8220;double 85&#8221; aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot&#8208;die coating, inkjet printing, direct&#8208;laser writing, UV&#8208;light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T&#8208;PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Multiscale Manufacturing of Recyclable Polyimide Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. A recycling strategy is guided by molecular simulation to reach recycling of high&#8208;performance polyimide&#8208;based aerogels. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). The unique combination facilitates the sustainable utilization of outstanding aerogel composites in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.








Abstract
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. Bio&#8208;based materials present a potentially more sustainable alternative to synthetic polymers; however, it often do not yet match the performance of synthetic materials. Given the ongoing reliance on high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;environmental&#8208;impact materials, it is essential to ensure their complete recyclability. Aerogels, recognized by IUPAC as one of the top ten emerging technologies, are witnessing rapid market growth in thermal insulation and thermal protection applications. In certain applications, synthetic and composite aerogels exhibit superior performance, particularly under high temperatures. Here, molecular simulation tools are employed to elucidate the interaction forces between polymers and solvents, develop a recycling strategy for polyimide&#8208;based aerogels, and demonstrate their application in thermal protection for firefighter textiles and thermal runaway protection for Li&#8208;ion battery packs. These composites are engineered for disassembly, allowing for the complete recovery of starting materials without any degradation of components after multiple recycling cycles. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). This unique combination of outstanding performance and excellent recyclability facilitates the sustainable utilization of aerogels in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.

         <title>Stretchable Multimodal Photonic Sensor for Wearable Multiparameter Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH is developed for on&#8208;skin health monitoring. By integrating multiple sensing mechanisms in a single hydrogel&#8208;coated PDMS optical fiber (HPOF) at distinct wavelengths, the device achieves simultaneous monitoring of heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time with negligible crosstalk.








Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real&#8208;time monitoring of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers offer critical insights for early disease prediction and diagnosis. Integration of multiple modalities in a single stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would provide a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology, which, however, has yet to be achieved. Here, this work reports, for the first time, a stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH. The multimodal sensing abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to facilitate stimuli decoupling and employ a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and accuracy. To simplify sensor interrogation, spectrally&#8208;resolved multiband emissions are generated upon the excitation of a single&#8208;wavelength laser, utilizing upconversion luminescence (UCL) and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. As proof of concept, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous monitoring of the heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time, with only a single sensor.

         <title>An Adaptive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Discriminates Xylene Isomers by Shape&#8208;Responsive Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;responsive MOF is employed to discern subtle shape differences among xylene isomers. The adsorbent deforms adaptively to match the shapes of isomer molecules, translating these diverse shapes into characteristic deformation energies. With &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where deformation energy scales with the mismatch between molecular shape and pore geometry, the adsorbent energetically favors PX over other isomers, thereby achieving energy&#8208;sieving of xylene isomers.









Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers, especially para&#8208;xylene, is a crucial but challenging process in the chemical industry due to their similar molecular dimensions. Here, a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework, Ni(ina)2, (ina = isonicotinic acid) is employed to effectively discriminate xylene isomers. The adsorbent with adaptive deformation accommodates the shapes of isomer molecules, thereby translating their subtle shape differences into characteristic framework deformation energies. Through a combination of multiple local flexibility behaviors, Ni(ina)2 exhibits guest&#8208;specific structural transformations that energetically favor para&#8208;xylene over other isomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretical investigations validate this &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where the degree of structural deformation scales with the mismatch between the molecular shape and pore geometry. As a result, Ni(ina)2 achieves exceptional para&#8208;xylene selectivity in both liquid and vapor phase separations, maintaining a high para&#8208;xylene purity and productivity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy of exploiting framework flexibility to address challenging molecular separations and provides fresh insights into the design of selective adsorbents.

Polymorphing Hydrogels &#8211; Sculpting with Light
Polymorphing hydrogels can be reshaped on demand by shining light on specific areas. These hydrogels incorporate photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links, whose lengths are reversibly controlled by UV or visible light. Under UV illumination, the cross&#8208;links shorten, causing the hydrogel to contract, while exposure to visible light restores their original length. The image symbolizes this process by depicting a &#8220;VIS&#8221;ible man and &#8220;UV&#8221;men working together to sculpt the material. More details can be found in article number 2414648 by Eunjin Choi, Yeongjae Choi, and co&#8208;workers.

Organic Electronics
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction. More details can be found in article number 2406281 by Tamanna Khan, Terry McAfee, Thomas J. Ferron, Awwad Alotaibi, and Brian A. Collins.

Abstract
The efficient mitigation of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) under ambient conditions remains a challenging task. Selective adsorption offers a viable solution for the capture of low&#8208;concentration NOx from the polluted stream at low temperatures. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of NO2 adsorbents, delves into the understanding of adsorption mechanisms, and discusses the criteria for evaluating their performance. First, the present NO2 adsorbents are categorized according to their distinct characteristics. This review then provides insights into the mechanisms of adsorption, highlighting the interaction between active sites and NO2, drawing from both experimental and theoretical research. The performance of these adsorbents is also assessed, focusing on their capacity, reusability, stability and selectivity. Finally, perspectives are proposed to address the significant challenges and explore potential advancements for NO2 adsorbents, aiming to enhance their suitability for diverse practical application scenarios.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of multi&#8208;scale hierarchical structures, from molecular to macro levels, in optimizing light harvesting and photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation (SSG) systems. By tailoring materials and structures to enhance light absorption, manage thermal properties, and support effective water transport, these integrated designs advance solar&#8208;thermal desalination as a sustainable solution to water scarcity.








Abstract
Solar steam generation (SSG) presents a promising approach to addressing the global water crisis. Central to SSG is solar photothermal conversion that requires efficient light harvesting and management. Hierarchical structures with multi&#8208;scale light management are therefore crucial for SSG. At the molecular and sub&#8208;nanoscale levels, materials are fine&#8208;tuned for broadband light absorption. Advancing to the nano&#8208; and microscale, structures are tailored to enhance light harvesting through internal reflections, scattering, and diverse confinement effects. At the macroscopic level, light capture is optimized through rationally designed device geometries, configurations, and arrangements of solar absorber materials. While the performance of SSG relies on various factors including heat transport, physicochemical interactions at the water/air and material/water interfaces, salt dynamics, etc., efficient light capture and utilization holds a predominant role because sunlight is the sole energy source. This review focuses on the critical, yet often underestimated, role of hierarchical light harvesting/management at different dimensional scales in SSG. By correlating light management with the structure&#8208;property relationships, the recent advances in SSG are discussed, shedding light on the current challenges and possible future trends and opportunities in this domain.

         <title>Linking Nanoscopic Insights to Millimetric&#8208;Devices in Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review sheds light on the most detrimental nanoscopic phase impurities in FA&#8208;rich perovskite PVs and further, highlights research directions that can mitigate their formation in the final films. The objective is to provide fundamental guidelines for engineering state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FA&#8208;rich perovskite absorbers pairing exceptional performance and prolonged device stability.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;perovskite semiconductors have a high potential for use in single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Despite their unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for photovoltaic (PV) applications, it remains unclear whether perovskite solar modules can reach a sufficient operational lifetime. In order to make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) commercially viable, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between their nanostructure, optoelectronic properties, device efficiency, and long&#8208;term operational stability/reliability needs to be established. In this review, the phase instabilities in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art formamidinium (FA)&#8208;rich perovskite absorbers is discussed. Furthermore, the concerted efforts are summarized in this prospect, covering aspects from fundamental research to device engineering. Subsequently, a critical analysis of the dictating impact of the nanoscale landscape of perovskite materials on their resulting intrinsic stability is provided. Finally, the remaining challenges in the field are assessed and future research directions are proposed for improving the operational lifetimes of perovskite devices. It is believed that these approaches, which bridge nanoscale structural properties to working solar cell devices, will be critical to assessing the realization of a bankable PSC product.

         <title>Recent Progress and Challenges of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review explores the potential of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes in next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, addressing their challenges, and degradation mechanisms, and proposing strategies for improvement and future research directions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathode materials, characterized by their high specific capacity (&gt;250 mAh g&#8722;&#185;) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, represent promising candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their commercial application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and voltage fading, which can be attributed to transition metal migration, lattice oxygen release, and the toxicity of Mn ions to the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Recently, the application of LRM cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has garnered significant interest, as this approach eliminates the liquid electrolyte, thereby suppressing transition metal crosstalk and solid&#8211;liquid interfacial side reactions. This review first examines the historical development, crystal structure, and mechanisms underlying the high capacity of LRM cathode materials. It then introduces the current challenges facing LRM cathode and the associated degradation mechanisms and proposes solutions to these issues. Additionally, it summarizes recent research on LRM materials in ASSBs and suggests strategies for improvement. Finally, the review discusses future research directions for LRM cathode materials, including optimized material design, bulk doping, surface coating, developing novel solid electrolytes, and interface engineering. This review aims to provide further insights and new perspectives on applying LRM cathode materials in ASSBs.

         <title>Advanced Ruthenium&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for NOx Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction to NH3, covering the mechanism, design, and applications. Additionally, the review presents the primary challenges relevant to relatively high cost, complex reaction mechanism, and serious hydrogen evolution, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is widely recognized as a crucial raw material for nitrogen&#8208;based fertilizer production and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen&#8208;rich fuels. Currently, the Haber&#8211;Bosch process still dominates the worldwide industrial NH3 production, which consumes substantial energy and contributes to enormous CO2 emission. As an alternative NH3 synthesis route, electrocatalytic reduction of NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, and NO) to NH3 has gained considerable attention due to its advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, sustainability, and environmental friendliness. This review timely summarizes an updated and critical survey of mechanism, design, and application of Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction. First, the reason why the Ru&#8208;based catalysts are good choice for NOx reduction to NH3 is presented. Second, the reaction mechanism of NOx over Ru&#8208;based materials is succinctly summarized. Third, several typical in situ characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetics analysis are examined. Subsequently, the construction of each classification of the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts according to the size of particles and compositions is critically reviewed. Apart from these, examples are given on the applications in the production of valuable chemicals and Zn&#8722;NOx batteries. Finally, this review concludes with a summary highlighting the main practical challenges relevant to selectivity and efficiency in the broad range of NOx concentrations and the high currents, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeted Catalytic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment, yet the low response rate remains a substantial challenge. It is crucial to gain a deep understanding of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials to enhance targeting precision and therapeutic outcomes. This review focuses on recent advances in these materials and their role in improving catalytic immunotherapy, paving the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment efficacy; however, the low response rate remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this limitation, advanced catalytic materials offer potential in augmenting catalytic immunotherapy by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through precise biochemical reactions. Achieving optimal targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy necessitates a thorough understanding of the properties and underlying mechanisms of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials and their critical role in enhancing catalytic immunotherapy. It highlights the types of catalytic reactions, the construction strategies of catalytic materials, and their fundamental mechanisms for tumor targeting, including passive, bioactive, stimuli&#8208;responsive, and biomimetic targeting approaches. Furthermore, this review outlines various tumor&#8208;specific targeting strategies, encompassing tumor tissue, tumor cell, exogenous stimuli&#8208;responsive, TME&#8208;responsive, and cellular TME targeting strategies. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges and future perspectives for transitioning catalytic materials into clinical applications, offering insights that pave the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapies and provide substantial benefits to patients in clinical settings.

&lt;p&gt;Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment efficacy; however, the low response rate remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this limitation, advanced catalytic materials offer potential in augmenting catalytic immunotherapy by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through precise biochemical reactions. Achieving optimal targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy necessitates a thorough understanding of the properties and underlying mechanisms of tumor-targeted catalytic materials. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in tumor-targeted catalytic materials and their critical role in enhancing catalytic immunotherapy. It highlights the types of catalytic reactions, the construction strategies of catalytic materials, and their fundamental mechanisms for tumor targeting, including passive, bioactive, stimuli-responsive, and biomimetic targeting approaches. Furthermore, this review outlines various tumor-specific targeting strategies, encompassing tumor tissue, tumor cell, exogenous stimuli-responsive, TME-responsive, and cellular TME targeting strategies. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges and future perspectives for transitioning catalytic materials into clinical applications, offering insights that pave the way for next-generation cancer therapies and provide substantial benefits to patients in clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Membrane Materials for Efficient Li Recycling and Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article systematically explores the recent advances in the membrane processes for lithium cycling and recovery, offering the first correlation between these technologies and technology readiness levels, unveiling the fundamentals for the lithium separation, and providing insights into the future design of membrane materials from both academic and industrial perspectives.








Abstract
Rapid uptake of lithium&#8208;centric technology, e.g., electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage, is increasing the demand for efficient technologies for lithium extraction from aqueous sources. Among various lithium&#8208;extraction technologies, membrane processes hold great promise due to energy efficiency and flexible operation in a continuous process with potential commercial viability. However, membrane separators face challenges such as the extraction efficiency due to the limited selectivity toward lithium relative to other species. Low selectivity can be ascribed to the uncontrollable selective channels and inefficient exclusion functions. However, recent selectivity enhancements for other membrane applications, such as in gas separation and energy storage, suggest that this may also be possible for lithium extraction. This review article focuses on the innovations in the membrane chemistries based on rational design following separation principles and unveiling the theories behind enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, recent progress in membrane&#8208;based lithium extraction technologies is summarized with the emphasis on inorganic, organic, and composite materials. The challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of selective membranes for lithium recovery are also pointed out.

         <title>Electrical Spin State Manipulation in All&#8208;Magnet Heterojunctions Using a Ferromagnetic Spin Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical manipulation of spins by spin Hall current from heavy metals facilitates the implementation of multifunctional spintronic devices. This work reports direct evidence of spin current generation in ferromagnets via observation of efficient current&#8208;induced switching of noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet structure. The further realization of field&#8208;free switching suggests the ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources.








Abstract
The ability to electrically manipulate spin states in magnetic materials is essential for the advancement of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic device, which is typically achieved in systems composed of a spin source and a magnetic target, where the magnetic state of the target is altered by a charge current. While theories suggest that ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources, direct experimental studies involving only the spin source and target layers have been lacking. Here electrical manipulation of spin states in noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using ferromagnets (Ni, Fe, NiFe, CoFeB) as the spin sources is reported. Both field&#8208;free switching and switching with an assistive field are achieved in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet bilayers, where the switching polarity correlates with the sign of anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnets. The experimental findings can be accounted for by the presence of spin currents arising from spin&#8208;dependent scattering within the ferromagnets. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of spin&#8208;conversion in ferromagnets, offering an alternative spin source for novel technological applications.

         <title>A Novel Matrix&#8208;Free Hyperfluorescent System Based on Anti&#8208;Quenching TADF Host for High Color Purity MR&#8208;TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an advanced design concept for matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent systems, utilizing anti&#8208;quenching TADF materials as hosts to overcome aggregation&#8208;induced challenges in traditional MR&#8208;TADF emitters by regulating the energy transfer process. Importantly, this strategy avoids complex chemical modifications of MR&#8208;TADF emitters, making them universal and low&#8208;cost, which will greatly promote the commercialization of hyperfluorescent OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on hyperfluorescent system have attracted widespread attention due to their ability to simultaneously achieve improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and color purity by combining the advantages of high exciton utilization sensitizers and high&#8208;color purity emitters. Traditional hyperfluorescent systems typically involve three or four components and are severely sensitive to the doping concentration (&#8776;0.5 wt%) of a terminal emitter, which inevitably causes high costs and difficulties in reproducibility. Here, a novel design concept for a matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent (MFHF) system that employs a combination of an anti&#8208;quenching TADF host and a high color purity MR&#8208;TADF emitter is proposed. This strategy allows traditional concentration&#8208;sensitive MR&#8208;TADF emitters to significantly improve exciton utilization and reduce exciton lifetime at high doping levels, without the need for complex molecular modifications. The OLEDs with binary emissive layer achieve pure&#8208;green emission, a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 30%, and a high maximum power efficiency of 145&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. The approach offers a straightforward and universal method to achieve anti&#8208;quenching matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent OLEDs with high color purity, making them promising for commercial applications in low&#8208;cost ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zn&#8208;SPAN Batteries with Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life of Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) battery is developed by a tandem catalytic electrolyte containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. The G4&#8211;I2 synergy activates efficient I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that inducing the generation of the predominant (002) plane.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries are a high&#8208;capacity and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co&#8208;storage of H+/Zn2+ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers.

&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries are a high-capacity and cost-effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn-sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co-storage of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with multiple redox-active centers. The reduced I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by G4 activates I&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that induces the generation of the predominant (002) plane.

         <title>Layered Deep&#8208;UV Optical Crystal KZn&#8322;BO&#8323;Br&#8322; as a High&#8208;&#954; Dielectric for 2D Electronic Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;) as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric for 2D semiconductor devices, offering a wide bandgap (&#8776;5.6 eV) and high dielectric constant (&#954;&#160;=&#160;13.5). KZBB/MoS&#8322; FETs demonstrate excellent performance, including steep subthreshold swing, high on/off ratio, minimal hysteresis, and low leakage, highlighting AZBX's potential for advanced 2D electronics.









Abstract
The development of dielectrics with atomic planes and van der Waals (vdW) interfaces is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D devices. However, vdW dielectrics often have smaller bandgaps compared to traditional 3D dielectrics, limiting their options. This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;, where A&#160;=&#160;K or Rb, X&#160;=&#160;Cl or Br), a nonlinear deep&#8208;ultraviolet optical crystal, as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric ideal for 2D electronic devices. Focusing on KZBB, it's excellent dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap, high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;), and smooth interfaces are demonstrated. When used as the top gate dielectric in a KZBB/MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with MoS&#8322; channels and graphene contacts, the device exhibits outstanding performance, with a steep subthreshold swing (&#8776; 73&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off ratio (&#8776; 10&#8311;), negligible hysteresis (0&#8211;8 mV), and stable, low leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#8311; A&#160;cm&#8722;2) before breakdown. This work expands the 2D material and dielectric landscape and highlights the strong potential of AZBX as high&#8208;performance dielectrics.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling Reaction Over an Atomically Dispersed Iron Loaded Defective TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids with a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2% is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.








Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids via the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling attracted extensive attention owing to the mild reaction conditions, controllable reaction parameters, and atom economy. However, the &#945;&#8208;amino acid yield remains unsatisfying. Herein, the efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst (adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti). The desired electrocatalyst composition for the hydrogenation of oxime is screened. The prepared adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti exhibited a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2%. The electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that atomically dispersed Fe (adFe) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhanced the adsorption of glyoxylic acid (GA), glyoxylic oxime (GO), and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). adFe sites further promote the step of H2NO* &#8594; H2NOH* in the conversion of NO3&#8722; to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the step of NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* &#8594; NH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* in the reduction of GO to glycine. The coupling pathway and the critical intermediate are revealed by synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Additionally, six other &#945;&#8208;amino acids are successfully synthesized by the adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti, showcasing its versatility in the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Conjugation Chemistry Markedly Impacts Toxicity and Biodistribution of Targeted Nanoparticles, Mediated by Complement Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugation chemistries are a critical technology in nanomedicine, enabling precise functionalization of nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., via attachment of targeting moieties). This work investigates how conjugation chemistry impacts nanoparticle&#8208;induced complement activation. The results demonstrate that modern conjugation chemistries, although bio&#8208;orthogonal, are not innocuous and must be chosen with opsonins like complement in mind.









Abstract
Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody&#8208;drug conjugates to antibody&#8208;targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody&#8208;targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140&#8208;fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click&#8208;chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.

         <title>Matrix Viscoelasticity Controls Differentiation of Human Blood Vessel Organoids into Arterioles and Promotes Neovascularization in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for differentiating arterioles in human blood vessel organoids is presented. Matrix viscoelasticity for hBVO vessel sprouting is manipulated by synthesizing dynamic and non&#8208;dynamic hydrogels. Dynamic hydrogels stimulate angiogenesis in hBVOs, generate unique smooth muscle cells, and facilitate the formation of arterioles that contribute to neovascularization following a myocardial infarction.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived blood vessel organoids are embedded in extracellular matrices to stimulate vessel sprouting. Although vascular organoids in 3D collagen I&#8208;Matrigel gels are currently available, they are primarily capillaries composed of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and mesenchymal stem&#8208;like cells, which necessitate mature arteriole differentiation for neovascularization. In this context, the hypothesis that matrix viscoelasticity regulates vascular development is investigated in 3D cultures by encapsulating blood vessel organoids within viscoelastic gelatin/&#946;&#8208;CD assembly dynamic hydrogels or methacryloyl gelatin non&#8208;dynamic hydrogels. The vascular organoids within the dynamic hydrogel demonstrate enhanced angiogenesis and differentiation into arterioles containing smooth muscle cells. The dynamic hydrogel mechanical microenvironment promotes vascular patterning and arteriolar differentiation by elevating notch receptor 3 signaling in mesenchymal stem cells and downregulating platelet&#8208;derived growth factor B expression in ECs. Transplantation of vascular organoids in vivo, along with the dynamic hydrogel, leads to the reassembly of arterioles and restoration of cardiac function in infarcted hearts. These findings indicate that the viscoelastic properties of the matrix play a crucial role in controlling the vascular organization and differentiation processes, suggesting an exciting potential for its application in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Chiton&#8208;Inspired Composites Synergizing Strength and Toughness Through Sinusoidal Interlocking Interfaces for Protective Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiton Lepidozona coreanica wisely uses the sinusoidal interlocking interface to make up for the short board of the cross&#8208;lamellar structures. Inspired by this, a chiton&#8208;inspired composite integrating cross&#8208;lamellar architecture and sinusoidal interlocking interface is proposed. The chiton&#8208;inspired composite has the high strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loads, and has promising application prospects in the field of protection.








Abstract
Introducing biological structures into materials design is expected to develop strong and tough structural materials. However, multiple interfaces are introduced simultaneously. They are always the weakest part of load transfer, becoming a critical vulnerability and failure&#8208;prone area. Here, it is the first found that the chiton achieves superior mechanical properties just by incorporating a unique sinusoidal interlocking interface into cross&#8208;lamellar architecture. These special interlocking interfaces make the chiton shell achieve damage delocalization and increase the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, this &#8220;pre&#8208;engineered&#8221; path significantly increases the travel path of the cracks and balances the strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loading. Inspired by this, a novel chiton&#8208;inspired composite is proposed. Through coupling the cross&#8208;lamellar structures and sinusoidal interlocking interfaces, its strength and toughness are increased by 88% and 107% under quasi&#8208;static loading, as well as by 17.8% and 52.4% under impact loading, respectively. These unusual interfaces make up the weak point of cross&#8208;lamellar structures and provide insights into the longer evolution of structural materials.

         <title>Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Protein Degradation Through Endocytosis Pathway Triggered by Polyvalent Nano&#8208;Chimera for AD Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work achieves the polyvalent binding between receptors and ligands through the regulation of ligand density in nano&#8208;system that functioned with precise drug delivery, thereby successfully triggers the lysosome&#8208;targeting protein degradation through endocytosis pathway. Ultimately, the nano&#8208;degrader realizes Alzheimer's disease therapy by modulating the targeted pathological membrane proteins on the damaged blood&#8208;brain barrier.








Abstract
The excessive up&#8208;regulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well&#8208;known pathological marker, drives the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although lysosome&#8208;targeting protein degradation has emerged as an effective therapeutic modality, the limited lysosome&#8208;sorting efficacy greatly hindered the degradation efficiency of target proteins. Herein, a lysosome&#8208;shuttle&#8208;like nano&#8208;chimera (endoTAC) is proposed based on polyvalent receptor binding mode for enhanced RAGE degradation as well as precise drug delivery. The endoTAC shows a high affinity to RAGE and enhances RAGE degradation due to its polyvalent&#8208;interaction with RAGE. Additionally, endoTAC features increased accumulation in diseased brain and shows promise as a precise brain delivery system. After loading with simvastatin, the SV@endoTAC proves to successfully reverse pathological features both in vitro and in vivo. The work proposes that the combination of a lysosome&#8208;targeting chimera and an effective drug delivery system can be promising in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

         <title>1D Flat Bands in Phosphorene Nanoribbons with Pentagonal Nature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic flat bands are conducive to the emergence of strongly interacting phases of matter. In this work, by reducing dimensionality into 1D, it is experimentally constructed ideal flat bands, derived from 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, in two phases of phosphorene nanoribbons with a pentagonal nature, by providing direct evidence via the ARPES measurements and atomically resolved STS mapping.








Abstract
Materials with flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moir&#233; systems. Here, a general way is reported to construct 1D flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with a pentagonal nature: penta&#8208;hexa&#8208;PNRs and penta&#8208;dodeca&#8208;PNRs, wherein the corresponding 1D flat bands are directly verified by using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight&#8208;binding models, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.

         <title>Thermal Annealing for High Performance and Memory Behavior in n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of the n&#8208;type mixed conductor has a profound effect on its crystallinity, enhancing electronic mobility and decreasing water uptake during electrochemical charging. This new microstructure imparts an &#8220;ionic memory&#8221; behavior to the material. Leveraging the polymer's sensitivity to light, this work demonstrates the first NIR light&#8208;induced conductance modulation of a mixed conductor in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
N&#8208;type organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (n&#8208;OMIECs) struggle to match the performance of p&#8208;type counterparts, particularly in bioelectronics' flagship device, the organic electrochemical transistor. Enhancing n&#8208;type transistor performance typically necessitates the synthesis of new materials. More sustainable post&#8208;synthetic treatments, known to improve organic devices in dry and oxygen&#8208;free conditions, are not applied to n&#8208;OMIECs. This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n&#8208;OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI&#8208;gT2), the first designed n&#8208;OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new&#8208;generation NDI&#8208;based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency&#8208;dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water&#8208;compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light. This simple device can be implemented in artificial neural networks and face recognition platforms and achieve vector&#8208;matrix multiplication when fabricated in an array form, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in bioelectronics.

This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n-OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI-gT2), the first designed n-OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new-generation NDI-based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency-dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water-compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light. This simple device can be implemented in artificial neural networks and face recognition platforms and achieve vector-matrix multiplication when fabricated in an array form, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Isolation Chip Integrated with Multicolor Barcode Array for High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Exosome Profiling in Tissue Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell exosome quantification and phenotyping platform using a gentle and efficient photothermal&#8208;driven chip. It achieves &#8776;97% single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency in 5 min, enabling precise exosome analysis of breast cancer cell lines and clinical tissues at the single&#8208;cell level, revealing unique exosome secretion characteristics of subgroups, and providing valuable insights for single&#8208;cell exosome analysis in cancer research.








Abstract
Exosomes, functional biomarkers involved in cancer progression, have gained widespread attention for promoting tumor formation, growth, and metastasis. Current bulk exosome detections in bodily fluids enable cancer functional analysis, but average secretion levels from cell populations, losing parent cell information and ignoring exosome heterogeneity from diverse cell subgroups, necessitating an effective platform for analyzing single&#8208;cell exosome functional heterogeneity. Here, a high&#8208;throughput platform is presented, capable of efficient single&#8208;cell isolation and multi&#8208;color exosome phenotype analysis, as well as quantifying trace exosomes secreted by single cells. Photothermal&#8208;driven single&#8208;cell chips achieve significant single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency (&#8776;97%) within 5 min, facilitating the ultra&#8208;high throughput single&#8208;cell exosome analysis. By conducting mass spectrometry and protein interaction of breast cancer exosome phenotypic proteins, key exosome phenotypes are identified. Tens of thousands of single cells from breast cancer cell lines, and clinical tissues are analyzed, revealing various subgroup differences. The study finds more CD44 and EGFR co&#8208;expressing exosome subgroups in breast cancer cell lines, while immune&#8208;evasion PD&#8208;L1 high&#8208;phenotype exosome subgroups are primarily presented in complex tumor microenvironments, especially in HER2&#8208;positive tissues. This platform offers powerful single&#8208;cell isolation, exosome quantification, and phenotypic analysis capabilities, making it a powerful tool for advancing single&#8208;cell exosome analysis in cancer research.

         <title>Dimethylamine Bismuth Iodide: A Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Enabling Ultra&#8208;Sensitive UVC Photodetection with Low Operating Voltage and High Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable lead&#8208;free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead&#8208;free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05&#160;V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 &#215; 104, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 &#215; 1013 Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high&#8208;energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A&#160;W&#8722;1) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low&#8208;cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.

         <title>Large Area Near&#8208;Field Thermophotovoltaics for Low Temperature Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics promise high output power from low temperature thermal sources, but demonstrating large area devices has proven challenging. Here a novel epitaxial co&#8208;designed emitter&#8208;cell device fabricated with scalable processes demonstrates 1.2 mW from a 460&#160;&#176;C heat source, a greater than 20&#8208;fold enhancement over the far&#8208;field. Modeling of various cell changes offers a pathway to even higher power.








Abstract
Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar&#8208;thermal power generation. However, conventional far&#8208;field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here a large area near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaic device is presented, created with an epitaxial co&#8208;fabrication approach, that consists of a self&#8208;supported 0.28 cm2 emitter&#8208;cell pair with a 150&#160;nm gap. The device generates 1.22&#160;mW at 460&#160;&#176;C, a 25&#8208;fold increase over the same cell measured in a far&#8208;field configuration. Furthermore, the near&#8208;field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far&#8208;field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.

         <title>High Defect Tolerance Breaking the Design Limitation of Full&#8208;Spectrum Multimodal Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, with a high defect tolerance structure, is used to develop single&#8208;component multimodal luminescence materials. Almost all luminescent modes and full&#8208;spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting application.








Abstract
With the development of optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high&#8208;level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up&#8208;conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X&#8208;ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full&#8208;spectrum (from violet to near&#8208;infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices, including the quasi&#8208;dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi&#8208;color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross&#8208;field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Achieved by Synergistically Enhanced Screening Li+ Desolvation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of pore sieving effect toward Li+ desolvation, the intentionally&#8208;introduced polar electron&#8208;donated chemical groups on metal&#8211;organic frameworks is developed to further boost Li+ desolvation and Li0 diffusion kinetics under low temperature, achieving uniform lithium distribution without dendrite formation. As a result, the high capacity&#8208;retention ratio of 97% is stabilized under negative/positive ratio of 3.3 and lower temperature surroundings.








Abstract
Lithium metal anode is desired by high capacity and low potential toward higher energy density than commercial graphite anode. However, the low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short&#160;lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li+ desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the &#9472;NH2 polar chemical groups,&#160;reducing energy barriers for realizing non&#8208;dendritic and smooth Li metal plating. Consequently, the optimal cells stabilize for&#160;long lifespan of 2000 h and higher average Coulombic efficiency, much better than the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;art reports. Under a lower negative/positive ratio of 3.3, the full cells with NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 deliver a high capacity&#8208;retention of 97.0% at 0.33 C even under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, showing the great potential of this kind of polar groups on boosting Li+ desolvation kinetics at room&#8208; and low&#8208;temperatures.

         <title>Ru&#8208;OV Site&#8208;Mediated Product Selectivity Switch for Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high selectivity in overall CO2 photoreduction is crucial for advancing carbon neutrality and sustainable energy development. This study innovatively establishes dual&#8208;functional active sites comprised of adjacent Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies, stabilizing pivotal intermediates while enhancing local mass transport, thereby achieving the selective overall CO2 photoreduction to CH4.








Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process. This work establishes Ru&#8208;OV active sites on the surface of TiO2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single&#8208;atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (OV) inhibits the desorption of *CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction. This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH4 instead of CO. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;OV/TiO2 exhibits a 195.4&#8208;fold improvement in the CH4 yield compared to TiO2, accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81%.

         <title>Mechanism of Hot&#8208;Carrier Photoluminescence in Sn&#8208;Based Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustrating the two dominant processes in tin&#8208;iodide perovskites at the band edge: 1) Filling of carriers at the band edge extrema as they cool. 2) Cooling of carriers emitting a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. The inset shows the dephasing of a longitudinal optical phonon studied by impulsive vibrational spectroscopy in this work.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptionally slow hot&#8208;carrier cooling, which has been attributed to various physical mechanisms without reaching a consensus. Here, experiment and theory are combined to unveil the carrier cooling process in formamidinium (FA) and caesium (Cs) tin triiodide thin films. Through impulsive vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, much shorter phonon dephasing times of the hybrid perovskite, which accounts for the larger blueshift in the photoluminescence seen at high excitation density for FASnI3 compared to CsSnI3 is reported. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the largest contribution to the blueshift is accounted by a giant, dynamic band&#8208;filling effect in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, which in turn can explain the cooling disparity with the Pb&#8208;based counterparts. Several years after the first experimental observations, here a deeper understanding of the cooling mechanism of these materials is provided. Design principles for hot&#8208;carrier materials, which may be useful for future implementations of hot&#8208;carrier solar cells are further provided.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Vitrimer Nanocomposites: Photo&#8208;Thermal Repair, Reinforcement, and Conductivity at Low Volume Fractions Through a Percolative Voronoi&#8208;Inspired Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils MXene&#8208;vitrimer nanocomposites with a distinct biphasic Voronoi&#8208;inspired microstructure, where a percolative MXene minor&#8208;phase spans throughout a vitrimer major&#8208;phase. Fabricated via a streamlined three&#8208;step process of precipitation polymerization, MXene aqueous coating, and melt&#8208;pressing, these nanocomposites deliver photo&#8208;thermal repairability, mechanical reinforcement, and conductivity at low loadings, achieving greatly diminished percolation thresholds and multifunctionality for advanced smart materials and sustainable composites.








Abstract
An innovative process to multifunctional vitrimer nanocomposites with a percolative MXene minor phase is reported, marking a significant advancement in creating stimuli&#8208;repairable, reinforced, sustainable, and conductive nanocomposites at diminished loadings. This achievement arises from a Voronoi&#8208;inspired biphasic morphological design via a straight&#8208;forward three&#8208;step process involving ambient&#8208;condition precipitation polymerization of micron&#8208;sized prepolymer powders, aqueous powder&#8208;coating with 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tz), and melt&#8208;pressing of MXene&#8208;coated powders into crosslinked films. Due to the formation of MXene&#8208;rich boundaries between thiourethane vitrimer domains in a pervasive low&#8208;volume fraction conductive network, a low percolation threshold (&#8776;0.19&#160;vol.%) and conductive polymeric nanocomposites (&#8776;350 S&#160;m&#8722;1) are achieved. The embedded MXene skeleton mechanically bolsters the vitrimer at intermediate loadings, enhancing the modulus and toughness by 300% and 50%, respectively, without mechanical detriment compared to the neat vitrimer. The vitrimer's dynamic&#8208;covalent bonds and MXene's photo&#8208;thermal conversion properties enable repair in minutes through short&#8208;term thermal treatments for full macroscopic mechanical restoration or in seconds under 785&#160;nm light for rapid localized surface repair. This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre&#8208;vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next&#8208;generation smart materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nano&#8208;Regulator Unleashes Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity by Overcoming Dendritic Cell Tolerance and T Cell Exhaustion in Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) engineered to reprogram dendritic cells (DCs) within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), significantly enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The DNR employs a dual TLR activation strategy, simultaneously mitigating immune checkpoint suppression. This targeted approach directly addresses DC tolerance and T cell exhaustion, effectively restoring robust anti&#8208;tumor responses.








Abstract
Lymph nodes are crucial immune foci as the primary target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the anti&#8208;tumor functions of tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critically suppressed by tumors. Here, a novel spatiotemporal nano&#8208;regulator is presented, designed to modulate the dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, establishing a supportive niche for immune surveillance. The DC&#8208;mediated nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) is established by the self&#8208;assembly of an imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) prodrug, inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) siRNA, and mannan (a TLR4 agonist). This unique design leverages the spatiotemporal activation of TLR4 and TLR7/8, thereby optimizing DC maturation and cytokine production. This further promotes efficient T cell priming. Simultaneously, the ICP&#8208;targeting siRNA mitigates the tolerogenic effects induced by tumor&#8208;derived factors and TLR activation, preventing T cell exhaustion. In essence, DNR facilitates potent remodeling of TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment, activating the anti&#8208;tumor immunity cascade. When combined with vaccines, DNR greatly promotes tumor regression and the establishment of long&#8208;term immunological memory.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Nanoaggregates for NIR LED&#8208;Driven Sustained Mild Photothermal Therapy Achieving Complete Tumor Eradication and Immune Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is presented, utilizing gold nanoparticle aggregates (AuNAs) with an impressive photothermal efficiency of up to 92.8%. This strategy employs low&#8208;power LED irradiation to achieve complete tumor eradication while enhancing safety and immune responses. The findings indicate that this approach has significant potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes and expanding the applicability of photothermal therapy.








Abstract
For millennia, humans have harnessed thermal energy to treat cancer. However, delivering energy to tumor tissues in traditional hyperthermia remains a significant challenge. Nanotechnology has revolutionized this approach, enabling nanomaterials to target tumors precisely and act as internal heat sources. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy employs nano&#8208;photothermal agents to absorb near&#8208;infrared light and convert it into heat, offering non&#8208;invasive, highly controllable, and specific treatment for solid tumors. Nonetheless, achieving complete tumor eradication, preventing recurrence, and ensuring safety continue to be major concerns. To address these issues, sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is proposed, utilizing gold nanoaggregates (AuNAs) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (92.8%) in combination with a single irradiation of low&#8208;power (&#8764;0.1 W&#160;cm&#8722;2) sustained LED light. This method achieved complete tumor eradication in animal models, with no recurrence over long&#8208;term (&gt;180 days) monitoring. This strategy provides superior therapeutic effects compared to mild photothermal therapy and higher safety than high&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy. Additionally, it induces a strong immune response and immune memory, crucial for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This novel approach to photothermal therapy may significantly impact clinical applications for shallow tumor treatment and offer new avenues for immunotherapy.

         <title>Suspending Light&#8208;Absorbing Nanoparticles in Silica Aerogel Enables Numerous Superblacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous superblacks are fabricated via generally suspending individual light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in man&#8208;made solid smoke.








Abstract
Current strategies for constructing sparse nanostructures for fabricating superblacks are only suitable for a few light&#8208;absorbing materials, severely limiting their applications. Herein, ultra&#8208;low reflective silica aerogels with ultra&#8208;high light transparency are used as solid smokes to individually or simultaneously suspend at least 100 species of light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles with a volume fraction as low as 0.005%, for creating &gt; 100 superblacks in practice and one billion superblacks in theory if taken permutation and combination among these 0D, 1D, or 2D nanoparticles into account. Depending on the composition of suspended nanoparticles and the structure of solid smoke, the resulting mechanically robust superblacks with supplementary properties including magnetism, full&#8208;spectrum absorption, high thermal stability, and excellent mechanical strength, are first observed. The wide choice of metallic or semiconductive LNs allows as&#8208;made superblacks to glitter in different catalytic reactions, and the resulting superblacks have been on&#8208;demand modified for endowing the self&#8208;cleaning performance in some contaminable environments. Benefiting from the superblack feature and porous network, these superblack monoliths have shown high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;heat conversion in some emerging light harvesting and managing fields. This powerful synthetic strategy for superblacks is expected to inspire researchers to conduct in&#8208;depth investigations on super&#8208;black optics, functional materials, etc.

         <title>Living Porous Ceramics for Bacteria&#8208;Regulated Gas Sensing and Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous ceramics colonized by bacteria can achieve self&#8208;regulated, programmable carbon capture and gas&#8208;sensing functions. The porosity of the ceramic scaffold enables autonomous nutrient transport through capillary forces, enabling microbial growth without external energy. Using wild&#8208;type cyanobacteria and engineered&#160;E. coli, living porous ceramics are created to capture CO2 directly from the air and convert toxic gases into human&#8208;detectable benign scents.








Abstract
Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense, and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, porous ceramics are reported that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self&#8208;regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas&#8208;sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild&#8208;type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas&#8208;sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as a ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake, and mechanical properties. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical analysis techniques, the ability of the living porous ceramics are demonstrated to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.

         <title>Synergistic Acid&#8208;Base Action Leads to Ultrafast Decontamination of Nerve and Blister Agents by OH&#8722; Intercalated Zr4+&#8208;Doped MgAl&#8208;LDH under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH achieves ultrafast decontamination of nerve and blister agents under ambient conditions with the synergistic effect of Zr4+ and bridging/terminal hydroxyl in the laminates and OH&#8722; in the interlayers, remarkably sets the record for the shortest decontamination half&#8208;life for DECP and GD. Further, self&#8208;detoxifying protective fibers are prepared using Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH as a catalytic component.








Abstract
Developing materials capable of rapidly decontaminating nerve and blister agents directly under ambient conditions are crucial for practical applications. In this work, Mg3Al1&#8208;xZrx&#8208;LDH with different Zr4+ doping contents and corresponding OH&#8722; intercalated materials Mg3Al1&#8208;xZrx&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH are synthesized. First, they are used for the decontamination of nerve agents under ambient conditions, showing that increasing the Zr4+ doping amount accelerates the decontamination rate of diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) and soman (GD), with the half&#8208;life of DECP and GD being 3&#8211;5 times shorter with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH (the highest Zr4+ doping content) compared to Mg3Al1&#8208;LDH. Notably, the intercalation of OH&#8722; in Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH further greatly enhances the catalytic activity for DECP and GD, the reaction half&#8208;life of DECP and GD with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH being 18&#160;s and &lt;15&#160;s, respectively, which is the shortest recorded so far. Additionally, under ambient conditions, Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH exhibits superior detoxification performance for mustard gas (HD) compared to Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH, with 92.8% of HD being removed within 6&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH efficiently decontaminates nerve and blister agents utilizing the synergistic effect of Lewis acid&#8208;base sites (Zr4+ and laminate OH groups) and interlayer OH&#8722;. To extend the practical applications of the materials, PVA@(PAN/LDH&#8208;OH) self&#8208;detoxifying fiber loaded with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH is prepared.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesized Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH-OH achieves ultrafast decontamination of nerve and blister agents under ambient conditions with the synergistic effect of Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and bridging/terminal hydroxyl in the laminates and OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in the interlayers, remarkably sets the record for the shortest decontamination half-life for DECP and GD. Further, self-detoxifying protective fibers are prepared using Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH-OH as a catalytic component.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing materials capable of rapidly decontaminating nerve and blister agents directly under ambient conditions are crucial for practical applications. In this work, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Zr&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-LDH with different Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; doping contents and corresponding OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalated materials Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;1-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Zr&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-LDH-OH are synthesized. First, they are used for the decontamination of nerve agents under ambient conditions, showing that increasing the Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; doping amount accelerates the decontamination rate of diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) and soman (GD), with the half-life of DECP and GD being 3&#8211;5 times shorter with Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH (the highest Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; doping content) compared to Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH. Notably, the intercalation of OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; in Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH further greatly enhances the catalytic activity for DECP and GD, the reaction half-life of DECP and GD with Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH-OH being 18&#160;s and &amp;lt;15&#160;s, respectively, which is the shortest recorded so far. Additionally, under ambient conditions, Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH-OH exhibits superior detoxification performance for mustard gas (HD) compared to Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH, with 92.8% of HD being removed within 6&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH-OH efficiently decontaminates nerve and blister agents utilizing the synergistic effect of Lewis acid-base sites (Zr&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and laminate OH groups) and interlayer OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. To extend the practical applications of the materials, PVA@(PAN/LDH-OH) self-detoxifying fiber loaded with Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.6&lt;/sub&gt;Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.4&lt;/sub&gt;-LDH-OH is prepared.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhance Photo&#8208;Stability of Up&#8208;Scalable Organic Solar Cells: Suppressing Radical Generation in Polymer Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells with a wide thickness range fabricated by doctor&#8208;blade with non&#8208;halogenated solvents in air show strong losses in short&#8208;circuit current density under photo&#8208;thermal stress. Suppressing radical generation in polymer donors processed in air by increasing the crystallinity in unit thickness is critical for enhancing photo&#8208;stability of up&#8208;scalable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) has been promoted above 20%. Device up&#8208;scaling draws more and more research attentions. Besides the high PCE for devices with up&#8208;scalable fabrication methods and conditions, achieving high stability simultaneously is essential for pushing industrialization of this technology. Here, the stability of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs blade&#8208;coated in air with non&#8208;halogenated solvents in a wide thickness range is thoroughly investigated. The losses in short&#8208;circuit current density under photo&#8208;thermal stress strongly depend on processing conditions. Devices with less crystalline phases in unit thickness show faster generation of trap states and hence strongly reduced charge collection efficiency. Through in&#8208;depth photo&#8208;chemical, photo&#8208;physical, and morphological characterizations during ageing, faster generation of radicals in PM6 for active layers with more amorphous structures is identified as the cause for device degradation. Increasing the crystallinity of active layer films for suppressing radical generation in polymer donors is critical to enhance the photo&#8208;thermal stability of devices processed in air with a wide thickness range.

         <title>Multifunctional Microneedle Patches Loaded With Engineered Nitric Oxide&#8208;Releasing Nanocarriers for Targeted and Synergistic Chronic Wound Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds impose significant physical and mental burdens on patients. Nano&#8208;based formulations offer a promising strategy for chronic wound healing due to their non&#8208;invasive nature and enhanced biofilms penetration, but they often lack targeting capability or fail to achieve long&#8208;term and synergistic effects. In this work, a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers are presented that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds. With the assistance of MNs, the nanoparticles (NPs) can directly cross bacterial biofilms and be efficiently delivered to wound tissues, where they target harmful bacteria through the specific recognition between Con A and polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces, followed by the release of the encapsulated antimicrobial agent, thereby achieving effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the NPs generate NO in a sustained manner as they dissociate in the wound tissue, which exerts potent anti&#8208;inflammatory action and benefits tissue regeneration, further promoting chronic wounds closure. Consequently, this work provides a novel MN patch loaded with engineered NPs designed for accelerating chronic wound healing through targeted and synergistic therapy.

         <title>Thiol Carbazole Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers as Tunable Carrier Injecting Interlayers for Organic Transistors and Complementary Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;based carbazole self&#8208;assembled monolayers are synthesized and used to tune the work function of gold electrodes from 4.52 to 5.48 eV, making them suitable for application as hole or electron injecting contacts in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. Using these thiol&#8208;based monolayers, p/n&#8208;channel organic transistors and complementary inverters are demonstrated.








Abstract
The significant contact resistance at the metal&#8208;semiconductor interface is a well&#8208;documented issue for organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) that hinders device and circuit performance. Here, this issue is tackled by developing three new thiol carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules, namely tBu&#8208;2SCz, 2SCz, and Br&#8208;2SCz, and utilizing them as carrier&#8208;selective injection interlayers. The SAMs alter the work function of gold electrodes by more than 1 eV, making them suitable for use in hole and electron&#8208;transporting OTFTs. Scanning tunneling microscopy analysis indicates that 2SCz and Br&#8208;2SCz form highly ordered molecular rows, resulting in work function values of 4.86 and 5.48 eV, respectively. The latter value is higher than gold electrodes modified by the commonly used pentafluorobenzenethiol (&#8776;5.33 eV), making Br&#8208;2SCz promising for hole injection. Conversely, tBu&#8208;2SCz appears disordered with a lower work function of 4.52 eV, making it more suitable for electron injection. These intriguing properties are leveraged to demonstrate hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting OTFTs with improved operating characteristics. All&#8208;organic complementary inverters are finally demonstrated by integrating p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OTFTs, showcasing the potential of this simple yet powerful contact work function engineering approach. The present study highlights the versatility of thiol carbazole SAMs as carrier injecting interlayers for OTFTs and integrated circuits.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Multiexciton Dynamics Governs Scintillation From Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;confined nano scintillators are gaining interest in radiation detection. Understanding the nanoscale scintillation mechanism and key material parameters is crucial. These open questions are addressed by studying the scintillation of CsPbBr3 quantum dots. Increasing the particle size increases the energy deposition, the (multi&#8208;)exciton population, and the emission yield, resulting in maximized scintillation efficiency and timing. A validated theoretical model for the scintillation yield and kinetics is developed, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.








Abstract
The recent emergence of quantum&#8208;confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimization of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, these open questions are addressed by theoretically and experimentally studying the size&#8208;dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results show that the simultaneous effects of size&#8208;dependent energy deposition, (multi&#8208;)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.

     alt="Size-Dependent Multiexciton Dynamics Governs Scintillation From Perovskite Quantum Dots"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum-confined nano scintillators are gaining interest in radiation detection. Understanding the nanoscale scintillation mechanism and key material parameters is crucial. These open questions are addressed by studying the scintillation of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quantum dots. Increasing the particle size increases the energy deposition, the (multi-)exciton population, and the emission yield, resulting in maximized scintillation efficiency and timing. A validated theoretical model for the scintillation yield and kinetics is developed, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent emergence of quantum-confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimization of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, these open questions are addressed by theoretically and experimentally studying the size-dependent scintillation of CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results show that the simultaneous effects of size-dependent energy deposition, (multi-)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Piezoelectric Nanosystem for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction via Autophagy Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the study proposes a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted piezoelectric nanosystem that can promote mitophagy and ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice through ultrasound&#8208;assisted electric current generation and long&#8208;acting glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs) release, respectively. The findings reveal that this nanosystem can be employed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.








Abstract
Mitochondrial damage caused by external stimuli, such as high glucose levels and inflammation, results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Existing antioxidants can only scavenge ROS and cannot address the root cause of ROS production, namely, abnormal mitochondria. To overcome this limitation, the study develops a piezoelectric synergistic drug&#8208;loaded nanosystem (BaTCG nanosystem) that targets mitochondria. The BaTCG nanosystem is delivered to mitochondria via triphenylphosphine modification, and generates current under the stimulation of ultrasound, thereby promoting mitochondrial autophagy and restoring mitochondrial&#160; homeostasis. In a model of diabetes&#8208;related erectile dysfunction (ED), the BaTCG nanosystem, through the current induced by the piezoelectric effect, not only promoted mitophagy, thereby reducing ROS production, but also released long&#8208;acting glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs) to effectively reduce blood glucose levels and mitochondrial damage. Each component of this nanosystem functions individually as well as synergistically, thus facilitating corpus cavernosum repair and restoring erectile function. In conclusion, the findings offer a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes&#8208;related ED and a target for the treatment of diabetes&#8208;related conditions with functionalized nanoparticles to regulate mitophagy.

         <title>Functionalized Nanozyme Microcapsules Targeting Deafness Prevention via Mitochondrial Homeostasis Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized nanozyme microcapsules are established to protect cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss via mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed microcapsules reprogram the energy supply mechanism and inhibit the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the primary mechanism underlying cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss, can potentially be mitigated by modulating the redox balance and reprogramming the energy metabolism to remodel mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine&#8211;derived carbonized polymer dots (NAC CPDs) are embedded into manganese porphyrin&#8211;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks and encapsulated using a polydopamine (PDA) coating and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to afford functionalized nanozyme microcapsules. Owing to their injectability and adhesion properties, these microcapsules exhibit the advantages of prolonged retention in the middle ear and sustained release in the inner ear. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed nanozymes activate the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway, reprogramming the energy supply mechanism, and inhibiting the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c. Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.

         <title>Xolography for 3D Printing in Microgravity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography can 3D print versatile plastic and hydrogel parts in microgravity and a variety of resins can be processed independent from viscosity and flow properties. Just like on Earth, complex geometries, smooth surfaces and feature resolution down to 20&#160;&#181;m can be achieved during 20&#160;s microgravity phases in a parabolic flight experiment.








Abstract
Xolography is a volumetric 3D printing technique utilizing intersecting light beams within a volume of photopolymer for a spatially controlled photopolymerization. Unlike layer&#8208;based methods, Xolography creates structures continuously within a closed photopolymer vat, eliminating the prevalent need for support structures and allowing full geometrical freedom at high printing speeds. The volumetric working principle does not rely on gravity, making Xolography an outstanding technology for additive manufacturing under microgravity conditions as illustrated in a set of experiments during a parabolic flight campaign. The microgravity environment obviates the need for rheology control of resins, enabling the use of low&#8208;viscosity formulations (e.g., 11&#160;mPa&#160;s) while maintaining the fast and precise 3D printing of acrylic polymer resins and hydrogels. Xolography's speed and reliability facilitate rapid iterations of a print task between Earth's gravity and microgravity conditions. This capability positions Xolography as an ideal tool for material research and manufacturing in space, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional methods.

         <title>Self&#8208;Selective (220) Directional Grown Copper Current Collector Design for Cycling&#8208;Stable Anode&#8208;Less Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;selective, preferentially Li salt&#8208;adsorbing and inorganic interphase&#8208;catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self&#8208;select out its salt&#8208;philic facet growth. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet&#8208;dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33&#8211;42%.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well&#8208;known knowledge of lithium salt&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt&#8208;philic CuCC with undiscovered salt&#8208;philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self&#8208;selective and iSEI&#8208;catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface&#8208;controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self&#8208;selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt&#8208;philic facets of CuCC. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition&#8208;derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass&#8208;productivity of this self&#8208;selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch&#8208;cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self&#8208;selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high&#8208;selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Diffusion Enabled Epitaxy of the Ti&#8211;O System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin&#8208;film epitaxy of the Ti&#8211;O system at ultra&#8208;high temperatures realizes an unconventional growth mode. Above 1000&#160;&#176;C, oxygen diffusion from the substrates governs the growth dynamics and the resulting growth phase diagram appears to be against basic thermodynamics. The growth temperature selectively stabilizes the oxidation state of the Ti&#8211;O system, which demonstrates a novel self&#8208;regulated growth of epitaxial oxides.








Abstract
High temperatures promote kinetic processes that can drive crystal synthesis toward ideal thermodynamic conditions, thereby realizing samples of superior quality. While accessing very high temperatures in thin&#8208;film epitaxy is becoming increasingly accessible through laser&#8208;based heating methods, demonstrations of such utility are still emerging. The study realizes a novel self&#8208;regulated growth mode in the Ti&#8211;O system by relying on thermally activated diffusion of oxygen from an oxide substrate. The controlled diffusion enables oxidation state selectivity of single&#8208;phase films with superior crystallinity to conventional approaches as evidenced by structural and electronic measurements. The diffusion&#8208;enabled epitaxy is potentially of wide use in the growth of transition metal oxides, opening up new opportunities for ultra&#8208;high purity epitaxial platforms based on d&#8208;orbital&#160;systems.

         <title>Accelerating Tandem Electroreduction of Nitrate to Ammonia via Multi&#8208;Site Synergy in Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Supported High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallics</title>

Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles (NPs) are supported in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon farmwork and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction in ammonia synthesis. The multi&#8208;sites of the HEI NPs synergistic for a tandem reduction mechanism, where the Pt&#8208;Fe/Co/Ni/Cu bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key NOx while the Pt sites facilitate the generation of *H species.









Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3
&#8722;RR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a significant technological advancement, yet it involves a cascade of elementary reactions alongside various intermediates. Thus, the development of multi&#8208;site catalysts for enhancing NO3
&#8722;RR and understanding the associated reaction mechanisms for NH3 synthesis is vital. Herein, a versatile approach is presented to construct platinum based high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) library for NH3 synthesis. The HEI nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly supported on a 2D nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (N&#8208;mC) framework, featured with adjustable compositions (up to eight elements) and a high degree of atomic order (over 90%). Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and atomic structural analysis, a quinary Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 HEI NPs based N&#8208;mC catalyst is designed, which demonstrates a large ammonia Faradaic efffciency (&gt;97%) and a remarkable recyclability (&gt;20 cycles) under both acidic and basic conditions. The combined in situ experimental analysis and further DFT calculation suggests that the well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;sites nature of the HEI NPs cooperate for a tandem reduction mechanism, in which the Pt&#8208;X (X represents the other four transition elements) bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key nitrogen&#8211;oxygen species while the Pt sites facilitate the generation and adsorption of *H species.

         <title>Polyphenol Mediated Assembly: Tailored Nano&#8208;Dredger Unblocks Axonal Autophagosomes Retrograde Transport Traffic Jam for Accelerated Alzheimer's Waste Clearance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Customized Nano&#8208;dredger based on the complex interaction between polyphenol Lithospermic acid B (LA) and various substances, including siRNA, lipid nanovacuoles (LIP), &#949;&#8208;polylysine (&#949;PLL), achieves efficient brain&#8208;neuron targeting, enhances the operability and patency of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport and autolysosomal fusion&#8208;degradation process, thereby decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#8208;related neuronal waste burden (aberrant accumulated protein/aging organelle) and achieving neuroprotection.








Abstract
Clear&#8208;cut evidence has linked defective autophagy to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies underscore a unique hurdle in AD neuronal autophagy: impaired retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes, potent enough to induce autophagic stress and neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, pertinent therapy is unavailable. Here, a novel combinational therapy composed of siROCK2 and lithospermic acid B (LA) is introduced, tailored to dredge blocked axonal autophagy by multi&#8208;mitigating microtubule disruption, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and autophagy initiation impediments in AD. Leveraging the recent discovery of multi&#8208;interactions between polyphenol LA and siRNA, &#949;&#8208;Poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, and anionic lipid nanovacuoles, LA and siROCK2 are successfully co&#8208;loaded into a fresh nano&#8208;drug delivery system, LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC, via a ratio&#8208;flexible and straightforward fabrication process. Further modification with the TPL peptide onto LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC creates a brain&#8208;neuron targeted, biocompatible, and pluripotent nanomedicine, named &#8220;Nano&#8208;dredger&#8221; (T&#8208;LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC). Nano&#8208;dredger efficiently accelerates axonal retrograde transport and lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating the clearance of neurotoxic proteins, improving neuronal complexity, and alleviating memory defects in 3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD transgenic mice. This study provides a fresh and flexible polyphenol/siRNA co&#8208;delivery paradigm and furnishes conceptual proof that dredging axonal autophagy represents a promising AD therapeutic avenue.

         <title>Reviving Zn Dendrites to Electroactive Zn2+ by Ion Sieve Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2&#8314; diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, conventional Zn0 dendrite growth suppression strategies are shifted by introducing proactive dendrite&#8208;digesting chemistry via an ion sieve interface. This work provides unique insights into achieving reversible aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zn0 dendrite formation during repeated plating/stripping processes limits the practical use of Zn&#8208;metal anodes in reliable and affordable energy storage. Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2+ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, using an in situ pre&#8208;zincation approach, a Li2ZnxTi3&#8208;xO8 (LZTO, 0&lt;x&lt;3) layer with uniform ion channels is introduced. This layer acts as an ionic sieve, reviving Zn0 dendrite into Zn2+ through redox reactions and enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Experiment and simulation results reveal that Zn2+ migrates along the (111) crystal plane of LZTO through the successive replacement of Zn atoms in tetrahedral positions, with a high transference number of 0.796. LZTO@Zn performs better in coin cells at high currents (e.g., 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and operates at higher Zn utilization (300&#160;h at 56.98%&#160;Zn utilization), with four times the lifespan at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and six times longer in alkaline electrolytes compared to bare Zn. Pouch cells with LZTO@Zn anodes operate in a low N/P ratio (6.9) and lean electrolyte (E/C is 20&#160;&#181;L mA h&#8722;1), achieving enhanced cycling stability. The findings indicate the significance of ion sieves with ordered ion channels in mitigating Zn0 dendrites and promoting rapid Zn2+ transport.

         <title>Inverse Size&#8208;Scaling Ferroelectricity in Centrosymmetric Insulating Perovskite Oxide DyScO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In centrosymmetric DyScO3, nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;polar transition is observed by atomically&#8208;resolved electron microscopy. Driven by surface charge transfer, the asymmetric Dy&#8208;Dy split and ferrodistortive octahedral order break the inversion symmetry. The inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectricity, prevailing in many perovskites with alternatively charged AOn+ and BO2n&#8722; (n &#8800; 0) layers, opens up a new era for novel ferroelectric study at low dimension.








Abstract
The breaking of inversion symmetry dictates the emergence of electric polarization, whose topological states in superlattices and bulks have received tremendous attention for their intriguing physics brought for novel device design. However, as for substrate oxides such as LaAlO3, KTaO3, RScO3 (R = rare earth element), their centrosymmetric trivial attributes make their functionality poorly explored. Here, the discovery of nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transition in band insulator DyScO3 is reported by using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. As the free&#8208;standing specimen reduces to a critical thickness &#8776;5 nm, its inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken by surface charge transfer, which gives rise to asymmetric Dy atomic displacements and ferrodistortive octahedral order, as substantiated by the first&#8208;principles calculations. Apart from the observation of migratable polar vortex structures, the switchable electric polarization by applied electric field is demonstrated by the piezoresponse force microscopy experiments. Given the decisive role of critical size in generating ferroelectricity, a concept of &#8220;inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectric&#8221; is proposed to define a class of such materials. Distinct from the proper and improper ferroelectrics, the findings offer a new platform to explore novel low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and device applications in the future.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Antifouling Liquid&#8208;Like Surfaces for Sustainable Viscous Water&#8208;in&#8208;Oil Emulsions Separation and Oil Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel slippery surface is introduced for the enduring separation of viscous water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions through the meticulous construction of a robust, chemically cross&#8208;linked network embedding soft nanomicelles, complemented by the integration of the corrosion&#8208;resistant polystyrene. Ultimately, the coating exhibits outstanding anti&#8208;oil&#8208;adhesion properties (even viscous crude oil), and chemical and mechanical stability, preventing membrane fouling and enabling efficient sustainable high&#8208;viscosity emulsion separation.









Abstract
The demand for efficient separation techniques in industries dealing with high viscosity emulsions has surged due to their widespread applications in various scenarios, including emulsion&#8208;based drug delivery systems, the removal of emulsified impurities in formulations and oil spill remediation. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge for conventional separation methods, leading to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance costs. Herein, a novel approach is reported by constructing liquid&#8208;like surfaces with double anti&#8208;fouling structure, incorporating soft nanomicelles within a rigid, chemically cross&#8208;linked network for both anti&#8208;membrane&#8208;fouling and effective viscous water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion separation. The coating significantly outperforms perfluorinated and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PVDF) membranes, effectively preventing the adhesion of viscous oils like crude oil and pump oil, and alleviating severe membrane fouling. For high&#8208;viscosity emulsions (97.3 cP and 52.8 cP), it maintains over 99% separation efficiency after 3&#160;h continuous use. Even after 15&#160;h immersion in strong acids, alkalis, salts, or organic solvents, its separation efficiency remains above 95%. In addition, thanks to the anti&#8208;membrane&#8208;fouling ability, this work achieved 6&#160;h continuous emulsion separation performance for the first time, demonstrating unparalleled long&#8208;term stability. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the development of innovative coatings for efficient and eco&#8208;friendly separation of high&#8208;viscosity emulsions.

         <title>Sign&#8208;Switchable Poisson's Ratio Design for Bimodal Strain&#8208;to&#8208;Electrical Signal Transducing Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy for constructing hybrid materials with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio is developed, enabling the material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. Upon integrating a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film onto its surface, the device can switch its strain&#8208;resistance response between strain&#8208;insensitive and strain&#8208;dependent states due to the varying deformation characteristics.








Abstract
Stretchable electronic devices that conduct strain&#8208;related electronic performances have drawn extensive attention, functioning as mechanical sensors, actuators, and stretchable conductors. Although strain&#8208;insensitive or strain&#8208;responsive nature is well&#8208;achieved separately, it remains challenging to combine these two characteristics in one single device, which will offer versatile adaptability in various working situations. Herein, a hybrid material with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio (SSPR) is developed by combining a phase&#8208;change gel based reentrantreentrant honeycomb pattern and a polydimethylsiloxane film. The phase&#8208;change gel featuring thermally&#8208;regulated Young's modulus enables the hybrid material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. After integrating with a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film, the obtained stretchable device performs bimodal strain&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing (Bi&#8208;SET) functions, in which the SSPR&#8208;dominated strain&#8208;resistance response switches between strain&#8208;dependent and strain&#8208;insensitive behaviors. As a proof of concept, a mode&#8208;switchable grasping system is constructed using a Bi&#8208;SET device&#8208;based controller, enabling the adaptation of grasping behaviors to various target objects.

         <title>Optically Pumped and Electrically Switchable Microlaser Array Based on Elliptic Deformation and Q&#8208;Attenuation of Organic Droplet Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically pumped and electrically Q&#8208;switchable minute laser oscillators are invented. The oscillator is made from a robust self&#8208;standing organic droplet that deforms into a prolate spheroid under an electric field. The deformation induces the attenuation of the quality factor, leading to a halt of the laser emission. An array of droplet lasers is also demonstrated as a prototype laser display.








Abstract
Conventional laser panel displays are developed through the mass integration of electrically pumped lasers or through the incorporation of a beam steering system with an array of optically pumped lasers. Here a novel configuration of a laser panel display consisting of a non&#8208;steered pumping beam and an array of electrically Q&#8208;switchable lasers is reported. The laser oscillator consists of a robust, self&#8208;standing, and deformable minute droplet that emits laser through Whispering&#8208;Gallery Mode resonance when optically pumped. The laser oscillation is electrically switchable during optical pumping by applying a vertical electric field to the droplet. Electromagnetic and fluid dynamics simulations reveal the deformation of the droplet into a prolate spheroid under the electric field and associated attenuation of quality factor (Q&#8208;factor), leading to the halt of the laser oscillation. A 2 &#215; 3 array of droplets is fabricated by inkjet printing as a prototype of a laser panel display, and it successfully achieves the pixel&#8208;selective switching of the oscillation.

         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;color QD lasers relevant for practical implementations are achieved. These QD lasers feature the simultaneous metrics of low threshold, long operating duration, and multimilliwatt output power under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping. To the best of the available knowledge, the multimilliwatt output power has never been realized in QD lasers before. These results open the door to practical QD lasers.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive gain materials owing to the wide range of accessible colors. However, the existing QD lasers struggle to combine technologically relevant metrics of low threshold and long operating duration with considerable output powers. Here a new class of full&#8208;color QD lasers are reported, featuring low threshold, uninterrupted operation for dozens of hours, and multimilliwatt output under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping, by coupling the high&#8208;gain QDs with a double&#8208;clad pumping scheme. Corroborated by the comprehensive transient spectroscopy and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the ternary QDs with specially designed fine nanostructure enable the low gain threshold, giant gain coefficient, long gain lifetime, and excellent resistance against intense photoexcitation. Meanwhile, the double&#8208;clad QD&#8208;fiber design allows for record&#8208;long light&#8208;gain interaction, high conversion efficiency, and sustained device operation. As such, the QD lasers with multimilliwatt output powers, unobserved in QD lasers to date, have been realized. Further, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for generating vortex beams with various topological charges is demonstrated. This work represents significant progress toward practical lasers based on QDs.

         <title>Efficient Gate&#8208;Tunable Hot&#8208;Carrier Photocurrent from Perovskite Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot carrier devices with low&#8208;dimensional semiconductor heterostructures are promising for enhancing photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion beyond the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. This study presents a 2D Van der Waals heterostructure device made of 2D perovskite quantum wells and few&#8208;layer MoS&#8322;. The device shows efficient gate&#8208;tunable hot&#8208;hole photocurrent and high external quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier relaxation above the bandgap results in significant energy losses, making the extraction of hot carriers a critical challenge for efficient hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent generation in devices. In this study, we observe long&#8208;lived hot carriers in the metal&#8208;halide perovskite multiple quantum wells, (BA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3), and demonstrate effective hot&#8208;hole photocurrent generation using 2D&#160;MoS&#8322; as an extraction layer. A high external quantum efficiency of short&#8208;circuit hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent of up to 35.4% is achieved. Further enhancement in photocurrent efficiency and open&#8208;circuit photovoltage is achieved when a gate electric field is applied, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of up to 61.9%. Evidence of hot&#8208;hole extraction is validated through operando transient reflection measurements on the working devices, with studies that depend on wavelength, carrier density, and gate voltage. DFT calculations on the heterostructure devices under different bias voltages further elucidate the mechanism of hot&#8208;hole extraction enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of perovskite multiple quantum wells as long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carrier generators and highlight the role of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors as efficient hot&#8208;carrier extraction electrodes for low&#8208;power optoelectronics.

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Adaptive Heteroepitaxy of 2D Cesium Bismuth Halides with Engineered Bandgaps on c&#8208;Sapphire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cs2Bi3X9 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on c&#8208;sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high&#8208;quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high&#8208;oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in&#8208;plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high&#8208;oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 &#197; is achieved on c&#8208;plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 &#197; at a low temperature of 160&#160;&#176;C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30&#176; rotation of crystal orientation. First&#8208;principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs3Bi2I9 photodetector reaches up to 3.7 &#215; 1012 Jones, deriving from high single&#8208;crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low&#8208;cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Manipulation of Unconventional Spin Polarization in Non&#8208;Collinear Exchange&#8208;Spring Magnetic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel exchange&#8208;spring magnetic structure is formed by the coupling of perpendicular CoTb and in&#8208;plane Co films. When a spin current with the y&#8208;polarization flows through this exchange&#8208;spring (x&#8208;z plane) structure, the interaction between the y&#8208;spin and the local exchange field gives rise to unconventional x&#8208; and z&#8208; spin polarizations, enabling field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching.








Abstract
Manipulating the polarization of spin current is essential for understanding the mechanism of charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion and achieving efficient electrically driven magnetization switching. Here, a novel exchange&#8208;spring magnetic structure is introduced formed by the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) CoTb and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) Co films. When a spin current with the polarization along the y&#8208;direction flows through this exchange&#8208;spring (x&#8208;z plane) structure, the interaction between the y&#8208;spin and the local exchange field with a non&#8208;collinear spatial distribution gives rise to substantial unconventional spin polarizations in the x&#8208; and z&#8208;directions, enabling field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching at room temperature. More importantly, the polarization directions of this unconventional spin current can be reversed depending on whether the interfacial exchange coupling is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. This work establishes a platform to explore emergent mechanisms for manipulating unconventional spin polarization with rich non&#8208;collinear magnetic exchange spin structures.

         <title>Efficient Targeted Regulation of the Interfaces and Bulk in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells With a [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;&#8208;based Derivative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;treatment involving the incorporation of a novel solution&#8208;processable [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8208; derivative, (TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B), is proposed to simultaneously optimize the interfaces and bulk of inverted perovskite solar cells. TBA2B enhances the power conversion efficiency to 25.59% while improving the stability, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of efficient [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8208;&#8208;based interface materials and modification mechanisms.








Abstract
The performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is adversely affected by the recombination loss, ion migration, and residual stress arising from issues within the bulk and at the cathode interface. Using simple post&#8208;treatment with a novel solution&#8208;processable derivative of the dodecahydro&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborate anion ([closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;)&#8212;(TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B)&#8212;it is simultaneously address these issues. In inverted PSCs, the cationic and anionic components of TBA2B uniquely self&#8208;separate by positioning themselves precisely to perform their specific modification functions. The majority of [B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH]2&#8208; anions reside at the (6,6)&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag interface, which enhances the electrical and physical contact. Additionally, a substantial fraction of tetrabutylammonium&#160;cations diffuse into the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction, enabling comprehensive control over the trap passivation, stress release, ion migration elimination, and grain boundary reinforcement through the in situ formation of 1D TBAPbI3 on the surface of the perovskite crystals. The TBA2B devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 25.59% and open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.199&#160;V, performance that is among the highest achieved with a solution&#8208;processed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction. Furthermore, TBA2B significantly enhances the device's stability. This study provides crucial insights into the design of efficient and solution processable [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;&#8208;based interface materials, and offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying modification mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;The performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is adversely affected by the recombination loss, ion migration, and residual stress arising from issues within the bulk and at the cathode interface.

         <title>Interfacial Metal&#8208;Solvent Chelation for Direct Regeneration of LiFePO4 Cathode Black Mass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address interfacial challenges in spent LiFePO4&#160;(LFP) black mass, such as structural deterioration and residual impurities, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation strategy leveraging the strong chelation of the Acac&#8722; anion is presented. This approach enables effective spent LFP regeneration by surface reconstruction of the degraded LFP with reducing lithium diffusion barriers and enhancing lithium supplementation.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries presents a promising approach to effectively reuse valuable resources and benefit the environment. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions that commonly facilitate impurity purification and minimize structural damage, the LiFePO4 cathode black mass faces significant interfacial challenges, including structure deterioration, cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase residues, and damage from storage procedures, which hinder lithium replenishment and structure regeneration. Here, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation reaction using a lithium acetylacetonate solution is introduced to address these challenges under ambient conditions. This method regulates the near&#8208;surface structure through strong chelation between Acac&#8210; anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re&#8208;lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO4 cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.

         <title>Polymorphing Hydrogels Regulated by Photo&#8208;reactive DNA Cross&#8208;links</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA crosslinks act as a regulator in morphing of the hydrogels, adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light. Spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features of the polymorphing hydrogels within a one&#8208;pot system offer advanced solutions for applications in soft robotics and 4D printing.








Abstract
Polymorphing hydrogels can morph into another structure on demand with reprogrammable features. This concept extends the degree of morphing beyond that of traditional shape&#8208;morphing hydrogels, which predetermine their morphing capabilities at the fabrication stage. However, current polymorphing hydrogels face limitations due to the need for complex, non&#8208;sustained responsiveness or additional chemical steps for reconfigurable morphing. Here, photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymorphing hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links act as a regulator in changing the shapes of the hydrogels by adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light, which allows precise and dynamic morphing in a programmable way through a one&#8208;pot reaction. The high programmability involving spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features offers advanced solutions for multifunctional soft machines and applications requiring complex processes.

An all&#8208;inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self&#8208;powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to facilitate enhanced dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with a programmable logic gate. The encryption imaging sensing system employing PDs array achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate is capable of executing six distinct logical functions.








Abstract
As the focus on information security continues to intensify, encrypted imaging sensing technology becomes increasingly indispensable. However, the widespread application of encrypted imaging sensing technology is hindered by high manufacturing costs and complex system construction. Herein, an all&#8208;inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self&#8208;powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to enahnce dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with programmable logic gate. The PDs reach responsivity of 1.46 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 3.44 &#215; 1013 Jones, the corresponding EQE reaches 342%, which is &#8776;75.48 times greater than that without pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The outstanding performance resulting from dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect in Cs2PbI2Cl2 perovskite and Bi2TeO6/CsSn0.5Pb0.5IBr2 interface, and optimizing band arrangement from the oxidized Bi2TeO6 layer. The photovoltaic and pyro&#8208;phototronic signal of PDs can still be clearly distinguished under 8 kHz pulsed laser. More importantly, the encryption imaging sensing system achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate can execute&#160;six distinct logical functions, including &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;NOR&#8221; and &#8220;XNOR&#8221;.

         <title>Modulation in Spin State of Co3O4 Decorated Fe Single Atom Enables a Superior Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co3O4 nanoparticles are invited to anchor on Fe1&#8208;NC. It is found the spin state of Fe and Co is effectively modulated. Thereby, a boosted ORR and OER performance is achieved for Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC proved by 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB test.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon&#160;(Fe1&#8208;NC) is devised by Co3O4 (Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in eg filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH* moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 2.0&#8208; and 5.6 times higher than Fe1&#8208;NC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co3O4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352&#160;mV at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60&#160;mV by comparison with Co3O4@NC and IrO2. The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH* species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 193.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and maintains for 200&#160;h. Furthermore, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Graded Nitride Ferroelectrics Based Multi&#8208;Level Non&#8208;Volatile Memory for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composition&#8208;graded ferroelectric ScAlN multi&#8208;level memory is demonstrated, showing a storage capacity up to 7&#8208;bit, and one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced operating voltage tuning window compared to uniform composition devices. This approach paves the way for advanced integration of wurtzite ferroelectrics in multifunctional computing systems.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;level non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memories are emerging as promising candidates for data storage and neuromorphic computing applications, due to the enhancement of storage density and the reduction of energy and space consumption. Traditional multi&#8208;level operations are achieved by utilizing intermediary polarization states, which exhibit an unpredictable ferroelectric domain switching nature, leading to unstable multi&#8208;level memory. In this study, a unique approach of composition&#8208;graded ferroelectric ScAlN to achieve tunable operating voltage in a wide range and attain precise control of domain switching and stable multi&#8208;level memory is proposed. This non&#8208;volatile memory supports multi&#8208;level storage up to 7&#8208;bit capacities, and exhibits enhanced performance compared to the uniform composition device, showing one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced tuning window of operating voltage. Finally, the emulation of long&#8208;term plasticity and linear weight update akin to biological synapse with high uniformity and reliability are demonstrated. The proposed composition&#8208;grading architecture offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;level ferroelectric memories, paving the way for advanced hybrid integration in multifunctional computing systems.

         <title>Improved Efficiency and Stability in Pure&#8208;Red CdSe Nanoplatelet LEDs Enabled by Gradient Alloyed CdSeS/CdZnS Crown/Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designes a gradient crown on the side facets of CdSe nanoplatelets to address the issue of high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures. Consequently, a gradient alloyed shell is successfully grown, and the core/crown/shell nanoplatelets exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high stability. Therefore, the prepared nanoplatelets light&#8208;emitting diodes demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 30.1%.








Abstract
Anisotropic nanoplatelets (NPLs) possess strong in&#8208;plane transition dipole moments and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane emission, which enable a maximum photon out&#8208;coupling efficiency of 40% and a high gain coefficient, making them ideal candidates for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the unbalanced surface energy between the side and top facets of NPLs results in poor thermal stability and high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures, which complicates the growth of the shell. To address this issue, a gradient crown (CdSeS) around the CdSe NPLs is designed to stabilize the high energy side facets. Consequently, the gradient alloyed shell (CdZnS) is successfully grown, and the CdSe/CdSeS/CdZnS core/crown/shell NPLs exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. The CdSeS/CdZnS crown/shell structure suppressed non&#8208;radiative Auger recombinations, achieving a record&#8208;low amplification spontaneous emission threshold of 2.11 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 under femtosecond laser excitation. In addition, by selecting the carrier transport layers with matched energy levels, the NPL&#8208;LEDs demonstrate a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 30.1% in the pure&#8208;red range, driven by the 94% in&#8208;plane transition dipole moment distribution of NPL film. The NPL&#8208;LEDs also exhibited a long operational lifetime of T95 &gt; 600 h at a luminance of 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

A self&#8208;floating plasmonic sponge that harvests full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light for highly efficient water purification.








Abstract
Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure&#8208;based technology can hardly achieve 100%. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new solar converters utilizing plasmonic local heating and reasonable structure design to break the limit of solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency for freshwater production. Here, a plasmonic sponge is developed as a solar evaporation converter with excellent full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum absorption, good heat localization performance, and fast evaporation kinetics through 3D nanostructures, achieving a 131% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. Distinct from the traditional 2D localized heating&#8208;based evaporation and nonmetallic 3D water evaporation, the 3D plasmonic sponge can simultaneously achieve highly efficient local heating and super large water&#8211;air interfaces for boosting solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. The 3D plasmonic sponge can be also used as a universal converter for purifying seawater, metal ion solutions, organic pollutant solutions, and strong acid and strong alkaline solutions. The full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum absorption, high efficiency, and universality in water purification suggest that the novel 3D plasmonic solar converter can bring a significant way to alleviate the crisis of freshwater resources.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Photodetection and Photosynapse Dual&#8208;Functional Devices Based on 2D Perovskite/Organic Heterojunction for Imaging&#8208;to&#8208;Recognition Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic devices integrating visual imaging and recognition functions are achieved by employing 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunction. Through switching bias to modulate carrier and oxygen vacancy dynamics, the device exhibits photodetection property at zero bias and photosynaptic property at negative bias. This work provides a novel strategy to achieve low&#8208;power consumption, easy&#8208;switchable and functional integrated optoelectronic devices for artificial visual system.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices with imaging and recognition capabilities are crucial for developing artificial visual system (AVS). Bias&#8208;switchable photodetection and photosynaptic devices have been developed using 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunctions. This unique structure allows for modulated carrier dynamics under varied bias conditions, enabling the devices to function as photodetectors without bias and as photosynapses with bias. At zero bias, the device achieves high responsivity (&#8776;0.36 A W&#8722;1 at 320 nm) and rapid response speed (0.57 s). Under a &#8722;0.5 V bias, it exhibits persistent photoconductivity (PPC), resulting in neuromorphic synaptic behaviors with a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) index exceeding 300%. Moreover, an 8 &#215; 8 sensor array demonstrates image sensing and memory capabilities, showing in situ enhanced imaging when switching the bias from 0 to &#8722;0.5 V, and over 200 s of image memory. The image processing and recognition abilities are further explored by constructing an AVS using a 28 &#215; 28 device array combined with an artificial neural network (ANN). The adjustable synaptic weight under different reverse biases allowed for optimized simulated recognition, achieving an accuracy of 92% after 160 training epochs. This work presents a novel method for creating dual&#8208;functional photodetection and photosynaptic devices, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient AVS.

         <title>Boron Trioxide&#8208;Assisted Post&#8208;Annealing Enables Vertical Oriented Recrystallization of Sb2Se3 Thin Film for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, B2O3 coating layer is used as a flux for Sb2Se3 recrystallization, inducing a vertical orientation growth of the film while suppressing the defect of Se vacancies. The orientation control and passivation of defects enables efficient transport of carriers, resulting in the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.








Abstract
Crystallization process is critical for enhancing the crystallinity, regulating the crystal orientation of polycrystalline thin films, as well as repairing defects within the films. For quasi&#8208;1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaic materials, the preparation of Sb2Se3 thin films still faces great challenges in adjusting orientation and defect properties, which limits the device performance. In this study, a novel post&#8208;treatment strategy is developed that uses a low melting point B2O3 coating layer as a flux to drive the recrystallization of Sb2Se3, thereby regulating the micro&#8208;orientation of thermal evaporation&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 films and optimizing their electrical properties. Mechanistic investigations show that B2O3 exhibits stronger adsorption with (hk1) planes of Sb2Se3 to induce a vertical orientation growth of the film, while blocking the volatilization channels of Se and inhibiting Se vacancy defects by interacting with Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3 film with [hk1] preferential orientation and suppressed deep&#8208;level defects promotes the effective transport of charge carriers in solar cells. As a result, the B2O3&#8208;treated device delivers a champion efficiency of 9.37% without MgF2 anti&#8208;reflection coating, which is currently the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells achieved by thermal evaporation method. This study provides a new method and mechanism for regulating optical and electrical properties of low&#8208;dimensional inorganic thin films.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Regeneration of Spent LiMn2O4 Cathode Into High&#8208;Performance Ni&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient laser&#8208;assisted regeneration process is developed to convert spent LiMn2O4 cathodes into performance&#8208;enhanced, Ni&#8208;doped cathodes. Surface Ni doping enhances interfacial processes and prevents capacity loss at lower temperatures by forming a new interface with a reduced charge transfer energy barrier. This innovative approach offers a sustainable solution for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.








Abstract
The rapid increase in lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) production, fueled by the rise of electric vehicles, highlights significant challenges in managing end&#8208;of&#8208;life LIBs, particularly regarding environmental impact and waste management. Traditional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, are energy&#8208;intensive and consume substantial reagents. In this study, a laser&#8208;assisted regeneration method is introduced for LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes, enabling in situ Ni doping into spent LMO cathodes (r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni) to enhance electrochemical performance. Surface Ni&#8208;doping improves interfacial processes and reduces capacity loss at lower temperatures by creating a new interface with a lower charge transfer energy barrier. The r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni cathode surpasses pristine LMO cathodes, achieving a specific capacity of 112.95&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C and retaining 95.1% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0 &#176;C. A techno&#8208;economic analysis supports the feasibility of this laser&#8208;assisted regeneration approach, offering an innovative pathway for upcycling spent cathodes and developing next&#8208;generation Mn&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Anisotropic 2D Insulator CrOCl Nanosheets for Interfacial Symmetry Breaking in Isotropic 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anisotropic 2D insulator CrOCl nanosheets are synthesized via space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth. A MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single&#8208;mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, which endows its device with polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect. This study opens new prospects for exploring CrOCl&#8208;based physics and electronics via symmetry engineering.









Abstract
Chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator, has attracted significant interest in 2D optoelectronic, ferromagnetic, and quantum devices. However, the bottom&#8211;up preparation of 2D CrOCl remains challenging, limiting its property exploration and device application. Herein, the controllable synthesis of 2D CrOCl crystals by chemical vapor deposition is demonstrated. The combination reaction of precursors together with the space&#8208;confined growth strategy, providing stable and stoichiometric growth conditions, enable a robust synthesis of high&#8208;crystallinity CrOCl nanosheets with regular rhombus&#8208;like morphology and uniform thickness. By tuning the growth temperature from 675 to 800&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of CrOCl nanosheets can be continuously modulated from 10.2 to 30.8&#160;nm, with the domain size increasing from 16.9 to 25.5&#160;&#181;m. The as&#8208;grown CrOCl nanosheets exhibit significant structural/optical anisotropy, ultrahigh insulativity, and superior air stability. Furthermore, a MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single&#8208;mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, a novel interface phenomenon that converts MoS2 from isotropy to anisotropy. Consequently, the MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure device achieves polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect, which are nonexistent in high&#8208;symmetry 2D materials. This work paves the way for the future exploration of CrOCl&#8208;based 2D physics and devices via symmetry engineering.

         <title>A Neuronal Signal Sorting and Amplifying Nanosensor for EEG&#8208;Concordant Imaging&#8208;Guided Precision Epilepsy Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor integrates real&#8208;time, dynamically reversible potassium ion (K&#8314;) fluorescence imaging (FI) with high&#8208;resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This enables electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of hidden epileptic foci and guides minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation on mice with drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, resulting in sustained seizure control and improved cognitive outcomes.









Abstract
Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure&#8208;associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real&#8208;time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high&#8208;resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of MRI&#8208;negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

         <title>Synergistic Multimodal Energy Dissipation Enhances Certified Efficiency of Flexible Organic Photovoltaics beyond 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining multimodal energy dissipation and phase modulation in active layer films, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible electronics are innovatively co&#8208;developed to achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.07%, which is the highest PCE reported for flexible organic photovoltaic device to date.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown unparalleled application potential in the field of flexible wearable electronics in recent years due to the excellent mechanical and photovoltaic properties. However, the small molecule acceptors after polymerization in still retain some mechanical and aggregation properties of the small molecule, falling short of the ductility requirements for flexible devices. Here, based on the multimodal energy dissipation theory, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible devices are co&#8208;enhanced by adding the thermoplastic elastomer material (polyurethane, PU) to the PM6:PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based active layer films. The construction of multi&#8208;fiber network structure and the decrease of films&#8217; residual stresses contribute to the enhancement of carrier transport properties and the decrease of defect state density. Eventually, the PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 19.40% is achieved on the flexible devices with an effective area of 0.102 cm2, and the third&#8208;party certified PCE reaches 19.07%, which is the highest PCE for flexible OSCs currently available. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large&#8208;area module applications, the 25&#8208;cm2&#8208;based flexible and super&#8208;flexible modules are prepared with the PCEs of 15.48% and 14.61%, respectively, and demonstration applications are implemented.

         <title>High Efficiency (&gt;10%) AgBiS2 Colloidal Nanocrystal Solar Cells with Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymer Hole Transport Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new BD2FCT material is developed as an advanced HTL tailored for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells through precise molecular engineering. This new polymer effectively reduces charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces, thereby leading to enhanced charge extraction. Incorporation of the IEICO&#8208;4F into BD2FCT further improves charge funneling and absorption, resulting in a notable 10.1% PCE for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells.








Abstract
Silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as ecofriendly photoactive materials with excellent photoconductivity and high absorption coefficients, in compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) guidelines. To maximize the theoretical potential of AgBiS2 CNC solar cells, a new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer, BD2FCT, optimized as a hole transport layer (HTL), is developed. This asymmetric thiophene&#8208;rich polymer HTL effectively complements the optical absorption spectrum of CNCs and forms a homogeneous layer atop the CNCs, facilitating favorable vertical charge transfer through intrinsic molecular packing. Furthermore, the BD2FCT HTL aligns energetically with AgBiS2, significantly reducing charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces and enhancing charge extraction and photocurrent generation across the entire optical absorption spectrum. These characteristics are further optimized through precise molecular engineering. Additionally, a low&#8208;bandgap acceptor, IEICO&#8208;4F, is structurally incorporated with the BD2FCT polymer to further improve charge funneling and complementary absorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced hole transfer from CNC to BD2FCT&#8208;29DPP:IEICO&#8208;4F, resulting in reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Consequently, a BD2FCT&#8208;based AgBiS2 CNC solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, demonstrating significant improvements in short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

         <title>Retroreflective Multichrome Microdome Arrays Created by Single&#8208;Step Reflow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arrays of microdomes with varying radii are formed by transforming micropillars made of the positive photoresist through a single&#8208;step reflow process. These inverted microdomes exhibit radius&#8208;dependent structural colors via total internal reflection and optical interference. By controlling the density and size of the microdomes, retroreflective multicolor graphics are achieved with exceptional color representation and resolution.








Abstract
Structural colors are known for their tunability, fade resistance, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Recent advancements have shown that such colors can be efficiently produced using total internal reflection (TIR) on high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index convex microstructures without the need for periodic nanostructures. However, a reproducible, fast, and programmable production strategy for these microstructures is essential for commercial applications. Here, a single&#8208;step method is reported for creating multicolor patterns by transforming photolithographically&#8208;patterned micropillars into microdomes through thermal reflow. These micropillars, uniform in height but varying in diameter, are converted into microdomes that differ in diameter and height, which display a full spectrum of structural colors, creating a versatile color palette. This process enables the production of high&#8208;resolution multicolor graphics using a rainbow color set, with high reproducibility. Additionally, by mixing distinct microdomes and adjusting their densities, a rich variety of color presentations can be achieved, enabling the recreation of arbitrary color images with microdome arrays. The variable heights of the microdomes also allow for dynamic discoloration or color changes through mechanical compression. The high reproducibility and scalability of this method hold significant commercial promise for various optical applications.

The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction endow obtained artificial muscle with high output actuation and robust mechanical properties, exceeding typical natural muscles, which pave&#160;the way for advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles represent a role model in soft robotics featuring agile locomotion and incredible mechanical robustness. However, existing actuators lack an optimal combination of actuation parameters (including actuation modes, work capacity, mechanical strength, and damage repair) to rival biological tissues. Here, a biomimetic structural design strategy via multilevel relaxations (&#945;/&#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation) modulation is proposed for mechanical robust and healable actuator materials with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction mimic the relative slippage of actin filaments and myosin in muscles, ensuring bistable actuation through rapid thermal &#945;&#8208;relaxation and expansion. Furthermore, kinetically active secondary &#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation at reconfigurable interfaces can conquer the limited self&#8208;healing ability of fixed&#8208;orientation polymeric chains. The obtained artificial muscle exhibits high output actuation, robust mechanical properties (tensile strength of 33.5&#160;MPa), and desired functional, mechanical self&#8208;healing efficiency (89.7%), exceeding typical natural muscles in living systems. The bionic micro&#8208;nano design strategy achieves bottom&#8208;up cooperative relaxation modulation to integrate all&#8208;round performance of natural muscles, which paves the way for substantial advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Mobility and On&#8211;Off Ratio in Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mild CF4 plasma is introduced to resolve the trade&#8208;off between mobility and the on&#8208;current (Ion)/off&#8208;current (Ioff) ratio &#160;in degenerate oxide semiconductors without the need for thermal annealing. This technique effectively reduces carrier density, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio (10&#8312;) while preserving high mobility (104 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1) of thick In2O3 transistors, leading to enhanced switching performance and making it ideal for three&#8208;dimensional&#160;integration in advanced electronic devices.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics due to their high electron mobility and excellent optical properties. However, In2O3, a key material in this family, encounters significant challenges in balancing high mobility and effective switching as its thickness is scaled down to nanometer dimensions. The high electron density in ultra&#8208;thin In2O3 hinders its ability to turn off effectively, leading to a critical trade&#8208;off between mobility and the on&#8208;current (Ion)/off&#8208;current (Ioff) ratio. This study introduces a mild CF4 plasma doping technique that effectively reduces electron density in 10&#160;nm In2O3 at a low processing temperature of 70&#160;&#176;C, achieving a high mobility of 104 cm2 V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 10&#8312;. A subsequent low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;annealing further improves the critical reliability and stability of CF4&#8208;doped In2O3 without raising the thermal budget, making this technique suitable for monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (3D) integration. Additionally, its application is demonstrated in In2O3 depletion&#8208;load inverters, highlighting its potential for advanced logic circuits and broader electronic and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Structural MXene/PBO Aerogels for High&#8208;Performance Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ultra&#8208;Low Reflection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of in situ growth method, heterostructure MXene@Ni electromagnetic functional fillers with good impedance matching performance are prepared by &#8220;electrostatic adsorption&#8208;solvothermal reduction&#8221;. And the obtained asymmetric structural (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8208;(MXene/PNF) aerogels prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept present high&#8208;performance electromagnetic interference shielding with ultra&#8208;low reflection and infrared camouflage.








Abstract
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with low electromagnetic (EM) waves reflection characteristics are ideal materials for blocking EM radiation and pollution. Materials with low reflectivity must be constructed using materials with excellent EM waves absorption properties. However, materials simultaneously possessing both low reflectivity and excellent EMI shielding performance remain scarce, consequently, multilayer structures need to be developed. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8211;2,6&#8211;benzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PNF) are prepared by deprotonation. PNF are combined with MXene and heterostructure MXene@Ni prepared by in&#8208;situ growth; MXene@Ni/PNF acts as an EM absorption layer while MXene/PNF acts as an EM reflective layer. Finally, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels are prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept. Experimental characterizations revealed that (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels enable the efficient absorption&#8208;reflection&#8208;reabsorption of EM waves, effectively eliminating EMI. When the mass ratio of MXene to Ni in MXene@Ni is 1:6 and the mass fraction of MXene in the reflective layer is 80 wt.%, the (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels exhibit excellent EMI shielding performance (71 dB) and a very low reflection coefficient (R = 0.10). Finite element simulations verified that the developed asymmetric structural aerogels achieve high EMI shielding performance with low reflection characteristics. In addition, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels display excellent infrared camouflage ability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Induced Energetic Coordination Compounds as Additives for Laser Initiation Primary Explosives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) are first used as additives to lead azide (LA) to design laser ignition primary explosives. These laser&#8208;sensitive mixed composites exhibit remarkable initiating ability, extremely low laser initiation threshold (Emin), fast response times (Tmin), and acceptable stabilities. The strategy can broaden new application scenarios and unveil new perspectives for coordination compounds as additives in advanced laser pyrotechnics for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Laser ignition of primary explosives presents more reliable alternative to traditional electrical initiation methods. However, the commercial initiator lead azide (LA) requires a high&#8208;power density laser to detonate, with the minimum laser initiation energy (Emin) of 2402 mJ. Currently, the laser&#8208;ignitable metal complex&#8208;based igniters still suffer from weak detonation capabilities and high Emin values. Here, the approach is first proposed to design laser ignition primary explosives within the high energy azide and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic coordination compounds (ECCs), [Co(N3)(2&#8208;bmttz)(H2O)]2 1 and [Co(N3)(2&#8208;bmttz)(MeOH)]2 2 as additives to LA. Material 1e with 4&#160;wt.% of 1 in LA, exhibits ultra&#8208;low laser initiation threshold (Emin = 1.6 mJ) and ultrafast corresponding time (Tmin = 0.2&#160;ms). Specially, compared to LA, the threshold of 1e is as low as 1/1500 of that of LA. Moreover, 30&#160;mg 1e successfully detonates RDX with a laser energy of 1.6 mJ. Theoretical calculations and experiment results reveal that 1 exhibits the superior additive effect compared to 2, attributed to its more enhanced ability to generate free radicals and higher photothermal conversion efficiency under laser conditions. This work represents a paradigm shift, with the potential to develop a laser&#8208;driven micro&#8208;detonator combining powerful detonation capabilities with exceptionally low laser initiation energy.

         <title>Hollow Mo/MoSVn Nanoreactors with Tunable Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) in the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors can be gradiently modulated via tailoring the sulfur vacancies, and exhibit parabola&#8208;shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities. Moderate BIEF evidently facilitates the hydrogen desorption in the HER and the breakage of N&#9472;H bond in the UOR, endowing the Mo/MoSV1 electrolyzer with superior activity and durability.








Abstract
Constructing built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) in heterojunction catalyst is an effective way to optimize adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, while its precise tailor to achieve efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis remains great challenge. Herein, the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors with tunable BIEFs are elaborately prepared to simultaneously promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for sustainable hydrogen production. The BIEF induced by sulfur vacancies can be modulated from 0.79 to 0.57 to 0.42&#160;mV nm&#8722;1, and exhibits a parabola&#8208;shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities, the Mo/MoSV1 nanoreactor with moderate BIEF presents the best bifunctional activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the moderate BIEF can evidently facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the HER and the breakage of N&#9472;H bond in the UOR. The electrolyzer assembled with Mo/MoSV1 delivers a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which is 437&#160;mV lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, and also presents excellent durability at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 200&#160;h. Life cycle assessment indicates the HER||UOR system possesses notable superiority across various environment impact and energy consumption. This work can provide theoretical and experimental direction on the rational design of advanced materials for energy&#8208;saving and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen production.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for New Generation Flexible Multicolor Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are introduced as a novel class of multicolor electrochromic materials with significant potential for the next&#8208;generation flexible electrochromic devices (FMEDs). This perspective provides new insights into the coloring mechanisms and presents strategies for optimizing device performance, highlighting potential multidisciplinary applications in camera lenses, camouflage, displays, and wearable electronics.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto&#8208;electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c&#8208;MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c&#8208;MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c&#8208;MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re&#8208;visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration to the eventual industrial&#8208;scale implementation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.
