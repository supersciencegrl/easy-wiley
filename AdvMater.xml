         <title>Engineered Extracellular Matrices with Integrated Wireless Microactuators to Study Mechanobiology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in vitro biomimetic platform that provides independent control over geometry, mechanics, and structure over extracellular matrices is introduced. Remote application of forces using robotically controlled magnetic microactuators triggers native mechanobiology responses including intracellular signaling and directed migration. A digital twin complements the platform by reporting stresses generated upon actuation.








Abstract
Mechanobiology explores how forces regulate cell behaviors and what molecular machinery are responsible for the sensing, transduction, and modulation of mechanical cues. To this end, probing of cells cultured on planar substrates has served as a primary experimental setting for many decades. However, native extracellular matrices (ECMs) consist of fibrous protein assemblies where the physical properties spanning from the individual fiber to the network architecture can influence the transmission of forces to and from the cells. Here, a robotic manipulation platform that allows wireless, localized, and programmable deformation of an engineered fibrous ECM is introduced. A finite&#8208;element&#8208;based digital twin of the fiber network calibrated against measured local and global parameters enables the calculation of deformations and stresses generated by different magnetic actuation schemes across a range of network properties. Physiologically relevant mechanical forces are applied to cells cultured on the fiber network, statically or dynamically, revealing insights into the effects of matrix&#8208;borne forces and deformations as well as force&#8208;mediated matrix remodeling on cell migration and intracellular signaling. These capabilities are not matched by any existing approach, and this versatile platform has the potential to uncover fundamental mechanisms of mechanobiology in settings with greater relevance to living tissues.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Holographic Display and Encryption with Full&#8208;Polarization Degree of Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A minimalist metasurface assembling geometric phase meta&#8208;atoms in a tetratomic macro pixel is proposed, which enables the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization (orientation, ellipticity, and chirality) and color (real hue, saturation, and brightness) spaces simultaneously. The proposed strategy has great potential in multiplex&#8208;oriented applications, such as holographic data storage and information transfer.








Abstract
Metasurfaces provide a compact and powerful platform for manipulating the fundamental properties of light, and have shown unprecedented capabilities in both optical holographic display and information encryption. For increasing information display/storage capacity, metasurfaces with more polarization manipulation channel and full&#8208;color holographic functionality are now an urgent requirement. Here, a minimalist dielectric metasurface with the capability of full&#8208;color holography encoded with arbitrary polarization is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. Without the daunting exploratory and computational problem in nanostructure searching, full&#8208;color holographic images can be multiplexed into arbitrary polarization channels through vectorial ptychography and k&#8208;space ptychography based on tetratomic macropixel geometric phase metasurfaces. Thanks to the full degree of freedom tuning in polarization and color spaces, the application scenarios such as holographic 3D imaging and information encryption are realized. The strategy exhibits promising potential in applications of 3Dl display, augmented/virtual reality, high&#8208;density data storage, and encryption.

         <title>A Zwitterionic Polyurethane Nanoporous Device with Low Foreign&#8208;Body Response for Islet Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterionic nanofibrous islet encapsulation device made of sulfobetaine&#8208;modified polyurethane is reported. The device is mechanically robust, effective in preventing cell entrance or escape, hydrophilic with facile mass transfer, and biocompatible with low levels of fibrotic deposition in mice, dogs, and pigs. These attributes make it an attractive candidate for safe delivery of insulin&#8208;producing cells to treat type 1 diabetes.








Abstract
Encapsulation of insulin&#8208;producing cells is a promising strategy for treatment of type 1 diabetes. However, engineering an encapsulation device that is both safe (i.e., no cell escape and no breakage) and functional (i.e., low foreign&#8208;body response (FBR) and high mass transfer) remains a challenge. Here, a family of zwitterionic polyurethanes (ZPU) with sulfobetaine groups in the polymer backbone is developed, which are fabricated into encapsulation devices with tunable nanoporous structures via electrospinning. The ZPU encapsulation device is hydrophilic and fouling&#8208;resistant, exhibits robust mechanical properties, and prevents cell escape while still allowing efficient mass transfer. The ZPU device also induces a much lower FBR or cellular overgrowth upon intraperitoneal implantation in C57BL/6 mice for up to 6 months compared to devices made of similar polyurethane without the zwitterionic modification. The therapeutic potential of the ZPU device is shown for islet encapsulation and diabetes correction in mice for &#8776;3 months is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, the scalability and retrievability of the ZPU device in pigs and dogs are further demonstrated. Collectively, these attributes make ZPU devices attractive candidates for cell encapsulation therapies.

         <title>Dynamic Symmetry Breaking in Chiral Magnetic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel domain growth behaviors are observed with respect to in&#8208;plane magnetic fields in [Co/Ni/Pt] multilayers with chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs), including growth perpendicular to the in&#8208;plane field axis. Accounting for steady&#8208;state DW dynamics, the authors&#8217; model successfully predicts the magnetization and energetic profiles that promote these asymmetries. These results expand the utility of DW motion in probing chiral magnetism.








Abstract
The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) in magnetic systems stabilizes spin textures with preferred chirality, applicable to next&#8208;generation memory and computing architectures. In perpendicularly magnetized heavy&#8208;metal/ferromagnet films, the interfacial DMI originating from structural inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling favors chiral N&#233;el&#8208;type domain walls (DWs) whose energetics and mobility remain at issue. Here, a new effect is characterized in which domains expand unidirectionally in response to a combination of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane magnetic fields, with the growth direction controlled by the in&#8208;plane field strength. These growth directionalities and symmetries with applied fields cannot be understood from static treatments alone. The authors theoretically demonstrate that perpendicular field torques stabilize steady&#8208;state magnetization profiles highly asymmetric in elastic energy, resulting in a dynamic symmetry breaking consistent with the experimental findings. This phenomenon sheds light on the mechanisms governing the dynamics of N&#233;el&#8208;type DWs and expands the utility of field&#8208;driven DW motion to probe and control chiral DWs.

         <title>Micropatterns Fabricated by Photodimerization&#8208;Induced Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward yet powerful strategy to fabricate micropatterns on film surfaces is developed by spatially regulating the photodimerization and mass transport of maleimide. This technology integrates the characteristics of top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up methods, providing a versatile basis for applications in microfluidic channels, composite gratings, devices, and functional systems.








Abstract
Pattern technology plays an important role in the generation of microstructures with different functionalities and morphologies. In this report, a straightforward and versatile strategy is presented for spatially regulating the growth of a microstructure on a surface by the photodimerization of maleimide (MI). Upon exposure of ultraviolet (UV) light, photodimerization of MI in a film comprising furan&#8208;grafted polymer and bismaleimide (BMI) produces a chemical gradient, which can drive the diffusion of BMI from the unexposed to the exposed region and from the bottom to the surface, resulting in the growth of micropatterns. Sequential crosslinking induced by the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction between MI and furan maintains the stability of pattern shape. Theoretical modeling with reaction&#8208;diffusion equations reveal that as photodimerization moves the system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the formation of a chemical potential gradient requires the redistribution of matter, resulting in the formation of topographies. Directional molecular motion induced by UV light can generate complex morphology, and produce materials with unique optical functions, such as charming&#8208;ordered gratings. This straightforward method of fabricating micropatterns by photodimerization&#8208;induced diffusion is successfully applied to patterned curved surfaces, microfluidic channels and encapsulation of integrated light emitting diode chips.

         <title>Metavalent Bonding in Crystalline Solids: How Does It Collapse?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metavalent bonding in solids is shown to differ significantly from covalent bonding, as demonstrated by pronounced property changes for optical, vibrational, electronic, and structural properties upon the transition from covalent to metavalent bonding. This insight and the resulting map showing trends in chemical bonding and material properties can be used to design and tailor materials.








Abstract
The chemical bond is one of the most powerful, yet much debated concepts in chemistry, explaining property trends in solids. Recently, a novel type of chemical bonding was&#160;identified in several higher chalcogenides, characterized by a unique property portfolio, unconventional bond breaking, and sharing of about one electron between adjacent atoms. This metavalent bond is a fundamental type of bonding in solids, besides covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, raising the pertinent question as to whether there is a well&#8208;defined transition between metavalent and covalent bonds. Here, three different pseudo&#8208;binary lines, namely, GeTe1&#8722;xSex, Sb2Te3(1&#8722;x)Se3x, and Bi2&#8722;2xSb2xSe3, are studied, and a sudden change in several properties, including optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, Born effective charge Z*, electrical conductivity, as well as bond breaking behavior for a critical Se or Sb concentration, is evidenced. These findings provide a blueprint to experimentally explore the influence of metavalent bonding on attractive properties of phase&#8208;change materials and thermoelectrics. Particularly important is its impact on optical properties, which can be tailored by the amount of electrons shared between adjacent atoms. This correlation can be used to design optoelectronic materials and to explore systematic changes in chemical bonding with stoichiometry and atomic arrangement.

         <title>A Sustainable and Flexible Microbrush&#8208;Faced Triboelectric Generator for Portable/Wearable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microbrush&#8208;faced triboelectric nanogenerator featuring high robustness, outstanding sustainability, and excellent durability displays remarkable capability for mechanical energy harvesting in separate working modes. Human&#8208;being&#8208;interactive triboelectrification with this device reveals outstanding power generation and durability, suggesting that it can serve as a power source for various types of handheld electronics.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are put forward as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy&#8208;scavenging technology for self&#8208;powered electronics, but their severe wear and degradation driven by inevitable friction can pose significant durability and sustainability concerns. Here, an array of microfibers is reported that functions as a robust and sustainable TENG in both in&#8208;plane sliding and vertical contact&#8208;separation modes, with excellent electrical potential as high as 20&#160;V and a high cyclability of 3000. The design flexibility of this microbrush TENG (MB&#8208;TENG) on the counter materials facilitates the further improvement of electrical outputs, benefiting numerous applications of human&#8208;interactive triboelectrification. Significantly, these MB&#8208;TENGs offer sufficient output power for successfully driving a smartwatch as well as an electromyography module. This technology uses a simple and cost&#8208;effective manner to provide a robust and reliable monolithic TENG module, which is expected to serve as a promising energy&#8208;harvesting source for self&#8208;powered electronics in the near future.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Tumor&#8208;Penetrating and Oligomeric Nanozyme Based on Intrinsically Self&#8208;Assembling Protein Nanocages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It remains challenging to precisely control and reproducibly formulate nanomedicines. A nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy is established for tailoring oligomeric nanostructures and a series of artificial metalloenzymes in a precisely controlled manner, which offers an option for tailored anticancer nanomedicines that have a high degree of control over both geometry and valency.








Abstract
Biomimetic design of nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics has emerged as a promising method for the generation of novel therapeutics. However, synthesis of nanomaterials while maintaining a high degree of control over both geometry and valency poses a prominent challenge. Herein, the authors introduce a nanomaterial&#8208;based synthetic biology strategy for accurate and quantitative tailoring of high&#8208;ordered nanostructures that uses a &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; hierarchical incorporation of protein building blocks. The assembled nano&#8208;oligomers possessed tunable protein motifs and multivalent binding domains, which facilitated prolonged blood circulation time, accumulation within tumor cells through direct targeting of cell receptors, and deep tumor tissue penetration via a transcytosis mechanism. Using these protein/protein nano&#8208;oligomers as scaffolds, the authors created a new series of artificial nano&#8208;scaled metalloenzymes (nanozymes) by the in situ incorporation of metal nanoclusters within the cavity of the protein nanocages. Nanozymes were&#160;capable of mimicking peroxidase&#8208;like activity and generated cytotoxic free radicals. Compared to nanozyme alone, the systemic delivery of oligomeric nanozymes demonstrated significantly enhanced therapeutic and anti&#8208;tumor benefits. This study shows a new insight into nanotechnology by taking advantage of synthetic biotechnology.

         <title>Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ordered Laminate Borides and Their 2D Ti&#8208;Based Derivative from Chemical Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemical order in the layered T2 phase Ti4MoSiB2 (o&#8208;MAB) is theoretically predicted and experimentally verified. Chemical exfoliation of the compound is shown by derivation of a 2D material, TiOxCly. The 2D sheets have a direct band gap of &#8776;4.1&#160;eV and display characteristics suitable for supercapacitor applications.








Abstract
Exploratory theoretical predictions in uncharted structural and compositional space are integral to materials discoveries. Inspired by M5SiB2 (T2) phases, the finding of a family of laminated quaternary metal borides, M&#8242;4M&#8243;SiB2, with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemical order is reported here. 11 chemically ordered phases as well as 40 solid solutions, introducing four elements previously not observed in these borides are predicted. The predictions are experimentally verified for Ti4MoSiB2, establishing Ti as part of the T2 boride compositional space. Chemical exfoliation of Ti4MoSiB2 and select removal of Si and MoB2 sub&#8208;layers is validated by derivation of a 2D material, TiOxCly, of high yield and in the form of delaminated sheets. These sheets have an experimentally determined direct band gap of &#8776;4.1&#160;eV, and display characteristics suitable for supercapacitor applications. The results take the concept of chemical exfoliation beyond currently available 2D materials, and expands the envelope of 3D and 2D candidates, and their applications.

         <title>Hydrophilicity&#8208;Hydrophobicity Transformation, Thermoresponsive Morphomechanics, and Crack Multifurcation Revealed by AIEgens in Mechanically Strong Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation has been achieved in a facile, high&#8208;contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation&#8208;induced emission as fluorescent indicators.

Biomimetic exploration of stimuli&#8208;responsive and crack&#8208;resistant hydrogels is of great academic and practical significance, although the rational design of tough hydrogels is limited by insufficient mechanism study due to the lack of imaging techniques to &#8220;see&#8221; hydrogels at mesoscale level. A series of composite hydrogels with compartmentalized thermal response is designed by incorporating aggregation&#8208; and polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorescent probes in a poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) network grafted with poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) side&#8208;chains. The fluorescence technique is explored as a powerful tool to directly visualize their hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity transformation and the composition&#8208;dependent microphase separation. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical measurements, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed. In this regard, the thermoresponsive toughening is attributed to the formation of multiple noncovalent interactions and the conformational changes of PNIPAM chains. The enhanced fracture energy by crack multifurcation is related to the tearing&#8208;like disruption of weak interfaces between the separated phases.

&lt;p&gt;The direct visualization of microphase separation and easy differentiation of hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity transformation has been achieved in a facile, high-contrast, and noninvasive manner by using luminogens with aggregation-induced emission as fluorescent indicators. Based on the morphological observation and mechanical study, the concept of morphomechanics with a comprehensive mechanism clarification is proposed.

         <title>Rational Design of a High Performance and Robust Solar Evaporator via 3D&#8208;Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed solar evaporator using the double layered photoabsorber on a concave shaped 3D&#8208;printed supporter improves the light harvesting capacity by reutilizing reflected light and prevents the salt deposition due to hydrophobic upper layer of the photoabsorber, meanwhile the hydrophilic bottom layer continuously pumps the water. As a result, the rationally designed solar evaporator exhibits an outstanding evaporation performance.








Abstract
Utilizing the broad&#8208;band solar spectrum for sea water desalination is a promising method that can provide fresh water without sophisticated infrastructures. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapour efficiency has been limited due to the lack of a proper design for the evaporator to deal with either a large amount of heat loss or salt accumulation. Here, these issues are addressed via two cost&#8208;effective approaches: I) a rational design of a concave shaped supporter by 3D&#8208;printing that can promote the light harvesting capacity via multiple reflections on the surface; II) the use of a double layered photoabsorber composed of a hydrophilic bottom layer of a polydopamine (PDA) coated glass fiber (GF/C) and a hydrophobic upper layer of a carbonized poly(vinyl alcohol)/polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVA/PVP) hydrogel on the supporter, which provides competitive benefit for preventing deposition of salt while quickly pumping the water. The 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator can efficiently utilize solar energy (99%) with an evaporation rate of 1.60 kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and efficiency of 89% under 1 sun irradiation. The underlying reason for the high efficiency obtained is supported by the heat transfer mechanism. The 3D&#8208;printed solar evaporator could provide cheap drinking water in remote areas, while maintaining stable performance for a long term.

         <title>Marked Passivation Effect of Naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;Dicarboximides in High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyaromatic passivator 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl substituted naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide provides chemical passivation (protonic/Lewis&#8208;base groups system) and energetic passivation (creating benign midgap states) effects. The Lewis&#8208;base/polyaromatic conjugation/protonic system reduces defects efficiently and avoids superoxide anions in perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
As game&#8208;changers in the photovoltaic community, perovskite solar cells are making unprecedented progress while still facing grand challenges such as improving lifetime without impairing efficiency. Herein, two structurally alike polyaromatic molecules based on naphthalene&#8208;1,8&#8208;dicarboximide (NMI) and perylene&#8208;3,4&#8208;dicarboximide (PMI) with different molecular dipoles are applied to tackle this issue. Contrasting the electronically pull&#8211;pull cyanide&#8208;substituted PMI (9CN&#8208;PMI) with only Lewis&#8208;base groups, the push&#8211;pull 4&#8208;hydroxybiphenyl&#8208;substituted NMI (4OH&#8208;NMI) with both protonic and Lewis&#8208;base groups can provide better chemical passivation for both shallow&#8208; and deep&#8208;level defects. Moreover, combined theoretical and experimental studies show that the 4OH&#8208;NMI can bind more firmly with perovskite and the polyaromatic backbones create benign midgap states in the excited perovskite to suppress the damage by superoxide anions (energetic passivation). The polar and protonic nature of 4OH&#8208;NMI facilitates band alignment and regulates the viscosity of the precursor solution for thicker perovskite films with better morphology. Consequently, the 4OH&#8208;NMI&#8208;passivated perovskite films exhibit reduced grain boundaries and nearly three&#8208;times lower defect density, boosting the device efficiency to 23.7%. A more effective design of the passivator for perovskites with multi&#8208;passivation mechanisms is provided in this study.

         <title>In Situ Tumor Vaccination with Nanoparticle Co&#8208;Delivering CpG and STAT3 siRNA to Effectively Induce Whole&#8208;Body Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors (AIRISE&#8208;02) is a nano&#8208;immunotherapeutic candidate that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA to a local tumor, generating anti&#8208;tumor immune response against cancer everywhere in the body (both treated and untreated tumors). Combination of AIRISE&#8208;02 and standard immune checkpoint inhibitors cures 63% of mice with melanoma tumors, while the inhibitors alone cure none.








Abstract
The success of immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a subset of individuals has been very exciting. However, in many cancers, responses to current ICIs are modest and are seen only in a small subsets of patients. Herein, a widely applicable approach that increases the benefit of ICIs is reported. Intratumoral administration of augmenting immune response and inhibiting suppressive environment of tumors&#8212;AIRISE&#8208;02 nanotherapeutic that co&#8208;delivers CpG and STAT3 siRNA&#8212;results in not only regression of the injected tumor, but also tumors at distant sites in multiple tumor model systems. In particular, three doses of AIRISE&#8208;02 in combination with systemic ICIs completely cure both treated and untreated aggressive melanoma tumors in 63% of mice, while ICIs alone do not cure any mice. A long&#8208;term memory immune effect is also reported. AIRISE&#8208;02 is effective in breast and colon tumor models as well. Lastly, AIRISE&#8208;02 is well tolerated in mice and nonhuman primates. This approach combines multiple therapeutic agents into a single nanoconstruct to create whole&#8208;body immune responses across multiple cancer types. Being a local therapeutic, AIRISE&#8208;02 circumvents regulatory challenges of systemic nanoparticle delivery, facilitating rapid translation to the clinic. AIRISE&#8208;02 is under investigational new drug (IND)&#8208;enabling studies, and clinical trials will soon follow.

         <title>Manipulating Ferromagnetism in Few&#8208;Layered Cr2Ge2Te6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ionic conductors as the gate dielectric, the easy&#8208;axis of the ferromagnetism of Cr2Ge2Te6 thin flakes can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to the in&#8208;plane direction by an electric field, coinciding with a significant increase of the Curie temperature. The surface of the sample is fully exposed in this type of devices, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible.








Abstract
The discovery of magnetism in 2D materials offers new opportunities for exploring novel quantum states and developing spintronic devices. In this work, using field&#8208;effect transistors with solid ion conductors as the gate dielectric (SIC&#8208;FETs), we&#160;have observed a significant enhancement of ferromagnetism associated with magnetic easy&#8208;axis switching in few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. The easy axis of the magnetization, inferred from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, can be uniformly tuned from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction to an in&#8208;plane direction by electric field in the few&#8208;layered Cr2Ge2Te6. Additionally, the Curie temperature, obtained from both the Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, increases from 65 to 180 K in the few&#8208;layered sample by electric gating. Moreover, the surface of the sample is fully exposed in the SIC&#8208;FET device configuration, making further heterostructure&#8208;engineering possible. This work offers an excellent platform for realizing electrically controlled quantum phenomena in a single device.

In this work, using field-effect transistors with solid ion conductors as the gate dielectric (SIC-FETs), we&#160;have observed a significant enhancement of ferromagnetism associated with magnetic easy-axis switching in few-layered Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The easy axis of the magnetization, inferred from the anisotropic magnetoresistance, can be uniformly tuned from the out-of-plane direction to an in-plane direction by electric field in the few-layered Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the Curie temperature, obtained from both the Hall resistance and magnetoresistance measurements, increases from 65 to 180 K in the few-layered sample by electric gating. Moreover, the surface of the sample is fully exposed in the SIC-FET device configuration, making further heterostructure-engineering possible. This work offers an excellent platform for realizing electrically controlled quantum phenomena in a single device.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide alloys containing 4 or 5 transition metals are synthesized based on first&#8208;principles stability predictions. The 5&#8208;component alloy (MoWVNbTa)S2 is shown to be an excellent electrocatalyst for the conversion of CO2 into CO. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest that a small concentration of highly active sites is responsible for the high activity.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys combine multiple principal elements at a near equal fraction to form vast compositional spaces to achieve outstanding functionalities that are absent in alloys with one or two principal elements. Here, the prediction, synthesis, and multiscale characterization of 2D high&#8208;entropy transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) alloys with four/five transition metals is reported. Of these, the electrochemical performance of a five&#8208;component alloy with the highest configurational entropy, (MoWVNbTa)S2, is investigated for CO2 conversion to CO, revealing an excellent current density of 0.51 A cm&#8722;2 and a turnover frequency of 58.3 s&#8722;1 at &#8776; &#8722;0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. First&#8208;principles calculations show that the superior CO2 electroreduction is due to a multi&#8208;site catalysis wherein the atomic&#8208;scale disorder optimizes the rate&#8208;limiting step of CO desorption by facilitating isolated transition metal edge sites with weak CO binding. 2D high&#8208;entropy TMDC alloys provide a materials platform to design superior catalysts for many electrochemical systems.

         <title>Powering Electronic Devices from Salt Gradients in AA&#8208;Battery&#8208;Sized Stacks of Hydrogel&#8208;Infused Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The most powerful electric fish, the Atlantic torpedo ray, uses sheet&#8208;like electrically active cells within its electric organs to produce external electrical discharges of up to 1&#160;kW. A paper&#8208;based artificial electric organ is presented, which mimics the torpedo strategies for optimal power generation, resulting in a small and potentially biocompatible energy&#8208;storage device capable of operating real&#8208;world electronics.








Abstract
Strongly electric fish use gradients of ions within their bodies to generate stunning external electrical discharges; the most powerful of these organisms, the Atlantic torpedo ray, can produce pulses of over 1&#160;kW from its electric organs. Despite extensive study of this phenomenon in nature, the development of artificial power generation schemes based on ion gradients for portable, wearable, or implantable human use has remained out of reach. Previously, an artificial electric organ inspired by the electric eel demonstrated that electricity generated from ion gradients within stacked hydrogels can exceed 100&#160;V. The current of this power source, however, was&#160;too low to power standard electronics. Here, an artificial electric organ inspired by the unique morphologies of torpedo rays for maximal current output is introduced. This power source uses a hybrid material of hydrogel&#8208;infused paper to create, organize, and reconfigure stacks of thin, arbitrarily large gel films in series and in parallel. The resulting increase in electrical power by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the original eel&#8208;inspired design makes it possible to power electronic devices and establishes that biology's mechanism of generating significant electrical power can now be realized from benign and soft materials in a portable size.

         <title>Construction of Supercapacitor&#8208;Based Ionic Diodes with Adjustable Bias Directions by Using Poly(ionic liquid) Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulation strategy to design bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable supercapacitor&#8208;diodes is demonstrated. Such multifunctional devices show excellent charge&#8208;storage performance and rectification performance, which fills a gap in the current capacitive ionic diodes.








Abstract
The newly emerging supercapacitor&#8208;diode (CAPode), integrating the characteristics of a diode into an electrical&#8208;double&#8208;layer capacitor, can be employed to extend conventional supercapacitors to new technological applications and may play a crucial role in grid stabilization, signal propagation, and logic operations. However, the reported CAPodes have only been able to realize charge storage in the positive&#8208;bias direction. Here, bias&#8208;direction&#8208;adjustable CAPodes realized by using a polycation&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) or a polyanion&#8208;based IL as electrolyte in an asymmetric carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor architecture are proposed. The resulting CAPodes exhibit charge&#8208;storage function at only the positive&#8208; or negative&#8208;bias direction with a high rectification ratio (&#8776;80% for rectification ratio II, RRII) and an outstanding cycling life (4500 cycles), representing a crucial breakthrough for designing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Transparent Omni&#8208;Directional Stretchable Circuit Lines Made by a Junction&#8208;Free Grid of Expandable Au Lines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to fabricate omni&#8208;directional stretchable gold (Au) circuit lines with high transparency, high electrical conductivity, and negligible resistance change is presented. Metals are deposited directly over the crack&#8208;controlled poly(dimethylsiloxane) surface forming grid inside the cracks. This study demonstrates a highly transparent, stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode with a patterned Au line circuit board.








Abstract
Although various stretchable optoelectronic devices have been reported, omni&#8208;directionally stretchable transparent circuit lines have been a great challenge. Cracks are engineered and fabricated to be highly conductive patterned metal circuit lines in which gold (Au) grids are embedded. Au is deposited selectively in the cracks to form a grid without any junction between the grid lines. Since each grid line is expandable under stretching, the circuit lines are stretchable in all the directions. This study shows that a thin coating of aluminum on the oxide surface enables precise control of the cracks (crack density, crack depth) in the oxide layer. High optical transparency and high stretchability can be achieved simultaneously by controlling the grid density in the circuit line. Light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated directly on the circuit lines and stable operation is demonstrated under 100% stretching.

         <title>Synthesis of a Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Perovskite SmTiO2N Bifunctional Photocatalyst via an Evaporation&#8208;Assisted Layered&#8208;Precursor Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new n&#8208;type perovskite SmTiO2N photocatalyst with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV is synthesized to show functionalities of both water reduction and oxidation under visible light, whose success is ascribed to the development of an evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy that is of generality for synthesis of other oxynitrides.








Abstract
Development of visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive oxynitride photocatalysts has been highly inspired for promising solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion, but the number of Ti&#8208;based oxynitrides is scarce because of the relatively low thermal stability of Ti4+ ions under ammonia flow. Here, the feasible synthesis of a novel perovskite SmTiO2N from the layered NaSmTiO4 precursor is demonstrated to exhibit wide visible&#8208;light response with a bandgap of &#8776;2.1&#160;eV and to show effective water reduction and oxidation functionalities under visible&#8208;light irradiation. The successful preparation mainly results from the synergistic effect of the layered structure of NaSmTiO4 and the evaporation spillover of Na+ ions, both of which are favorable for ammonia diffusion to accelerate the substitution of nitrogen to oxygen atoms and to shorten the nitridation time. The thermodynamic and kinetic feasibility of SmTiO2N for water splitting are investigated in detail, and its optimal apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of water oxidation reaches 16.7% at 420&#160;&#177;&#160;10&#160;nm, higher by far than that of most previous visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive photocatalysts. Interestingly, a series of oxynitrides RTiO2N (R = La, Pr, Nd) are similarly synthesized by the alkali&#8208;metal evaporation&#8208;assisted layered&#8208;precursor strategy, demonstrating its generality to prepare visible&#8208;light&#8208;responsive (oxy)nitride photocatalysts containing reducible metals for solar energy conversion.

         <title>Emulsion&#8208;Guided Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Particles: Droplet Size Determines Particle Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controlled synthesis of a series of novel anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) using an emulsion&#8208;templating method is described. The geometry of the APPs is determined by the average size of the oil droplets, based on a new mechanism. The APPs can be converted to anisotropic carbon particles with their architectures, which can be used as electrocatalysts in oxygen reduction reactions.








Abstract
Anisotropic particles have attracted significant attention due to their alluring features that distinguish them from isotropic particles. One of the most appealing strategies for the synthesis of anisotropic particles is the emulsion&#8208;guided method. However, morphological control and the understanding of formation mechanisms have remained a major challenge. Based on a novel mechanism, here, a facile one&#8208;pot emulsion&#8208;templating method for the tunable construction of anisotropic polymeric particles (APPs) with different defined structures is reported. Three types of monocomponent APPs with new morphologies and sizes in the range of 240&#8211;650&#160;nm, including Janus mushroom&#8208;like mesoporous poly(m&#8208;phenylenediamine) (PmPD) particles, wheel&#8208;shaped particles, and acorn&#8208;like PmPD particles, are obtained by controlling the average size of the oil droplets in the emulsion. Furthermore, the APPs demonstrate the ability for conversion to nitrogen&#8208;doped anisotropic carbon particles (ACPs) by pyrolysis at 800&#160;&#176;C under a N2 atmosphere, thereby inheriting their structures. These novel ACPs show appreciable potential as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for use in oxygen reduction reactions. Compared to their isotropic counterpart, these ACPs exhibit remarkable advantages such as enhanced specific surface area and pore volume, reduced stacking density, and easy fabrication of continuous and uniform membrane electrodes.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Spectrum Porphyrin&#8211;Fullerene D&#8211;A Supramolecular Photocatalyst with Giant Built&#8208;In Electric Field for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;spectrum responsive donor&#8211;acceptor supramolecular photocatalyst TPPS/C60 is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%. The TPPS/C60 performs with a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure and the giant internal electric field dramatically promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A full&#8208;spectrum (300&#8211;850&#160;nm) responsive donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) supramolecular photocatalyst tetraphenylporphinesulfonate/fullerene (TPPS/C60) is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%, offering the possibility of full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. The TPPS/C60 performs a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 276.55&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure effectively promotes electron transfer from TPPS to C60, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction. Specifically, a giant internal electric field in the D&#8211;A structure is built via the enhanced molecular dipole, which dramatically promotes the charge separation (CS) efficiency by 2.35 times. Transient absorption spectra results show a long&#8208;lived CS state TPPS&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8722; in the D&#8211;A structure, which effectively promotes participation of photogenerated electrons in the reduction reaction. Briefly, this work provides a novel approach for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic materials via enhancing the interfacial electric field.

         <title>Orthorhombic Cobalt Ditelluride with Te Vacancy Defects Anchoring on Elastic MXene Enables Efficient Potassium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) are successfully fabricated to enhance performance in potassium storage. The o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode displays extraordinary structural stability, superior reversible capacity, exceptional rate capability, and long&#8208;term cycling stability, as well as reliable operation in flexible advanced potassium&#8208;ion full batteries.








Abstract
The fast and reversible potassiation/depotassiation of anode materials remains an elusive yet intriguing goal. Herein, a class of the P&#8208;doping&#8208;induced orthorhombic CoTe2 nanowires with Te vacancy defects supported on MXene (o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene) is designed and prepared, taking advantage of the synergistic effects of the conductive o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2 arrays with rich Te vacancy defects and the elastic MXene sheets with self&#8208;autoadjustable function. Consequently, the o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene superstructure exhibits boosted potassium&#8208;storage performance, in terms of high reversible capacity (373.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles), remarkable rate capability (168.2 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and outstanding long&#8208;term cyclability (0.011% capacity decay per cycle over 2000 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1), representing the best performance in transition&#8208;metal&#8208;dichalcogenides&#8208;based anodes to date. Impressively, the flexible full battery with o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene anode achieves a satisfying energy density of 275&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high bending stability. The kinetics analysis and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal superior pseudocapacitive property, high electronic conductivity, and favorable K+ ion adsorption and diffusion capability, corroborating fast K+ ion storage. Especially, ex situ characterizations confirm o&#8208;P&#8208;CoTe2/MXene undergoes reversible evolutions of initially proceeding with the K+ ion insertion, followed by the conversion reaction mechanism.

A simple &#8220;monomers&#8211;nanofibers&#8211;macroscopic product&#8221; hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach for the preparation of all&#8208;aramid bulk and honeycomb materials, which are difficult to process in traditional ways, is demonstrated. These products show excellent mechanical and thermal performance. This work is a breakthrough for the processing of high&#8208;performance engineering polymer material, and the industrialization prospect of all&#8208;aramid products deserves further study.








Abstract
The processing of poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA) has long been a great challenge. This work reports a simple &#8220;monomers&#8208;nanofibers&#8208;macroscopic product&#8221; (MNM) hierarchical self&#8208;assembly approach to build 3D&#160;all&#8208;PPTA engineering materials. This approach mainly includes the preparation of polymerization&#8208;induced aramid nanofibers (PANFs) from monomers and the fabrication of all&#8208;PPTA materials from PANF hydrogel. Various 3D architectures, including simple solid bulks and sophisticated honeycombs (HCs), are obtained after the dehydration and shrinking of the PANF hydrogel. The tensile strength and compressive yield strength of PANF bulk are more than 62 and 90&#160;MPa, respectively, which are comparable to typical engineering plastics. The compressive strength of PANF HC with a density of 360&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;3 is more than 24&#160;MPa. The thermal stability of PANF bulk and PANF HC are as good as that of Kevlar fiber and almost no decomposition occurred before 500&#160;&#176;C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Furthermore, the MNM process is performed under mild conditions, without high temperature, high pressure, or corrosive solvent. The MNM process is a novel strategy for the processing of all aromatic polyamide materials with complex structures and high performances and would be another development since the breakthrough of liquid crystal spinning technology of PPTA.

         <title>Engineering Single&#8208;Atomic Iron&#8208;Catalyst&#8208;Integrated 3D&#8208;Printed Bioscaffolds for Osteosarcoma Destruction with Antibacterial and Bone Defect Regeneration Bioactivity</title>

Single&#8208;atomic&#8208;catalyst&#8208;engineered 3D scaffolds for osteosarcoma therapy and bone regeneration are reported. A single&#8208;atomic iron catalyst with highly effective hyperthermia&#8208;enhanced catalytic radical generating activities is engineered into a 3D&#8208;printed bioglass scaffold to achieve comprehensive osteosarcoma elimination, antibacterial properties, and bone defect regeneration with biocompatibility.








Abstract
Effective antitumor therapeutics with distinctive bactericidal and osteogenic properties are in high demand for comprehensive osteosarcoma treatment. Here, a &#8220;scaffold engineering&#8221; strategy that integrates highly active single&#8208;atomic iron catalysts (FeSAC) into a 3D printed bioactive glass (BG) scaffold is reported. Based on the atomically dispersed iron species within the catalysts, the engineered FeSAC displays prominent Fenton catalytic activity to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) in response to the microenvironment specific to osteosarcoma. In addition, the constructed FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold can serve as a sophisticated biomaterial platform for efficient osteosarcoma ablation, with concomitant bacterial sterilization via localized hyperthermia&#8208;reinforced nanocatalytic therapeutics. The destruction of the osteosarcoma, as well as the bacterial foci, can be achieved, further preventing susceptible chronic osteomyelitis during osteogenesis. In particular, the engineered FeSAC&#8208;BG scaffold is identified with advances in accelerated osteoconduction and osteoinduction, ultimately contributing to the sophisticated therapeutics and management of osteosarcoma. This work broadens the biomedical potential of single&#8208;atom catalysts and offers a comprehensive clinically feasible strategy for overall osteosarcoma therapeutics, bacterial inhibition, and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Nanotexture Shape and Surface Energy Impact on Electroadhesive Human&#8211;Machine Interface Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electroadhesion&#8208;based haptics technology has received substantial attention in recent years and has seen a rapidly expanding inclusion in current ubiquitous interactive touch surfaces. This work studies the underlying multiphysics mechanism at the nanoasperity level and provides a novel insight for the design and optimization of future electroadhesive finger&#8211;device interfaces for higher efficiency and reduced variability.








Abstract
With the ubiquity of touch screens and the commercialization of electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices, modeling tools that capture the multiphysical phenomena within the finger&#8211;device interface and their interaction are critical to design devices that achieve higher performance and reliability at lower cost. While electroadhesion has successfully demonstrated the capability to change tactile perception through friction modulation, the mechanism of electroadhesion in the finger&#8211;device interface is still unclear, partly due to the complex interfacial physics including contact deformation, capillary formation, electric field, and their complicated coupling effects that have not been addressed comprehensively. A multiphysics model is presented here to predict the friction force for finger&#8211;surface tactile interactions at the nanoscale. The nanoscopic multiphysical phenomena are coupled to study the impacts of nanotexture and surface energy in the touch interface. With macroscopic friction force measurements as verification, the model is further used to propose textures that have maximum electroadhesion effect and minimum sensitivity to relative humidity and user perspiration rate. This model can guide the performance improvement of future electroadhesion&#8208;based surface haptic devices and other touch&#8208;based human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Photoluminescence of Fully Inorganic Colloidal Gold Nanocluster and Their Manipulation Using Surface Charge Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The size&#8208;controlled generation of fully inorganic gold nanoclusters is demonstrated by a modern laser&#8208;based synthesis method. These colloidal species exhibit a bright blue photoluminescence, for which the intensity is a direct function of the surface charge density adjustable by the pH of the surrounding medium. Furthermore, these particles offer the opportunity to dedicate photoluminescence to core and surface state transitions.








Abstract
Fully inorganic, colloidal gold nanoclusters (NCs) constitute a new class of nanomaterials that are clearly distinguishable from their commonly studied metal&#8211;organic ligand&#8208;capped counterparts. As their synthesis by chemical methods is challenging, details about their optical properties remain widely unknown. In this work, laser fragmentation in liquids is performed to produce fully inorganic and size&#8208;controlled colloidal gold NCs with monomodal particle size distributions and an fcc&#8208;like structure. Results reveal that these NCs exhibit highly pronounced photoluminescence with quantum yields of 2%. The emission behavior of small (2&#8211;2.5&#160;nm) and ultrasmall (&lt;1&#160;nm) NCs is significantly different and dominated by either core&#8208; or surface&#8208;based emission states. It is further verified that emission intensities are a function of the surface charge density, which is easily controllable by the pH of the surrounding medium. This experimentally observed correlation between surface charge and photoluminescence emission intensity is confirmed by density functional theoretical simulations, demonstrating that fully inorganic NCs provide an appropriate material to bridge the gap between experimental and computational studies of NCs. The presented study deepens the understanding of electronic structures in fully inorganic colloidal gold NCs and how to systematically tune their optical properties via surface charge density and particle size.

         <title>Facet Engineering to Regulate Surface States of Topological Crystalline Insulator Bismuth Rhombic Dodecahedrons for Highly Energy Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topological surface states and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap of Bi rhombic dodecahedrons facilitate highly selective formate production in a wide current density range, leading to a high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (maximum value of 69.5%) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. This electrocatalyst can potentially be used for intermittent energy storage.








Abstract
Bismuth (Bi) is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which has gapless topological surface states (TSSs) protected by a specific crystalline symmetry that strongly depends on the facet. Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single&#8208;crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &gt;92.2%)&#160;in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, leading to a remarkably high full&#8208;cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO2RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO2RR.

&lt;p&gt;The topological surface states and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap of Bi rhombic dodecahedrons facilitate highly selective formate production in a wide current density range, leading to a high full-cell energy efficiency (maximum value of 69.5%) for electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction. This electrocatalyst can potentially be used for intermittent energy storage.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bismuth (Bi) is a topological crystalline insulator (TCI), which has gapless topological surface states (TSSs) protected by a specific crystalline symmetry that strongly depends on the facet. Bi is also a promising electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction (ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) electrocatalyst for formate production. In this study, single-crystalline Bi rhombic dodecahedrons (RDs) exposed with (104) and (110) facets are developed. The Bi RDs demonstrate a very low overpotential and high selectivity for formate production (Faradic efficiency &amp;gt;92.2%)&#160;in a wide partial current density range from 9.8 to 290.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to a remarkably high full-cell energy efficiency (69.5%) for ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. The significantly reduced overpotential is caused by the enhanced *OCHO adsorption on the Bi RDs. The high selectivity of formate can be ascribed to the TSSs and the trivial surface states opening small gaps in the bulk gap on Bi RDs, which strengthens and stabilizes the preferentially adsorbed *OCHO and mitigates the competing adsorption of *H during ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR. This study describes a promising application of Bi RDs for high-rate formate production and high-efficiency energy storage of intermittent renewable electricity. Optimizing the geometry of TCIs is also proposed as an effective strategy to tune the TSSs of topological catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Crowning Metal Ions by Supramolecularization as a General Remedy toward a Dendrite&#8208;Free Alkali&#8208;Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general supramolecularization strategy with size&#8208;matching crown ethers is proposed to protect alkali&#8208;metal anodes (Li, Na, and K). The unique electrostatic shielding layer and organic&#8208;dominated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) induced by the crown ether&#8211;Li+/Na+/K+ assembly effectively inhibit the growth of alkali&#8208;metal dendrites and largely improve the lifespan of alkali&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Alkali metals have low potentials and high capacities, making them ideal anodes for next&#8208;generation batteries, but they suffer major problems, including dendrite growth and low Coulombic efficiency (CE). Achieving uniform metal deposition and having a reliable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are the basic requirements for overcoming these problems. Here, a general remedy is reported for various alkali&#8208;metal anodes by the supramolecularization of alkali&#8208;metal cations with crown ethers that follows a size&#8208;matching rule. The positively charged supramolecular complex provides electrostatic shielding layers to regulate metal deposition and suppress dendrite formation. More promisingly, it reforms electric double layers and drives the production of organic&#8208;dominated SEIs with improved flexibility that can accommodate large volume changes. The high flexibility of SEIs during metal deposition and dissolution reduces the amount of dead metal and improves CE and cycling stability. Specifically, a 200% excess Li&#8208;based full cell has a capacity retention of &#8776;100% after 100 cycles. This crown&#8208;like supramolecularization strategy is a new chemistry that may be used for the production of dendrite&#8208;free metal&#8208;anode&#8208;based batteries not limited to the cases with alkali metal. It is also expected as a practical technology to improve the uniformity of coatings produced in the electrodeposition industry.

         <title>Phase Coexistence and Structural Dynamics of Redox Metal Catalysts Revealed by Operando TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical dynamics (characterized by phase coexistence and oscillatory phase transition) of redox metal catalysts and their relevance to catalytic activity are revealed by operando transmission electron microscopy. This work underlines the importance of chemical dynamics and provides a convenient mechanism for the formation and constant regeneration of transient active sites during catalysis.








Abstract
Metal catalysts play an important role in industrial redox reactions. Although extensively studied, the state of these catalysts under operating conditions is largely unknown, and assignments of active sites remain speculative. Herein, an operando transmission electron microscopy study is presented, which interrelates the structural dynamics of redox metal catalysts to their activity. Using hydrogen oxidation on copper as an elementary redox reaction, it is revealed how the interaction between metal and the surrounding gas phase induces complex structural transformations and drives the system from a thermodynamic equilibrium toward a state controlled by the chemical dynamics. Direct imaging combined with the simultaneous detection of catalytic activity provides unparalleled structure&#8211;activity insights that identify distinct mechanisms for water formation and reveal the means by which the system self&#8208;adjusts to changes of the gas&#8208;phase chemical potential. Density functional theory calculations show that surface phase transitions are driven by chemical dynamics even when the system is far from a thermodynamic phase boundary. In a bottom&#8208;up approach, the dynamic behavior observed here for an elementary reaction is finally extended to more relevant redox reactions and other metal catalysts, which underlines the importance of chemical dynamics for the formation and constant re&#8208;generation of transient active sites during catalysis.

         <title>Harvesting Cool Daylight in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic Halides Microtubules through the Reservation of Pressure&#8208;Induced Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
After pressure processing, the quenched products possess unexpected intense emission exceeding ten times that of the initial state, accompanied by efficient color temperature tuning from weak sky blue to very bright cool daylight. The irreversible electronic transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules, is highly responsible for the eventual retention of pressure&#8208;induced emission.








Abstract
Pressure&#8208;induced emission (PIE) is extensively studied in halide perovskites or derivative hybrid halides. However, owing to the soft inorganic lattice of these materials, the intense emission is barely retained under ambient conditions, thus largely limiting their practical applications in optoelectronics at atmospheric pressure. Here, remarkably enhanced emission in microtubules of the 0D hybrid halide (C5H7N2)2ZnBr4 ((4AMP)2ZnBr4) is successfully achieved by means of pressure treatment at room temperature. Notably, the emission, which is over ten times more intense than the emission in the initial state, is retained under ambient conditions upon the complete release of pressure. Furthermore, the pressure processing enables the tuning of &#8220;sky blue light&#8221; before compression to &#8220;cool daylight&#8221; with a remarkable quantum yield of 88.52% after decompression, which is of considerable interest for applications in next&#8208;generation lighting and displays. The irreversible electronic structural transition, induced by the steric hindrance with respect to complexly configurational organic molecules [4AMP], is highly responsible for the eventual retention of PIE and tuning of the color temperature. The findings represent a significant step toward the capture of PIE under ambient conditions, thus facilitating its potential solid&#8208;state lighting applications.

         <title>A Gas&#8208;Steamed MOF Route to P&#8208;Doped Open Carbon Cages with Enhanced Zn&#8208;Ion Energy Storage Capability and Ultrastability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Just like steaming Chinese buns, a gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) approach is employed to prepare open&#8208;wall carbon cages while simultaneously offering N, P dopants functionalized into a carbon matrix within a one&#8208;step process. Taking the advantages of the fabricated carbon cages with controlled openings and N, P dopants, extraordinary Zn&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage performance is displayed.








Abstract
Carbon micro/nanocages have received great attention, especially in electrochemical energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a solid&#8208;state gas&#8208;steamed metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework approach is designed to fabricate carbon cages with controlled openings on walls, and N, P&#160;dopants. Taking advantage of the fabricated carbon cages with large openings on their walls for enhanced kinetics of mass transport and N, P dopants within the carbon matrix for favoring chemical adsorption of Zn ions, when used as carbon cathodes for advanced aqueous Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs), such open carbon cages (OCCs) display a wide operation voltage of 2.0&#160;V and an enhanced capacity of 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. Also, they exhibit an ultralong cycling lifespan of up to 300&#160;000 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention. Particularly, such OCCs as electrode materials lead to a soft&#8208;pack ZHSC device, delivering a high energy density of 97&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and a superb power density of 6.5&#160;kW kg&#8722;1. Further, the device can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;25 to + 40&#160;&#176;C, covering the temperatures for practical applications in daily life.

Further, the device can operate in a wide temperature range from &#8722;25 to + 40&#160;&#176;C, covering the temperatures for practical applications in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Hypervalent Iodine Compounds as Versatile Reagents for Extremely Efficient and Reversible Patterning of Graphene with Nanoscale Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diversified nanoscale patterning and tailoring of graphene are demonstrated by using hypervalent iodine compounds in combination with laser writing, realizing the first patterned hydroxylation as well as unprecedented degrees of patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation of graphene. The graphene patterning is completely reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over 2D chemical information on graphene.








Abstract
Rational patterning and tailoring of graphene relies on the disclosure of suitable reagents for structuring the target functionalities on the 2D&#8208;carbon network. Here, a series of hypervalent iodine compounds, namely, 1&#8208;chloro&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxol&#8208;3(1H)&#8208;one, 1,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1&#8208;hydroxy&#8208;3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole, and 3,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)&#8208;1,2&#8208;benziodoxole is reported to be extremely efficient for a diversified graphene patterning. The decomposition of these compounds generates highly reactive Cl, OH, and CF3 radicals exclusively in the irradiated areas, which subsequently attach onto the graphene leading to locally controlled chlorination, hydroxylation, and trifluoromethylation, respectively. This is the first realization of a patterned hydroxylation of graphene, and the degrees of functionalization of the patterned chlorination and trifluoromethylation are both unprecedented. The usage of these mild reagents here is reasonably facile compared to the reported methods using hazardous Cl2 or ICl and allows for sophisticated pattern designs with nanoscale precision, promising for arbitrary nanomanipulation of graphene's properties like hydrophilicity and conductivity by the three distinct functionalities (Cl, OH, and CF3). Moreover, the attachment of functional entities to these highly functionalized graphene nanoarchitectures is fully reversible upon thermal annealing, enabling a full writing/storing/reading/erasing control over the chemical information stored within graphene. This work provides an exciting clue for target 2D functionalization and modulation of graphene by using suitable hypervalent iodine compounds.

         <title>Significant Performance Improvement in n&#8208;Channel Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with C60:C70 Co&#8208;Crystals Induced by Poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) Nanodots</title>

18&#8208;fold&#8208;enhanced electron mobility is achieved for n&#8208;channel organic field&#8208;effect transistors with co&#8208;crystalized C60:C70 blend films formed on nanodot&#8208;structured dipolar poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz) interlayers that also reduce the work function of the electrodes. The PEOz nanodot layers further deliver high spatial uniformity in electron mobility and enhance device stability for transistor array fabrication.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) have attracted great interest due to their potential as logic devices for bendable and flexible electronics. In relation to n&#8208;channel structures, soluble fullerene semiconductors have been widely studied. However, they have not yet met the essential requirements for commercialization, primarily because of low charge carrier mobility, immature large&#8208;scale fabrication processes, and insufficient long&#8208;term operational stability. Interfacial engineering of the carrier&#8208;injecting source/drain (S/D) electrodes has been proposed as an effective approach to improve charge injection, leading also to overall improved device characteristics. Here, it is demonstrated that a non&#8208;conjugated neutral dipolar polymer, poly(2&#8208;ethyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PEOz), formed as a nanodot structure on the S/D electrodes, enhances electron mobility in n&#8208;channel OFETs using a range of soluble fullerenes. Overall performance is especially notable for (C60&#8208;Ih)[5,6]fullerene (C60) and (C70&#8208;D5h(6))[5,6]fullerene (C70) blend films, with an increase from 0.1 to 2.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The high relative mobility and eighteen&#8208;fold improvement are attributed not only to the anticipated reduction in S/D electrode work function but also to the beneficial effects of PEOz on the formation of a face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic C60:C70 co&#8208;crystal structure within the blend films.

         <title>Acidity&#8208;Activatable Dynamic Nanoparticles Boosting Ferroptotic Cell Death for Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable nanoparticles integrating dynamic covalent bonds are developed for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibitor RSL&#8208;3 and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Nanoparticle&#8208;based GPX4 inhibition and PDT significantly promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and activate the T&#8208;cell immune response for inhibiting tumor growth and suppressing distant metastasis.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows promising therapeutic potential for long&#8208;term tumor regression. However, current cancer immunotherapy displays a low response rate due to insufficient immunogenicity of the tumor cells. To address these challenges, herein, intracellular&#8208;acidity&#8208;activatable dynamic nanoparticles for eliciting immunogenicity by inducing ferroptosis of the tumor cells are engineered. The nanoparticles are engineered by integrating an ionizable block copolymer and acid&#8208;liable phenylboronate ester (PBE) dynamic covalent bonds for tumor&#8208;specific delivery of the ferroptosis inducer, a glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibitor RSL&#8208;3. The nanoparticles can stably encapsulate RSL&#8208;3 inside the hydrophobic core via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction with the PBE groups at neutral pH (pH = 7.4), while releasing the payload in the endocytic vesicles (pH = 5.8&#8211;6.2) by acidity&#8208;triggered cleavage of the PBE dynamic covalent bonds. Furthermore, the nanoparticles can perform acid&#8208;activatable photodynamic therapy&#160;by protonation of the ionizable core, and significantly recruit tumor&#8208;infiltrating T lymphocytes for interferon gamma secretion, and thus sensitize the tumor cells to RSL&#8208;3&#8208;inducible ferroptosis. The combination of nanoparticle&#8208;induced ferroptosis and blockade of programmed death ligand 1&#160;efficiently inhibits growth of B16&#8208;F10 melanoma tumor and lung metastasis of 4T1 breast tumors, suggesting the promising potential of ferroptosis induction for promoting cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Dynamically Crosslinked Dry Ion&#8208;Conducting Elastomers for Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamically crosslinked dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomers with exceptional properties of high ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, stretchability, and transparency are reported. Two self&#8208;healing stretchable iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are then realized with excellent environmental stability.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors show great promise in multifunctional iontronic devices, but currently utilized gel materials suffer from liquid leakage or evaporation issues. Here, a dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer with dynamic crosslinking structures is reported. The dynamic crosslinking structures endow it with combined advantageous properties simultaneously, including high ionic conductivity (2.04 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C), self&#8208;healing capability (96% healing efficiency), stretchability (563%), and transparency (78%). With this ionic conductor as the electrode, two soft iontronic devices (electroluminescent devices and triboelectric nanogenerator tactile sensors) are realized with entirely self&#8208;healing and stretchable capabilities. Due to the absence of liquid materials, the dry ion&#8208;conducting elastomer shows wide operational temperature range, and the iontronic devices achieve excellent stability. These findings provide a promising strategy to achieve highly conductive and multifunctional soft dry ionic conductors, and demonstrate their great potential in soft iontronics or electronics.

         <title>Expanding Biomaterial Surface Topographical Design Space through Natural Surface Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The topographical design space is immense, with many geometries existing. To explore this design space on cell behavior, the TopoChip is utilized with 2176 unique microtopographies. Nevertheless, phenotypical readouts are potentially lost due to an incomplete design space coverage. This coverage is expanded effectively in this work by including natural surfaces such as the red rose, leading to novel phenotypical discoveries.








Abstract
Surface topography is a tool to endow biomaterials with bioactive properties. However, the large number of possible designs makes it challenging to find the optimal surface structure to induce a specific cell response. The TopoChip platform is currently the largest collection of topographies with 2176 in silico designed microtopographies. Still, it is exploring only a small part of the design space due to design algorithm limitations and the surface engineering strategy. Inspired by the diversity of natural surfaces, it is assessed as to what extent the topographical design space and consequently the resulting cellular responses can be expanded using natural surfaces. To this end, 26 plant and insect surfaces are replicated in polystyrene and their surface properties are quantified using white light interferometry. Through machine&#8208;learning algorithms, it is demonstrated that natural surfaces extend the design space of the TopoChip, which coincides with distinct morphological and focal adhesion profiles in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Furthermore, differentiation experiments reveal the strong potential of the holy lotus to improve osteogenesis in MSCs. In the future, the design algorithms will be trained with the results obtained by natural surface imprint experiments to explore the bioactive properties of novel surface topographies.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202100628"&gt;2100628&lt;/a&gt;, Wassana Yantasee and co-workers investigate how Augmenting Immune Response and Inhibiting Suppressive Environment of tumors-02 (AIRISE-02) activates an antitumor immune response. AIRISE-02 is a nanoparticle co-delivering STAT3 siRNA and CpG intratumorally, utilizing local tumor antigens to train the immune system to kill cancer throughout the body. AIRISE-02 shows strong efficacy in various tumor models, and favorable safety in mice and monkeys.

Immunotherapy&#8208;involved combination cancer therapy: the rapid development in the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities for cancer therapy are systematically reviewed, and the critical challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy that can activate immunity or enhance the immunogenicity of tumors has emerged as one of the most effective methods for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, single&#8208;mode immunotherapy is still confronted with several critical challenges, such as the low immune response, the low tumor infiltration, and the complex immunosuppression tumor microenvironment. Recently, the combination of immunotherapy with other therapeutic modalities has emerged as a powerful strategy to augment the therapeutic outcome in fighting against cancer. In this review, recent research advances of the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy, phototherapy, radiotherapy, sonodynamic therapy, metabolic therapy, and microwave thermotherapy are summarized. Critical challenges and future research direction of immunotherapy&#8208;based cancer therapeutic strategy are also discussed.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Silicene/Silicon Nanosheets: An Emerging Silicon&#8208;Composed Nanostructure in Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The developments in the construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8208;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics and antibacteria, are highlighted. A multi variate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these silicene/silicon nanosheets is conducted and an outlook for further clinical translations is given.








Abstract
Silicon&#8208;composed nanomedicines are one of the most representative inorganic nanosystems in theranostic biomedicine. The emerging of new family members of silicon&#8208;composed nanosystems substantially contributes to their further clinical translation. 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have recently been developed as an emerging topology of silicon&#8208;composed nanoparticles, which features unique planar nanostructure with large surface area, abundant surface chemistry, specific physiochemical property, and desirable biological effects. This progress report highlights and discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;art developments of the elaborate construction of 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets for versatile biomedical applications, including top&#8211;down fabrication, multifunctionalization, surface engineering, and their available biomedical applications in tumor theranostics (e.g., bioimaging, photothermal ablation, chemotherapy, chemoreactive nanotherapy, radiotherapy, and synergistic nanotherapy) and antibacteria. Their large surface area originating from 2D nanostructure not only enables efficient loading and delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs, but also guarantees the multifunctionalization. Especially, 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets harness desirable photothermal&#8208;conversion performance for photonic hyperthermia and photoacoustic imaging in the near infrared biowindow, accompanied with the desirable biodegradability and biocompatibility, which is typically not possessed in other silicon&#8208;composed counterparts. The multivariate analysis on the facing challenges and future developments of these 2D silicene/silicon nanosheets have also been conducted and outlooked for further underpinning their clinical translations.

A timely summary of the fantastic achievements in the field of organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) is provided with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;efficiency OLET devices. Finally, a brief conclusion is also given with comments on the challenges and prospective future research directions in this field. All these suggest a new development stage for OLETs and their related application fields under the joint efforts of scientists from different fields.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) are possibly the smallest integrated optoelectronic devices that combine the switching and amplification mechanisms of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) and the electroluminescent characteristic of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Such a unique architecture of OLETs makes them ideal for developing the next&#8208;generation display technology and electrically pumped lasers for miniaturized photonic devices and circuits. However, the development of OLETs has been slow. Recently, some exciting progress has been made with breakthroughs in high mobility emissive organic semiconductors, construction of high&#8208;performance OLETs, and fabrication of novel multifunctional OLETs. This recent slew of advances may represent the advent of a new development stage of OLETs and their related devices and circuits. In this paper, a detailed review of these fantastic advances is presented, with a special focus on the key points for developing high&#8208;performance OLETs. Finally, a brief conclusion is provided with a discussion on the challenges and future perspectives in this field.

The hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of hydrogen fuel. Alkaline water splitting represents the most mature and economic technology for clean hydrogen production, making high potential for successful implementation of hydrogen economy.








Abstract
Hydrogen economy has emerged as a very promising alternative to the current hydrocarbon economy, which involves the process of harvesting renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen and then further utilization of clean hydrogen fuel. The production of hydrogen by water electrolysis is an essential prerequisite of the hydrogen economy with zero carbon emission. Among various water electrolysis technologies, alkaline water splitting has been commercialized for more than 100 years, representing the most mature and economic technology. Here, the historic development of water electrolysis is overviewed, and several critical electrochemical parameters are discussed. After that, advanced nonprecious metal electrocatalysts that emerged recently for negotiating the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are discussed, including transition metal oxides, (oxy)hydroxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides for the OER, as well as transition metal alloys, chalcogenides, phosphides, and carbides for the HER. In this section, particular attention is paid to the catalyst synthesis, activity and stability challenges, performance improvement, and industry&#8208;relevant developments. Some recent works about scaled&#8208;up catalyst synthesis, novel electrode designs, and alkaline seawater electrolysis are also spotlighted. Finally, an outlook on future challenges and opportunities for alkaline water splitting is offered, and potential future directions are speculated.

         <title>Mapping the Design of Electrolyte Materials for Electrically Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrolyte materials play a significant role in the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and low&#8208;cost electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries. The challenges and progress in electrolyte materials are presented, with the aim of providing insight into the future development of novel electrolyte systems for electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Electrically rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ERZABs) have attracted substantial research interest as one of the best candidate power sources for electric vehicles, grid&#8208;scale energy storage, and portable electronics owing to their high theoretical capacity, low cost, and environmental benignity. However, the realization of ERZABs with long cycle life and high energy and power densities is still a considerable challenge. The electrolyte, which serves as the ionic conductor, is one of the core components of ERZABs, as it plays a significant role during the discharge&#8211;charge process and greatly influences the rechargeability, operating voltage, lifespan, power density, and safety of ERZABs. Herein, the fundamental electrochemistry of electrolyte materials for ERZABs and the associated challenges are presented. Furthermore, recent advances in electrolyte materials for ERZABs, including alkaline aqueous electrolytes, nonalkaline electrolytes, ionic liquids, and semisolid&#8208;state electrolytes are discussed. This work aims to provide insights into the future exploration of high&#8208;performance electrolytes and thus promote the development of ERZABs.

         <title>Progress of Nonprecious&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 31, August 5, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water oxidation, also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for hydrogen generation and the carbon dioxide reduction. The thermodynamics, Pourbaix diagram, theoretical screening and prediction, catalytic performance, as well as reaction kinetics and mechanisms of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are comprehensively summarized.








Abstract
Water oxidation, or the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which combines two oxygen atoms from two water molecules and releases one oxygen molecule, plays the key role by providing protons and electrons needed for the hydrogen generation, electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen fixation. The multielectron transfer OER process involves multiple reaction intermediates, and a high overpotential is needed to overcome the sluggish kinetics. Among the different water splitting devices, proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer offers greater advantages. However, current anode OER electrocatalysts in PEM electrolyzers are limited to precious iridium and ruthenium oxides. Developing highly active, stable, and precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for water oxidation in acidic media is attractive for the large&#8208;scale application of PEM electrolyzers. In recent years, various types of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free catalysts such as carbon&#8208;based materials, earth&#8208;abundant transition metal oxides, and multiple metal oxide mixtures have been investigated and some of them show promising activity and stability for acidic OER. In this review, the thermodynamics of water oxidation, Pourbaix diagram of metal elements in aqueous solution, and theoretical screening and prediction of precious&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for acidic OER are first elaborated. The catalytic performance, reaction kinetics, and mechanisms together with future research directions regarding acidic OER are summarized and discussed.

         <title>Design of Highly Durable Core&#8722;Shell Catalysts by Controlling Shell Distribution Guided by In&#8208;Situ Corrosion Study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors demonstrate that in&#8208;situ liquid cell transmission electron microscopy observation can guide the design of highly durable electrocatalysts, which is further verified by in&#8208;situ corrosion and practical cyclic voltammetry measurements with the loss of 0.37% and 9.01% in specific and mass activities towards oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Most degradations in electrocatalysis are caused by corrosion in operation, for example the corrosion of the core in a core&#8722;shell electrocatalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Herein, according to the in&#8208;situ study on nanoscale corrosion kinetics via liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LC&#8208;TEM) in the authors&#8217; previous work, they sequentially designed an optimized nanocube with the protection of more layers on the corners by adjusting the Pt atom distribution on corners and terraces. This modified nanocube (MNC) is much more corrosion resistant in the in&#8208;situ observation. Furthermore, in the practical electrochemical stability testing, the MNC catalyst also showed the best stability performance with the 0.37% and 9.01% loss in specific and mass activity after 30&#8201;000 cycles accelerated durability test (ADT). This work also demonstrates that how an in&#8208;situ study can guide the design of desired materials with improved properties and build a bridge between in&#8208;situ study and practical application.

         <title>Uranium In Situ Electrolytic Deposition with a Reusable Functional Graphene&#8208;Foam Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reusable 3D functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D&#8208;FrGOF) is used as an in situ electrolytic deposition electrode to extract uranium from contaminated water. The specific U(VI) extraction capacity is 4560&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and the Coulombic efficiency is 54%. Moreover, uranium in spiked seawater is reduced from 3&#160;ppm to less than 19.9 ppb (the US Environmental Protection Agency drinking water limit is 30 ppb).








Abstract
Nuclear fission produces 400 GWe which represents 11% of the global electricity output. Uranium is the essential element as both fission fuel and radioactive waste. Therefore, the recovery of uranium is of great importance. Here, an in situ electrolytic deposition method to extract uranium from aqueous solution is reported. A functionalized reduced graphene oxide foam (3D&#8208;FrGOF) is used as the working electrode, which acts as both a hydrogen evolution reaction catalyst and a uranium deposition substrate. The specific electrolytic deposition capacity for U(VI) ions with the 3D&#8208;FrGOF is 4560&#160;mg g&#8722;1 without reaching saturation, and the Coulombic efficiency can reach 54%. Moreover, reduction of the uranium concentration in spiked seawater from 3&#160;ppm to 19.9 ppb is achieved, which is lower than the US Environmental Protection Agency uranium limits for drinking water (30 ppb). Furthermore, the collection electrode can be efficiently regenerated and recycled at least nine times without much efficiency fading, by ejecting into 2000&#160;ppm concentrated uranium solution in a second bath with reverse voltage bias. All these findings open new opportunities in using free&#8208;standing 3D&#8208;FrGOF electrode as an advanced separation technique for water treatment.

         <title>Construction of a Porous Metal&#8211;Organic Framework with a High Density of Open Cr Sites for Record N2/O2 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N2&#8208;selective metal&#8211;organic framework material TYUT&#8208;96Cr, with dual open Cr (III) sites, record&#8208;high N2 capture capacity, and N2/O2 selectivity is developed, showing the highest separation performance, far beyond the current adsorbent. Importantly, this material displays ultrahigh structural stability under water, acid/base, and humidity conditions, being practically useful for O2 separation and purification in industry.








Abstract
The removal of low concentration N2 is of great significance and challenging in the industrial production of high&#8208;purity O2. Herein, a chromium&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework, namely, TYUT&#8208;96Cr, is reported, which has an unprecedented N2 capture capacity of 37.46 cm3 cm&#8722;3 and N2/O2 (5:95, v/v) selectivity up to 26.95 (298 K and 1 bar), thus setting new benchmarks for all reported metal&#8211;organic frameworks and commercially used ones (Li&#8208;LSX and 13X). Breakthrough experiments reveal that N2 can be directly extracted from various N2/O2 (79:21, 50:50, 5:95, and 1:99, v/v) mixtures by this material, affording a record&#8208;high O2&#8208;production scale with 99.99% purity. Density functional theory calculations and in situ infrared spectroscopy studies demonstrate that the high&#8208;density open Cr (III) sites in TYUT&#8208;96Cr can behave as effective Lewis acidic sites, thus resulting in a strong affinity toward N2. The high N2 adsorption selectivity, exceptional separation performance, and ultrahigh structural stability render this porous material with great potential for this important industrial application.

         <title>Superfast Water Transport Zwitterionic Polymeric Nanofluidic Membrane Reinforced by Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rigid&#8208;scaffold&#8208;reinforced polymeric nanoparticles&#8217; interfacial channel strategy is proposed for fabricating nanofluidic membranes that exhibit water permeance and dye/salt selectivity that are 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional polymeric membranes. The unprecedented separation performance is due to the paradigm shift of water transport from conventional viscos flow to ultrafast nanofluidic flow in the membrane nanofluidics.








Abstract
Nanofluidics derived from low&#8208;dimensional nanosheets and protein nanochannels are crucial for advanced catalysis, sensing, and separation. However, polymer nanofluidics is halted by complicated preparation and miniaturized sizes. This work reports the bottom&#8208;up synthesis of modular nanofluidics by confined growth of ultrathin metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in a polymer membrane consisting of zwitterionic dopamine nanoparticles (ZNPs). The confined growth of the MOFs on the ZNPs reduces the chain entanglement between the ZNPs, leading to stiff interfacial channels enhancing the nanofluidic transport of water molecules through the membrane. As such, the water permeability and solute selectivity of MOF@ZNPM are one magnitude improved, leading to a record&#8208;high performance among all polymer nanofiltration membranes. Both the experimental work and the molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the water transport is shifted from high&#8208;friction&#8208;resistance conventional viscous flow to ultrafast nanofluidic flow as a result of rigid and continuous nanochannels in MOF@ZNPM.

         <title>Electrolyte Design Enabling a High&#8208;Safety and High&#8208;Performance Si Anode with a Tailored Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonflammable and ether&#8208;based electrolyte is formulated here in enabling a highly stabilized Si anode and the LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC532) cathode. High reversible capacity of the Si electrode is retained at 2041.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles, with capacity fading rate of 0.0615% per cycle. A full cell coupling unmodified Si with commercial NMC532 cathode demonstrates cycle life to 60 cycles.








Abstract
Silicon (Si) anodes are advantageous for application in lithium&#8208;ion batteries in terms of their high theoretical capacity (4200 mAh g&#8722;1), appropriate operating voltage (&lt;0.4&#160;V vs Li/Li+), and earth&#8208;abundancy. Nevertheless, a large volume change of Si particles emerges with cycling, triggering unceasing breakage/re&#8208;formation of the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and thereby the fast capacity degradation in traditional carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes. Herein, it is demonstrated that superior cyclability of Si anode is achievable using a nonflammable ether&#8208;based electrolyte with fluoroethylene carbonate and lithium oxalyldifluoroborate dual additives. By forming a high&#8208;modulus SEI rich in fluoride (F) and boron (B) species, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 90.2% is attained in Si/Li cells, accompanied with a low capacity&#8208;fading rate of only 0.0615% per cycle (discharge capacity of 2041.9 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles). Full cells pairing the unmodified Si anode with commercial LiFePO4 (&#8776;13.92&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (&#8776;17.9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathodes further show extended service life to 150 and 60 cycles, respectively, demonstrating the superior cathode&#8208;compatibility realized with a thin and F, B&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interface. This work offers an easily scalable approach in developing high&#8208;performance Si&#8208;based batteries through Si/electrolyte interphase regulation.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active MXene&#8208;Based Bifunctional ORR/OER Double&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) show the most promising bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)/oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performances. The bifunctional catalytic activities of DACs improve with increasing strain. Theoretical models are presented for plotting the polarization curves of OER/ORR catalysis to demonstrate the bifunctional catalytic performance of the studied catalysts.








Abstract
Designing highly active and bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts has attracted great interest toward metal&#8211;air batteries. Herein, an efficient solution to the search for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts is proposed by introducing non&#8208;noble metals such as Fe/Co/Ni at the surfaces. These results indicate that the ultrahigh activities in Ni1/Ni2&#8208; and Fe1/Ni2&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;based double&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) for bifunctional ORR/OER are better than those of well&#8208;known unifunctional catalysts with low overpotentials, such as Pt(111) for the ORR and IrO2(110) for the OER. Strain can profoundly regulate the catalytic activities of MXene&#8208;based DACs, providing a novel pathway for tunable catalytic behavior in flexible MXenes. An electrochemical model, based on density functional theory and theoretical polarization curves, is proposed to reveal the underlying mechanisms, in agreement with experimental results. Electronic structure analyses indicate that the excellent catalytic activities in the MXene&#8208;based DACs are attributed to the electron&#8208;capturing capability and synergistic interactions between Fe/Co/Ni adsorbents and MXene substrate. These findings not only reveal promising candidates for MXene&#8208;based bifunctional ORR/OER catalysts but also provide new theoretical insights into rationally designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free bifunctional DACs.

         <title>Efficient Blue Light Emitting Diodes Based On Europium Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ideal blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting materials should simultaneously achieve narrow emission linewidth, suitable Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage color coordinate, excellent stability, good manufacturing compatibility, as well as, non&#8208;toxic composition, which are rarely observed in previously reported materials. The design of robust and efficient lanthanide based halide perovskites CsEuBr3 offers one possible solution for this long&#8208;standing challenge.








Abstract
Flat panel displays enjoy 100 billion&#8208;dollar markets with significant penetration in daily life, which require efficient, color&#8208;saturated blue, green, and red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). The recently emerged halide perovskites have demonstrated low&#8208;cost and outstanding performance for potential LED applications. However, the performance of blue perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) lags far behind red and green cousins, particularly for color coordinates approaching (0.131, 0.046) that fulfill the Rec. 2020 specification for blue emitters. Here, a high&#8208;efficiency, lead&#8208;free perovskite, CsEuBr3, is reported that exhibits bright blue exciton emission centered at 448&#160;nm with a color coordinates of (0.15, 0.04), contributed from Eu&#8208;5d&#8594;Eu&#8208;4f/Br&#8208;4p transition with an optical band gap of 2.85&#160;eV. Further optical characterizations reveal its short excited&#8208;state lifetime of 151&#160;ns, excellent exciton diffusion diffusivity of 0.0227 cm2 s&#8722;1, and high quantum yield of &#8776;69%. Inspired by these findings, deep&#8208;blue PeLEDs based on all&#8208;vacuum processing methods, which have been demonstrated as the most successful approach for the organic LED industry, are constructed. The devices show a maximum external quantum efficiency of 6.5% with an operating half&#8208;lifetime of 50 mins at an initial brightness of 15.9&#160;cd m&#8722;2. It is anticipated that this work will inspire further research on lanthanide&#8208;based perovskites for next&#8208;generation LED applications.

         <title>Strong Suppression of Thermal Conductivity in the Presence of Long Terminal Alkyl Chains in Low&#8208;Disorder Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation identifies a significant drop in in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity upon end alkylation of the aromatic rings of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (DNTT), which is understood from a detailed vibrational&#8208;mode analysis. Combined with their enhanced charge transport, the results suggest the possibility of decoupling electron and phonon transport in alkylated DNTT systems, which opens pathways for improved thermoelectric applications.








Abstract
While the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors have been extensively studied over the recent years, the field of organics&#8208;based thermoelectrics is still limited by a lack of experimental data on thermal transport and of understanding of the associated structure&#8211;property relationships. To fill this gap, a comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of the lattice thermal conductivity in polycrystalline thin films of dinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (Cn&#8208;DNTT&#8208;Cn with n&#160;= 0, 8) semiconductors is reported. Strikingly, thermal conductivity appears to be much more isotropic than charge transport, which is confined to the 2D molecular layers. A direct comparison between experimental measurements (3&#969;&#8211;V&#246;lklein method) and theoretical estimations (approach&#8208;to&#8208;equilibrium molecular dynamics (AEMD) method) indicates that the in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity is strongly reduced in the presence of the long terminal alkyl chains. This evolution can be rationalized by the strong localization of the intermolecular vibrational modes in C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8 in comparison to unsubstituted DNTT cores, as evidenced by a vibrational mode analysis. Combined with the enhanced charge transport properties of alkylated DNTT systems, this opens the possibility to decouple electron and phonon transport in these materials, which provides great potential for enhancing the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT.

         <title>Low&#8208;Density Fluorinated Silane Solvent Enhancing Deep Cycle Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries&#8217; Lifetime</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors propose a new class of bi&#8208;functional fluorinated silane&#8208;based electrolyte with a low density. This electrolyte can not only effectively reduce the electrolyte weight/cell capacity in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, but also form a robust solid electrolyte interface to minimize lithium depletion. Hence, long&#8208;term cycling Li&#8211;S pouch cells were&#160;obtained under lean&#8208;electrolyte and low lithium excess.








Abstract
The lithium metal anode (LMA) instability at deep cycle with high utilization is a crucial barrier for developing lithium (Li) metal batteries, resulting in excessive Li inventory and electrolyte demand. This issue becomes more severe in capacity&#8208;type lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. High&#8208;concentration or localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes are noted as effective strategies to stabilize Li metal but usually lead to a high electrolyte density (&gt;1.4&#160;g mL&#8722;1). Here we&#160;propose a bifunctional fluorinated silane&#8208;based electrolyte with a low density of 1.0&#160;g mL&#8722;1 that not only is much lighter than conventional electrolytes (&#8776;1.2&#160;g mL&#8722;1) but also form a robust solid electrolyte interface to minimize Li depletion. Therefore, the Li loss rate is reduced over 4.5&#8208;fold with the proposed electrolyte relative to its conventional counterpart. When paired with onefold excess LMA at the electrolyte weight/cell capacity (E/C) ratio of 4.5&#160;g Ah&#8722;1, the Li&#8211;S pouch cell using our&#160;electrolyte can survive for 103 cycles, much longer than with the conventional electrolyte (38 cycles). This demonstrates that our&#160;electrolyte not only reduces the E/C ratio but also enhances the cyclic stability of Li&#8211;S batteries under limited Li amounts.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Blown Spun Silk/Graphene Nanoionotronic Skin for Multifunctional Fire Protection and Alarm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;retardant silk/graphene nanoionotronic (SGNI) skin with sensitive fire alarm property is fabricated using electro&#8208;blown spinning. The SGNI skin adheres to the target surface and serves as an alarm. Once exposed to fire, the SGNI skin senses the fire source and quickly sends an alarm to the control center and cell phone.








Abstract
Artificial protective skins are widely used in artificial intelligence robots, such as humanoid robots, mobile manipulation robots, and automatic probe robots, but their safety in use, especially flame retardancy, is rarely considered. As many artificial skins are designed for use in flammable or even explosive environments, flammability is a significant concern. Herein, a flame&#8208;retardant silk/graphene nanoionotronic (SGNI) skin is developed by using a rationally designed high&#8208;throughput electro&#8208;blown spinning technique, with a more efficient production efficiency than electrospinning. These flame retardant SGNI skins combine the advantages of nanofibrous and ionotronic materials, and they are sustainable, conductive, highly porous, mechanically robust, highly stretchable, self&#8208;adhesive, and humidity&#8208; and temperature&#8208;sensitive. These merits support the assembly of SGNI skins into a fire alarm system, with real&#8208;time alarm (response in 2 s) to mobile phones, clouds, and a central control system. The concept that combines a flame retardant and fire alarm material into an intelligent skin may provide potential solutions toward the design of protective skins for robotics and human&#8211;machine interactions.

         <title>Confinement of Ultrasmall Bimetallic Nanoparticles in Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Site&#8208;Specific Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) are confined in pores of 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs). The BNPs in cMOFs significantly improve the NO2&#8208;sensing performance, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of cMOF.








Abstract
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are emerging materials for various applications due to their high surface area, high porosity, and electrical conductivity. However, it is still challenging to develop cMOFs having high surface reactivity and durability. Here, highly active and stable cMOF are presented via the confinement of bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) in the pores of a 2D cMOF, where the confinement is guided by dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced site&#8208;specific nucleation. Heterogeneous metal precursors are bound to the pores of 2D cMOFs by dipolar interactions, and the subsequent reduction produces ultrasmall (&#8776;1.54&#160;nm) and well&#8208;dispersed PtRu NPs confined in the pores of the cMOF. PtRu&#8208;NP&#8208;decorated cMOFs exhibit significantly enhanced chemiresistive NO2 sensing performances, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of cMOF.

     alt="Confinement of Ultrasmall Bimetallic Nanoparticles in Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Site-Specific Nucleation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) are confined in pores of 2D conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs). The BNPs in cMOFs significantly improve the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensing performance, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of cMOF.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (cMOFs) are emerging materials for various applications due to their high surface area, high porosity, and electrical conductivity. However, it is still challenging to develop cMOFs having high surface reactivity and durability. Here, highly active and stable cMOF are presented via the confinement of bimetallic nanoparticles (BNPs) in the pores of a 2D cMOF, where the confinement is guided by dipolar-interaction-induced site-specific nucleation. Heterogeneous metal precursors are bound to the pores of 2D cMOFs by dipolar interactions, and the subsequent reduction produces ultrasmall (&#8776;1.54&#160;nm) and well-dispersed PtRu NPs confined in the pores of the cMOF. PtRu-NP-decorated cMOFs exhibit significantly enhanced chemiresistive NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sensing performances, owing to the bimetallic synergies of PtRu NPs and the high surface area and porosity of cMOF. The approach paves the way for the synthesis of highly active and conductive porous materials via bimetallic and/or multimetallic NP loading.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>An Anti&#8208;Fatigue Design Strategy for 3D Ribbon&#8208;Shaped Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents an anti&#8208;fatigue strategy to significantly prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped flexible electronics by switching the metal&#8208;dominated failure to desired polymer&#8208;dominated failure. Combined in situ measurements and computations allow the establishment of a failure criterion capable of accurately predicting fatigue lives under compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of anti&#8208;fatigue mesostructures with diverse 3D geometries.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) flexible electronics represent an emerging area of intensive attention in recent years, owing to their broad&#8208;ranging applications in wearable electronics, flexible robots, tissue/cell scaffolds, among others. The widely adopted 3D conductive mesostructures in the functional device systems would inevitably undergo repetitive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane compressions during practical operations, and thus, anti&#8208;fatigue design strategies are of great significance to improve the reliability of 3D flexible electronics. Previous studies mainly focused on the fatigue failure behavior of planar ribbon&#8208;shaped geometries, while anti&#8208;fatigue design strategies and predictive failure criteria addressing 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped mesostructures are still lacking. This work demonstrates an anti&#8208;fatigue strategy to significantly prolong the fatigue life of 3D ribbon&#8208;shaped flexible electronics by switching the metal&#8208;dominated failure to desired polymer&#8208;dominated failure. Combined in situ measurements and computational studies allow the establishment of a failure criterion capable of accurately predicting fatigue lives under out&#8208;of&#8208;plane compressions, thereby providing useful guidelines for the design of anti&#8208;fatigue mesostructures with diverse 3D geometries. Two mechanically reliable 3D devices, including a resistance&#8208;type vibration sensor and a janus sensor capable of decoupled temperature measurements, serve as two demonstrative examples to highlight potential applications in long&#8208;term health monitoring and human&#8208;like robotic perception, respectively.

         <title>Spectroscopic Perception of Trap States on the Performance of Methylammonium and Formamidinium Lead Iodide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic mechanisms of doping effects on improving or decreasing the efficiency of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) solar cells are qualitatively and quantitatively clarified. The influences of the doping concentration, defects, trap density, and carrier mobility on the parameters (JSC, VOC, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency) of OIHP solar cells are identified by means of spectroscopic investigations.








Abstract
To enhance the efficiency and stability of the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite (OIHP) solar cells, doping has been demonstrated as a straightforward method. Nevertheless, the perception of trap states regulated by doping and their effects on the performance of solar cells is not in&#8208;depth. Herein, typical OIHPs (CH3NH3PbI3 and Cs0.05FA0.85MA0.10Pb(I0.97Br0.03)3) doped with RbI are employed to expound the doping mechanism in affecting the efficiency of devices. Systematic spectroscopic characterizations indicate that doping significantly influences the photocarrier dynamics via directly regulating the trap states. The results indicate that doping would reduce the trap density by passivating defects and induce extra trapping centers. This directly manipulates the transient transport of the photocarriers and finally influences the output of devices. The optimization of solar cell performance requires the tradeoff of competitive relation between the passivation and introduction of trapping centers. The results provide the spectroscopic perception on how doping concentration affects trap density, carrier dynamics, transport behavior, and ultimately the parameters of devices. It provides a straightforward guidance to the design and optimization of OIHP&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>iSens: A Fiber&#8208;Based, Highly Permeable and Imperceptible Sensor Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Permeable sensors fabricated of paper or glass fibers for measuring the temperature and monitoring the curing of adhesives during production. The paper substrate fits seamlessly into the wooden construction material, while in the case of composite materials the authors electrically functionalize the glass fibers themselves. This technology ushers in a new generation of imperceptible sensors (iSens) and devices.








Abstract
Embedded sensors are key to optimizing processes and products; they collect data that allow time, energy, and materials to be saved, thereby reducing costs. After production, they remain in place and are used to monitor the long&#8208;term structural health of buildings or aircraft. Fueled by climate change, sustainable construction materials such as wood and fiber composites are gaining importance. Current sensors are not optimized for use with these materials and often act as defects that cause catastrophic failures. Here, flexible, highly permeable, and imperceptible sensors (iSens) are introduced that integrate seamlessly into a component. Their porous substrates are readily infused with adhesives and withstand harsh conditions. In situ resistive temperature measurements and capacitive sensing allows monitoring of adhesives curing as used in wooden structures and fiber composites. The devices also act as heating elements to reduce the hardening time of the glue. Results are analyzed using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. The suggested iSens technology is widely applicable and represents a step towards realizing the Internet of Things for construction materials.

         <title>Quantitative In Situ Visualization of Thermal Effects on the Formation of Gold Nanocrystals in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is revealed how the temperature affects the formation of gold nanoparticles in water by liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy. Thermal effects on the nucleation and growth rates of colloidal assemblies match with the classical models for nanoparticle formation but the direct observation of single nanoparticle dynamics provides new in situ insights into the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms governing the size and shape of nanostructures.








Abstract
Understanding temperature effects in nanochemistry requires real&#8208;time in situ measurements because this key parameter of wet&#8208;chemical synthesis simultaneously influences the kinetics of chemical reactions and the thermodynamic equilibrium of nanomaterials in solution. Here, temperature&#8208;controlled liquid cell transmission electron microscopy is exploited to directly image the radiolysis&#8208;driven formation of gold nanoparticles between 25 &#176;C and 85 &#176;C and provide a deeper understanding of the atomic&#8208;scale processes determining the size and shape of gold colloids. By quantitatively comparing the nucleation and growth rates of colloidal assemblies with classical models for nanocrystal formation, it is shown that the increase of the molecular diffusion and the solubility of gold governs the drastic changes in the formation dynamics of nanostructures in solution with temperature. In contraction with the common view of coarsening processes in solution, it is also demonstrated that the dissolution of nanoparticles and thus the Ostwald ripening is not only driven by size effects. Furthermore, visualizing thermal effects on faceting processes at the single nanoparticle level reveals how the competition between the growth speed and the surface diffusion dictates the final shape of nanocrystals.

         <title>Reducing Water Activity by Zeolite Molecular Sieve Membrane for Long&#8208;Life Rechargeable Zinc Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zeolite molecular sieve is demonstrated to reduce water activity and is employed for high&#8208;performance zinc anode. Spectroscopy and simulation characterizations identify that zeolite molecular sieve&#8208;modified electrolyte renders a highly aggressive solvation sheath and, restrains the activity of water molecule. Benefitting from the regulation, zinc anode demonstrates a compact deposition and superior stability with less side&#8208;product generation.








Abstract
Aqueous electrolytes offer major advantages in safe battery operation, green economy, and low production cost for advanced battery technology. However, strong water activity in aqueous electrolytes provokes a hydrogen evolution reaction and parasitic passivation on electrodes, leaving poor ion&#8208;transport in the electrolyte/electrode interface. Herein, a zeolite molecular sieve&#8208;modified (zeolite&#8208;modified) aqueous electrolyte is proposed to reduce water activity and its side&#8208;reaction. First, Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly aggressive solvation configuration and significantly suppressed water activity toward single water molecule.

     alt="Reducing Water Activity by Zeolite Molecular Sieve Membrane for Long-Life Rechargeable Zinc Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeolite molecular sieve is demonstrated to reduce water activity and is employed for high-performance zinc anode. Spectroscopy and simulation characterizations identify that zeolite molecular sieve-modified electrolyte renders a highly aggressive solvation sheath and, restrains the activity of water molecule. Benefitting from the regulation, zinc anode demonstrates a compact deposition and superior stability with less side-product generation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous electrolytes offer major advantages in safe battery operation, green economy, and low production cost for advanced battery technology. However, strong water activity in aqueous electrolytes provokes a hydrogen evolution reaction and parasitic passivation on electrodes, leaving poor ion-transport in the electrolyte/electrode interface. Herein, a zeolite molecular sieve-modified (zeolite-modified) aqueous electrolyte is proposed to reduce water activity and its side-reaction. First, Raman spectroscopy reveals a highly aggressive solvation configuration and significantly suppressed water activity toward single water molecule. Then less hydrogen evolution and anti-corrosion ability of zeolite-modified electrolyte by simulation and electrochemical characterizations are identified. Consequently, a zinc (Zn) anode involves less side-reaction, and develops into a compact deposition morphology, as proved by space-resolution characterizations. Moreover, zeolite-modified electrolyte favors cyclic life of symmetric Zn||Zn cells to 4765 h at 0.8&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, zinc-VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; coin cell to 3000 cycles, and pouch cell to 100 cycles. Finally, the mature production technique and low-cost of zeolite molecular sieve would tremendously favor the future scale-up application in engineering aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Selective Catalysis Remedies Polysulfide Shuttling in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective catalysis is proposed as a fundamental remedy for the consecutive solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid sulfur redox reactions. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept In&#8208;based catalyst targetedly decelerates the solid&#8208;liquid conversion, dissolution of elemental sulfur to polysulfides, while accelerates the liquid&#8208;solid conversion, deposition of polysulfides into insoluble Li2S, which basically reduces accumulation of polysulfides in electrolyte, finally inhibiting the shuttle effect in Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
The shuttling of soluble lithium polysulfides between the electrodes leads to serious capacity fading and excess use of electrolyte, which severely bottlenecks practical use of Li&#8208;S batteries. Here, selective catalysis is proposed as a fundamental remedy for the consecutive solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;solid sulfur redox reactions. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Indium (In)&#8208;based catalyst targetedly decelerates the solid&#8208;liquid conversion, dissolution of elemental sulfur to polysulfides, while accelerates the liquid&#8208;solid conversion, deposition of polysulfides into insoluble Li2S, which basically reduces accumulation of polysulfides in electrolyte, finally inhibiting the shuttle effect. The selective catalysis is revealed, experimentally and theoretically, by changes of activation energies and kinetic currents, modified reaction pathway together with the probed dynamically changing catalyst (LiInS2 catalyst), and gradual deactivation of the In&#8208;based catalyst. The In&#8208;based battery works steadily over 1000 cycles at 4.0 C and yields an initial areal capacity up to 9.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 with a sulfur loading of &#8776;9.0 mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Intracellular Dynamic Assembly of Deep&#8208;Red Emitting Supramolecular Nanostructures Based on the Pt&#8230;Pt Metallophilic Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of molecular platinum complexes are described that, in the presence of serum proteins, self&#8208;assemble via the metallophilic interaction. The resulting nanoaggregates are deep&#8208;red emissive; they cross the cell membranes by endocytosis, but instead of following the regular lysosome&#8208;assisted pathway, directly end up in the mitochondria.








Abstract
Many drug delivery systems end up in the lysosome because they are built from covalent or kinetically inert supramolecular bonds. To reach other organelles, nanoparticles hence need to either be made from a kinetically labile interaction that allows re&#8208;assembly of the nanoparticles inside the cell following endocytic uptake, or, be taken up by a mechanism that short&#8208;circuits the classical endocytosis pathway. In this work, the intracellular fate of nanorods that self&#8208;assemble via the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction of cyclometalated platinum(II) compounds, is studied. These deep&#8208;red emissive nanostructures (638&#160;nm excitation, &#8776;700&#160;nm emission) are stabilized by proteins in cell medium. Once in contact with cancer cells, they cross the cell membrane via dynamin&#8208; and clathrin&#8208;dependent endocytosis. However, time&#8208;dependent confocal colocalization and cellular electron microscopy demonstrate that they directly move to mitochondria without passing by the lysosomes. Altogether, this study suggests that Pt&#8230;Pt interaction is strong enough to generate emissive, aggregated nanoparticles inside cells, but labile enough to allow these nanostructures to reach the mitochondria without being trapped in the lysosomes. These findings open new venues to the development of bioimaging nanoplatforms based on the Pt&#8230;Pt interaction.

         <title>Frontiers in Theoretical Analysis of Solid Electrolyte Interphase Formation Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nature of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on battery electrodes governs the performance and safety of current and post Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, it has been unclear how reaction products of an electrolyte interact and aggregate to form the final SEI. This review highlights the morphological growth mechanism of the SEI, as revealed by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical simulation methodologies.








Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an ion conductive yet electron&#8208;insulating layer on battery electrodes, which is formed by the reductive decomposition of electrolytes during the initial charge. The nature of the SEI significantly impacts the safety, power, and lifetime of the batteries. Hence, elucidating the formation mechanism of the SEI layer has become a top priority. Conventional theoretical calculations reveal initial elementary steps of electrolyte reductive decomposition, whereas experimental approaches mainly focus on the characterization of the formed SEI in the final form. Moreover, both theoretical and experimental methodologies could not approach intermediate or transient steps of SEI growth. A major breakthrough has recently been achieved through a novel multiscale simulation method, which has enriched the understanding of how the reduction products are aggregated near the electrode and influence the SEI morphologies. This review highlights recent theoretical achievements to reveal the growth mechanism and provides a clear guideline for designing a stable SEI layer for advanced batteries.

         <title>Stabilizing Zinc Anodes by Regulating the Electrical Double Layer with Saccharin Anions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Saccharin is first introduced as an electrolyte additive for building a H2O&#8208;poor electrical double layer (EDL) structure near the Zn metal surface. With the presence of this unique EDL structure, Zn symmetric cells display a high cumulative plated capacity of 2.75 Ah cm&#8722;2 and a high average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.6% under harsh test conditions (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
Zn anodes suffer from poor Coulombic efficiency (CE) and serious dendrite formation due to the unstable anode/electrolyte interface (AEI). The electrical double layer (EDL) structure formed before cycling is of great significance for building stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn surface but barely discussed in previous research about the stabilization of Zn anode. Herein, saccharin (Sac) is introduced as electrolyte additive for regulating the EDL structure on the AEI. It is found that Sac derived anions are preferentially adsorbed on the Zn metal surface instead of water dipole, creating a new H2O&#8208;poor EDL structure. Moreover, the unique SEI is also detected on the Zn surface due to the decomposition of Sac anions. Both are proved to be capable of modulating Zn deposition behavior and preventing side reactions. Encouragingly, Zn|Zn symmetric cells using Sac additive deliver a high cumulative plated capacity of 2.75 Ah cm&#8722;2 and a high average CE of 99.6% under harsh test condition (10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 10 mAh cm&#8722;2). The excellent stability is also achieved at a high rate of 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The effectiveness of this Sac additive is further demonstrated in the Zn&#8208;MnO2 full cells.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different kinds of shape morphing are realized with programmable materials. Therefore, processing functions as well as if&#8208;then&#8208;else&#8208;conditions are implemented in unit cells. Local geometrical adaptions allow controlling the global shape in dependency of a load amplitude. Combining these elements, (strain&#8208;dependent) shapes as well as a moving hillock were&#160;created within a material.








Abstract
Shape morphing implicates that a specific condition leads to a morphing reaction. The material thus transforms from one shape to another in a predefined manner. In this paper, not only the target shape but rather the evolution of the material's shape as a function of the applied strain is programmed. To rationalize the design process, concepts from informatics (processing functions, for example, Poisson's ratio (PR) as function of strain: &#957;&#160;= f(&#949;) and if&#8208;then&#8208;else conditions) will be introduced. Three types of shape morphing behavior will be presented: (1) achieving a target shape by linearly increasing the amplitude of the shape, (2) filling up a target shape in linear steps, and (3) shifting a bulge through the material to a target position. In the first case, the shape is controlled by a geometric gradient within the material. The filling kind of behavior was&#160;implemented by logical operations. Moreover, programming moving hillocks (3) requires to implement a sinusoidal function &#949;y&#160;= sin&#8201;(&#949;x) and an if&#8208;then&#8208;else statement into the unit cells combined with a global stiffness gradient. The three cases will be used to show how the combination of mechanical mechanisms as well as the related parameter distribution enable a programmable shape morphing behavior in an inverse design&#160;process.

         <title>Antisolvent Engineering to Optimize Grain Crystallinity and Hole&#8208;Blocking Capability of Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi) is introduced via an antisolvent engineering to regulate the growth of perovskite film. Upon the incorporation of TPBi, the perovskite film obtains a higher crystallinity and enhanced hole blocking capability on the surface. The TPBi&#8208;incorporated perovskite solar cell delivers a high efficiency of 21.79% and keeps &#8776;92% of the initial value after 1000 h in the ambient atmosphere.








Abstract
With potential commercial applications, inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received wide&#8208;spread attentions as they are compatible with tandem devices and processed at low&#8208;temperature. Nevertheless, their efficiencies remain unsatisfactory due to insufficient film quality on hydrophobic hole transport layer and limited hole&#8208;blocking capability of the electron transport layer. Herein, 1,3,5&#8208;Tris(1&#8208;phenyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)benzene (TPBi), an n&#8208;type semiconductor, is incorporated into the antisolvent to simultaneously regulate the grain growth and charge transport of perovskite films. TPBi facilitates the crystallization of perovskites along (100) orientation. Besides, TPBi is mainly distributed near the top surface of perovskite film and enhances the hole&#8208;blocking capability of the area adjacent to the surface. The superior properties of this film lead to a remarkable improvement in the open&#8208;circuit voltage of inverted PSCs. The champion device achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 21.79% while keeping &#8776;92% of its initial value after 1000 h storage in the ambient atmosphere. This work provides an effective way to evidently promote the performance of inverted PSCs and illustrates its underlaying mechanism.

         <title>Identification of the Key Parameters for Horizontal Transition Dipole Orientation in Fluorescent and TADF Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Horizontal emitter orientation can significantly increase the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. Intense research over the past decade has provided a large amount of data on the factors that may drive horizontal orientation of organic emitters. This research is reviewed, and a meta&#8208;analysis of the data is combined with quantum&#8208;chemical calculations to identify key parameters that influence this orientation.








Abstract
In organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), horizontal orientation of the emissive transition dipole moment (TDM) can improve light outcoupling efficiency by up to 50% relative to random orientation. Therefore, there have been extensive efforts to identify drivers of horizontal orientation. The aspect ratio of the emitter molecule and the glass&#8208;transition temperature (Tg) of the films are currently regarded as particularly important. However, there remains a paucity of systematic studies that establish the extent to which these and other parameters control orientation in the wide range of emitter systems relevant for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OLEDs. Here, recent work on molecular orientation of fluorescent and thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters in vacuum&#8208;processed OLEDs is reviewed. Additionally, to identify parameters linked to TDM orientation, a meta&#8208;analysis of 203 published emitter systems is conducted and combined with density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Molecular weight (MW) and linearity are identified as key parameters in neat systems. In host&#8211;guest systems with low&#8208;MW emitters, orientation is mostly influenced by the host Tg, whereas the length and MW of the emitter become more relevant for systems involving higher&#8208;MW emitters. To close, a perspective of where the field must advance to establish a comprehensive model of molecular orientation is given.

         <title>Regioregular Narrow&#8208;Bandgap n&#8208;Type Polymers with High Electron Mobility Enabling Highly Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap n&#8208;type polymer, L15, is synthesized, showing higher electron mobility and larger absorption coefficient compared to its random analog. When applied as an electron acceptor in all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs), L15 yields outstanding efficiencies of 15.2% and 16.2% in binary and ternary all&#8208;PSCs, respectively.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap n&#8208;type polymers with high electron mobility are urgently demanded for the development of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, two regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors, L15 and MBTI, with two electron&#8208;deficient segments are synthesized by copolymerizing two dibrominated fused&#8208;ring electron acceptors (FREA) with distannylated aromatic imide, respectively. Taking full advantage of the FREA and the imide, both polymer acceptors show narrow bandgap and high electron mobility. Benefiting from the more extended absorption, better backbone ordering, and higher electron mobility than those of its regiorandom analog, the L15&#8208;based all&#8208;PSC yields a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.2% when blended with the polymer donor PM6. More importantly, MBTI incorporating a benzothiophene&#8208;core FREA segment shows relatively higher frontier molecular orbital levels than L15, forming a cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment with L15 and PM6. Based on this, ternary all&#8208;PSCs are designed where MBTI is introduced as a guest into the PM6:L15 host system. Thanks to further optimal blend morphology and more balanced charge transport, the PCE is improved up to 16.2%, which is among the highest values for all&#8208;PSCs. The results demonstrate that combining an FREA and an aromatic imide to construct regioregular narrow&#8208;bandgap polymer acceptors provides an effective approach to fabricate highly efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Modulation of Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance in Ultrathin Hexagonal Gold Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monochromated electron energy&#8208;loss spectral maps reveal four distinct localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) components and intensity distributions of all LSPR modes in a hexagonal gold nanoplate (NPL). Strain maps provide experimental evidence that the tensile strain field induced by a Z&#8208;shaped faulted dipole is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of the LSPR intensity in a hexagonal gold NPL.








Abstract
Anisotropic gold nanoplates (NPLs) have raised the interesting possibility that their reduced geometrical symmetry allows fine tuning of their optical properties associated with the excitation of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs). Recent developments have greatly improved LSPR tunability by utilizing the spatial distribution of LSPR modes. However, the nanoscale interplay between defect&#8208;induced mechanical strain and the spatial variation of LSPR modes remains poorly understood. In this work, the combination of high spatial&#8208; and spectral&#8208;resolution mapping of LSPR modes and nanoscale strain mapping using aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy are applied to investigate the nanoscale distribution of LSPR modes in an ultrathin single hexagonal gold NPL and the effect of defect&#8208;induced strains on its LSPR properties. The electron energy&#8208;loss spectral maps reveal four distinct LSPR components and intensity distributions of all LSPR modes in a hexagonal gold NPL. Furthermore, the strain maps provide experimental evidence that the tensile strain field induced by a Z&#8208;shaped faulted dipole is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of LSPR intensity in a hexagonal gold NPL.

The electron energy-loss spectral maps reveal four distinct LSPR components and intensity distributions of all LSPR modes in a hexagonal gold NPL. Furthermore, the strain maps provide experimental evidence that the tensile strain field induced by a Z-shaped faulted dipole is responsible for the asymmetric distribution of LSPR intensity in a hexagonal gold NPL.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Controllable Heterojunctions with a Semicoherent Phase Boundary Boosting the Potassium Storage of CoSe2/FeSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the crystal orientation allows an effective way to control the electrical properties of a heterojunction. By engineering the hetero&#8208;interfaces, rich vacancies and ultrafine CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunctions with semicoherent phase boundary are simultaneously obtained. The smart design not only modifies the electronic structure but also boosts the K+ diffusion.








Abstract
Heterostructure construction is an efficient method for reinforcing K+ storage of transition metal selenides. The spontaneously developed internal electric fields give a strong boost to charge transport and significantly reduce the activation energy. Nevertheless, perfection of the interfacial region based on the energy level gradient and lattice matching degree is still a great challenge. Herein, rich vacancies and ultrafine CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunctions with semicoherent phase boundary are simultaneously obtained, which possess unique electronic structures and abundant active sites. When employed as anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs), CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2@C composites display a reversible potassium storage of 401.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1 and even 275 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1. Theoretical calculation also reveals that the potassium&#8208;ion diffusion can be dramatically promoted by the controllable CoSe2&#8211;FeSe2 heterojunction.

         <title>Ambipolar Channel p&#8208;TMD/n&#8208;Ga2O3 Junction Field Effect Transistors and High Speed Photo&#8208;sensing in TMD Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline 2D/3D&#8208;mixed p&#8208;TMD/n&#8208;Ga2O3 heterojunction devices are fabricated by mechanical exfoliation of each p&#8208; and n&#8208;type material, to finally realize ambipolar channel junction field effect transistors (JFETs) as well as PN diode. For more extended applications, p&#8208;TMD channel JFETs are used to sense visible or NIR photons through the &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 at high speed.








Abstract
Highly crystalline 2D/3D&#8208;mixed p&#8208;transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD)/n&#8208;Ga2O3 heterojunction devices are fabricated by mechanical exfoliation of each p&#8208; and n&#8208;type material. N&#8208;type &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 and p&#8208;type TMD separately play as a channel for junction field effect transistors (JFETs) with each type of carriers as well as materials for a heterojunction PN diode. The work thus mainly focuses on such ambipolar channel transistors with two different types of channel in a single device architecture. For more extended applications, the transparency of high energy band gap &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 (Eg&#160;&#8776; 4.8&#160;eV) is taken advantage of, firstly to measure the electrical energy gap of p&#8208;TMDs receiving visible or near infrared (NIR) photons through the &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3. Next, the p&#8208;TMD/n&#8208;Ga2O3 JFETs are put to high speed photo&#8208;sensing which is achieved from the p&#8208;TMD channel under reverse bias voltages on n&#8208;Ga2O3. The photo&#8208;switching cutoff frequency appears to be &#8776;16 and 29&#160;kHz for visible red and NIR illuminations, respectively, on the basis of &#8722;3&#160;dB photoelectric power loss. Such a high switching speed of the JFET is attributed to the fast transport of photo&#8208;carriers in TMD channels. The 2D/3D&#8208;mixed ambipolar channel JFETs and their photo&#8208;sensing applications are regarded novel, promising, and practically easy to achieve.

         <title>A First Wide&#8208;Open LDH Structure Hosting InP/ZnS QDs: A New Route Toward Efficient and Photostable Red&#8208;Emitting Phosphor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
InP/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) embedded into bola&#8208;layered double hydroxides (LDH) host structure exhibit photoluminescence properties surpassing those of pristine QDs powder. Incorporated into silicone, this new hybrid phosphor results in a homogeneous and highly&#8208;saturated red&#8208;emitting film with good photonic stability, suitable for high&#8208; color rendering index (CRI) LED lighting.








Abstract
The architecture of Zn&#8208;Al layered double hydroxides (LDHs), organo&#8208;modified with bola&#8208;amphiphiles molecules, is matching its interlayer space to the size of narrow&#8208;band red&#8208;emitting InP/ZnS core&#8211;shell quantum dots (QDs) to form original high&#8208;performance functional organic&#8211;inorganic QD&#8208;bola&#8208;LDH hybrids. The success of size&#8208;matching interlayer space (SMIS) approach is confirmed by X&#8208;ray diffraction, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering (SAXS), TEM, STEM&#8208;HAADF, and photoluminescence investigations. The QD&#8208;Bola&#8208;LDH hybrid exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield three times higher than that of pristine InP/ZnS QDs and provides an easy dispersion into silicone&#8208;based resins, what makes the SMIS approach a change of paradigm compared to intercalation chemistry using common host structures. Moreover, this novel hybrid presents low QD&#8211;QD energy transfer comparable to that obtained for QDs in suspension. Composite silicone films incorporating InP/ZnS (0.27&#160;wt%) QD&#8208;bola&#8208;LDH hybrids further show remarkable improved photostability relative to pristine QDs. An LED overlay consisting of a blue LED chip and silicone films loaded with QD&#8208;bola&#8208;LDH hybrids and YAG:Ce phosphors exhibits a color rendering index close to 94.

         <title>Domino Reaction Encoded Heterogeneous Colloidal Microswarm with On&#8208;Demand Morphological Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a biomimetic colloidal swarm system that can synchronously traverse complex environments through adaptive transformation and perform multitasks with domino reaction&#8208;enhanced efficiency through specialization and cooperation between building blocks, thus contributing to the development of multifunctional microswarm and the applications of micro/nanorobots for targeted therapy.








Abstract
Emulating natural swarm intelligence with group&#8208;level functionality in artificial micro/nanorobotic systems offers an opportunity to sublimate the limited functions of individuals and revolutionize their applications. However, achieving synchronous operation of microswarms with environmental adaptability and cooperative tasking capability remains a challenge. Here, an adaptive and heterogeneous colloidal magnetic microswarm with domino reaction encoded cooperative functions is presented. Through programming external magnetic fields, the system self&#8208;organizes into two swarm states, that is, vortex and ribbon microswarms, which can switch between each other reversibly within seconds, allowing to traverse tortuous, branched, and confined environments through adaptive morphological transformation. By specializing subgroups of building blocks with separate functions, cooperative tasking capability is integrated into the heterogeneous system following a &#8220;division of labor&#8221; manner. Given targeted therapy as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept task, the coordinated delivery of heterogeneous colloidal system across a complex environment with an access rate higher than 90% is demonstrated, and the specialization and cooperation between building blocks to disrupt multiple growth pathways of cancer cells via domino reaction are realized. The reconfigurable microswarm with hierarchical functionality presents a bioinspired approach to adapt to environmental variations and address multitasking requirements, which advances the development of microrobotic swarms and promises major benefits in biomedical fields.

         <title>Cutaneous Ionogel Mechanoreceptors for Soft Machines, Physiological Sensing, and Amputee Prostheses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly sensitive and robust cutaneous ionogel mechanoreceptor is proposed through facile manufacturing methods. The hydrogel&#8208;based hierarchical architecture harnesses ultracapacitive mechanism to achieve enhanced pressure sensing functionality with high bandwidth and sensitivity. This scalable touch skin can provide tactile sensing for soft machines, physiological signal monitoring, industrial robots, and amputee prostheses.








Abstract
Touch sensing has a central role in robotic grasping and emerging human&#8211;machine interfaces for robot&#8208;assisted prosthetics. Although advancements in soft conductive polymers have promoted the creation of diverse pressure sensors, these sensors are difficult to be employed as touch skins for robotics and prostheses due to their limited sensitivity, narrow pressure range, and complex structure and fabrication process. Here, a highly sensitive and robust soft touch skin is presented with ultracapacitive sensing that combines ionic hydrogels with commercially available conductive fabrics. Prototypical designs of the capacitive sensors through facile manufacturing methods are introduced and a high sensitivity up to 1.5 kPa&#8722;1 (&#8776;44 times higher than conventional parallel&#8208;plate capacitive counterparts), a broad pressure detection range of over four orders of magnitudes (&#8776;35&#160;Pa to 330&#160;kPa), ultrahigh baseline of capacitance, fast response time (&#8776;18&#160;ms), and good repeatability are demonstrated. Ionogel skins composed of an array of cutaneous mechanoreceptors capable of monitoring various physiological signals and shape detection are further developed. The touch skin can be integrated within a soft bionic hand and provide an industrial robot and an amputee with robust tactile feedback when handling delicate objects, illustrating its potential applications in next&#8208;generation human&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop robotic systems with tactile sensing.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Structure of Supercooled Liquid Gallium and Eutectic Gallium&#8211;Indium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The existence of liquid crystal (LC) mesophase in metallic materials is counterintuitive. Typical LCs are made of covalently bonded organic molecules. This study reports on the observation of LC mesophases in supercooled liquid gallium and eutectic gallium&#8211;indium alloy. LC texture of the lamellar structure similar to that of the smectic phase is unveiled at room temperature.








Abstract
Understanding the origin of structural ordering in supercooled liquid gallium (Ga) has been a great scientific quest in the past decades. Here, reflective polarized optical microscopy on Ga sandwiched between glasses treated with rubbed polymers reveals the onset of an anisotropic reflection at 120&#160;&#176;C that increases on cooling and persists down to room temperature or below. The polymer rubbing usually aligns the director of thermotropic liquid crystals (LCs) parallel to the rubbing direction. On the other hand, when Ga is sandwiched between substrates that align conventional LC molecules normal to the surface, the reflection is isotropic, but mechanical shear force induces anisotropic reflection that relaxes in seconds. Such alignment effects and shear&#8208;induced realignment are typical to conventional thermotropic LCs and indicate a LC structure of liquid Ga. Specifically, Ga textures obtained by atomic force and scanning electron microscopy reveal the existence of a lamellar structure corresponding to a smectic LC phase, while the nanometer&#8208;thin lamellar structure is transparent under transmission polarized optical microscopy. Such spatial molecular arrangements may be attributed to dimer molecular entities in the supercooled liquid Ga. The LC structure observation of electrically conductive liquid Ga can provide new opportunities in materials science and LC applications.

         <title>Increasing Accessible Subsurface to Improving Rate Capability and Cycling Stability of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroatom doping affects the interlayer spacing of subsurface region much more than bulk for carbonaceous nanoparticles. The increased accessible subsurface boosts the pseudocapacitive capacity and endows SRNDC&#8208;700 with excellent rate performance up to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This varies from diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity determinism and provides a novel design concept for doping carbonaceous material.








Abstract
Numerous studies have reported that the enhancement of rate capability of carbonaceous anode by heteroatom doping is due to the increased diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity induced by expanding interlayer spacing. However, percentage of diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity is less than 30% as scan rate is larger than 1&#160;mV s&#8722;1, suggesting there is inaccuracy in recognizing principle of improving rate capability of carbonaceous anode. In this paper, it is found that the heteroatom doping has little impact on interlayer spacing of carbon in bulk phase, meaning that diffusion&#8208;controlled capacity is hard to be enhanced by doping. After synergizing with tensile stress, however, the interlayer spacing in subsurface region is obviously expanded to 0.40&#160;nm, which will increase the thickness of accessible subsurface region at high current density. So SRNDC&#8208;700 electrodes display a high specific capacity of 160.6 and 69.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 and 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, respectively. Additionally, the high reversibility of carbon structure insures ultralong cycling stability and hence attenuation of SRNDC&#8208;700 is only 0.0025% per cycle even at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 for 6000 cycles. This report sheds new insight into mechanism of improving electrochemical performance of carbonaceous anode by doping and provides a novel design concept for doping carbon.

         <title>Engineering the Dynamics of Cell Adhesion Cues in Supramolecular Hydrogels for Facile Control over Cell Encapsulation and Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slow and fast exchanging molecules are co&#8208;assembled into transient fibrous networks, forming supramolecular hydrogels. Modulating the ratio between these molecules can dictate the extent of dynamic behavior of the hydrogels and incorporated bioactive cues. The dynamic character of supramolecular building blocks and the tunability of this system are exploited for facile encapsulation of cellular components and control over their behavior.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix (ECM) forms through hierarchical assembly of small and larger polymeric molecules into a transient, hydrogel&#8208;like fibrous network that provides mechanical support and biochemical cues to cells. Synthetic, fibrous supramolecular networks formed via non&#8208;covalent assembly of various molecules are therefore potential candidates as synthetic mimics of the natural ECM, provided that functionalization with biochemical cues is effective. Here, combinations of slow and fast exchanging molecules that self&#8208;assemble into supramolecular fibers are employed to form transient hydrogel networks with tunable dynamic behavior. Obtained results prove that modulating the ratio between these molecules dictates the extent of dynamic behavior of the hydrogels at both the molecular and the network level, which is proposed to enable effective incorporation of cell&#8208;adhesive functionalities in these materials. Excitingly, the dynamic nature of the supramolecular components in this system can be conveniently employed to formulate multicomponent supramolecular hydrogels for easy culturing and encapsulation of single cells, spheroids, and organoids. Importantly, these findings highlight the significance of molecular design and exchange dynamics for the application of supramolecular hydrogels as synthetic ECM mimics.

         <title>Ultrastrong and Ductile Soft Magnetic High&#8208;Entropy Alloys via Coherent Ordered Nanoprecipitates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastrong and ductile bulk high&#8208;entropy alloys with excellent soft magnetic properties are achieved by introducing a high volume fraction of coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates into the alloy matrix. The high lattice coherency between the homogeneously dispersed nanoprecipitates and the alloy matrix creates only negligible distortion fields on magnetic domain wall motion and contributes significantly to the strength of the material.








Abstract
The lack of strength and damage tolerance can limit the applications of conventional soft magnetic materials (SMMs), particularly in mechanically loaded functional devices. Therefore, strengthening and toughening of SMMs is critically important. However, conventional strengthening concepts usually significantly deteriorate soft magnetic properties, due to Bloch wall interactions with the defects used for hardening. Here a novel concept to overcome this dilemma is proposed, by developing bulk SMMs with excellent mechanical and attractive soft magnetic properties through coherent and ordered nanoprecipitates (&lt;15&#160;nm) dispersed homogeneously within a face&#8208;centered cubic matrix of a non&#8208;equiatomic CoFeNiTaAl high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA). Compared to the alloy in precipitate&#8208;free state, the alloy variant with a large volume fraction (&gt;42%) of nanoprecipitates achieves significantly enhanced strength (&#8776;1526&#160;MPa) at good ductility (&#8776;15%), while the coercivity is only marginally increased (&lt;10.7&#160;Oe). The ordered nanoprecipitates and the resulting dynamic microband refinement in the matrix significantly strengthen the HEAs, while full coherency between the nanoprecipitates and the matrix leads at the same time to the desired insignificant pinning of the magnetic domain walls. The findings provide guidance for developing new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and soft magnetic properties as needed for the electrification of transport and industry.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired materials have technical advantages in application as major components of secondary batteries as well as environmental and economic advantages. The recent research progress on utilization of biomaterials for electrodes, separators, and binders for the improvement of the performance of rechargeable batteries are highlighted and summarized. Current challenges and perspectives regarding the use of biomaterials for secondary batteries are given.








Abstract
Materials in nature have evolved to the most efficient forms and have adapted to various environmental conditions over tens of thousands of years. Because of their versatile functionalities and environmental friendliness, numerous attempts have been made to use bio&#8208;inspired materials for industrial applications, establishing the importance of biomimetics. Biomimetics have become pivotal to the search for technological breakthroughs in the area of rechargeable secondary batteries. Here, the characteristics of bio&#8208;inspired materials that are useful for secondary batteries as well as their benefits for application as the main components of batteries (e.g., electrodes, separators, and binders) are discussed. The use of bio&#8208;inspired materials for the synthesis of nanomaterials with complex structures, low&#8208;cost electrode materials prepared from biomass, and biomolecular organic electrodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries are also introduced. In addition, nature&#8208;derived separators and binders are discussed, including their effects on enhancing battery performance and safety. Recent developments toward next&#8208;generation secondary batteries including sodium&#8208;ion batteries, zinc&#8208;ion batteries, and flexible batteries are also mentioned to understand the feasibility of using bio&#8208;inspired materials in these new battery systems. Finally, current research trends are covered and future directions are proposed to provide important insights into scientific and practical issues in the development of biomimetics technologies for secondary batteries.

         <title>A Universal Strategy toward the Precise Regulation of Initial Coulombic Efficiency of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced cation/anion double defects can reduce the interface charge transfer resistance and enhance the Li+ ions diffusion coefficient. The induced in situ surface reconstruction layer can increase the electronic conductivity and stabilize the surface lattice oxygen. As a result, the initial Coulombic efficiency of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode material is controlled precisely.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based cathode materials (LRMs) are potential cathode materials for high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) severely hinders the commercialization of LRM. Herein, a facile oleic acid&#8208;assisted interface engineering is put forward to precisely control the ICE, enhance reversible capacity and rate performance of LRM effectively. As a result, the ICE of LRM can be precisely adjusted from 84.1% to 100.7%, and a very high specific capacity of 330 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, as well as outstanding rate capability with a fascinating specific capacity of 250 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C, are harvested. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduced cation/anion double defects can reduce the diffusion barrier of Li+ ions, and in situ surface reconstruction layer can induce a self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field to stabilize the surface lattice oxygen. Moreover, this facile interface engineering is universal and can enhance the ICEs of other kinds of LRM effectively. This work provides a valuable new idea for improving the comprehensive electrochemical performance of LRM through multistrategy collaborative interface engineering technology.

         <title>3D Laser Displays Based on Circularly Polarized Lasing from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated on cholesteric liquid crystal arrays, which comprise two sets of red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) pixels to present two images with orthogonal circularly polarized laser emissions. Stereoscopic images can be generated in a viewer's mind by fusing the two images acquired by the left and right eyes, respectively.








Abstract
3D laser displays play an important role in next&#8208;generation display technologies owing to the ultimate visual experience they provide. Circularly polarized (CP) laser emissions, featuring optical rotatory power and invariability under rotations, are attractive for 3D displays due to potential in enhancing contrast ratio and comfortability. However, the lack of pixelated self&#8208;emissive CP microlaser arrays as display panels hinders the implementation of 3D laser displays. Here, full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated based on CP lasing with inkjet&#8208;printed cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) arrays as display panels. Individual CP lasers are realized by embedding fluorescent dyes into CLCs with their left&#8208;/right&#8208;handed helical superstructures serving as distributed feedback microcavities, bringing in ultrahigh circular polarization degree values (gem&#160;= 1.6). These CP microlaser pixels exhibit excellent far&#8208;field color&#8208;rendering features and a relatively large color gamut for high&#8208;fidelity displays. With these printed CLC red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) microlaser arrays serving as display panels, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept full&#8208;color 3D laser displays are demonstrated via delivering images with orthogonal CP laser emissions into one's left and right eyes. These results provide valuable enlightenment for the development of 3D laser displays.

         <title>High Resolution Patterning of an Organic&#8211;Inorganic Photoresin for the Fabrication of Platinum Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High resolution patterning of an organic&#8211;inorganic platinum containing photoresin by microlithography and two&#8208;photon&#8208;polymerization is demonstrated. The polymerized microstructures are debinded and reduced to highly conductive metallic platinum at a resolution of 300&#160;nm. The conductivity of the reduced platinum structures is 67% of the conductivity of bulk platinum.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) is an interesting material for many applications due to its high chemical resilience, outstanding catalytic activity, high electrical conductivity, and high melting point. However, microstructuring and especially 3D microstructuring of platinum is a complex process, based on expensive and specialized equipment often suffering from very slow processing speeds. In this work, organic&#8211;inorganic photoresins, which can be structured using direct optical lithography as well as two&#8208;photon lithography (TPL) with submicrometer resolution and high&#8208;throughput is presented. The printed structures are subsequently converted to high&#8208;purity platinum using thermal debinding of the binder and reduction of the salt. With this technique, complex 3D structures with a 3D resolution of 300&#160;nm were&#160;fabricated. At a layer thickness of 35&#160;nm, the patterns reach a high conductivity of 67% compared to bulk platinum. Microheaters, thermocouple sensors as well as a Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip system are presented as exemplary applications. This technology will enable a broad range of application from electronics, sensing and heating elements to 3D photonics and metamaterials.

         <title>Double&#8208; to Single&#8208;Strand Transition Induces Forces and Motion in DNA Origami Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designed pulling mechanism making use of the entropic spring behavior of single&#8208;stranded DNA is presented. Controlled and reversible motion of two arms of a nanoscale DNA origami structure is shown, resembling the arms of a jumping jack. The opening and closing of the arms are monitored with transmission electron microscopy, super&#8208;resolution microscopy, and darkfield analysis.








Abstract
The design of dynamic, reconfigurable devices is crucial for the bottom&#8208;up construction of artificial biological systems. DNA can be used as an engineering material for the de&#8208;novo design of such dynamic devices. A self&#8208;assembled DNA origami switch is presented that uses the transition from double&#8208; to single&#8208;stranded DNA and vice versa to create and annihilate an entropic force that drives a reversible conformational change inside the switch. It is distinctively demonstrated that a DNA single&#8208;strand that is extended with 0.34&#160;nm per nucleotide &#8211; the extension this very strand has in the double&#8208;stranded configuration &#8211; exerts a contractive force on its ends leading to large&#8208;scale motion. The operation of this type of switch is demonstrated via transmission electron microscopy, DNA&#8208;PAINT super&#8208;resolution microscopy and darkfield microscopy. The work illustrates the intricate and sometimes counter&#8208;intuitive forces that act in nanoscale physical systems that operate in fluids.

         <title>Ultrathin Multibridge Channel Transistor Enabled by van der Waals Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D ultrathin multibridge channel field&#8208;effect transistor (MBCFET), constructed based on 2&#160;nm/2&#160;nm MoS2 channels is demonstrated. This two&#8208;level&#8208;stacked MBCFET exhibits an on&#8211;off current ratio of up to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;108 with a theoretical minimum subthreshold swing value (60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1) at room temperature.








Abstract
Multibridge channel field&#8208;effect transistors (MBCFETs) enable improved gate control and flow of a large drive current and they are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation transistor architecture. However, in achieving a larger drive current with a thinner channel, limitations arise from the decrease in mobility when the thickness of the Si nanosheet is less than 5&#160;nm. In addition, an increase in the leakage current is unavoidable when a large number of channels are stacked. Here, a 2D ultrathin MBCFET is demonstrate, constructed based on 2&#160;nm/2&#160;nm MoS2 channels. The normalized drive current (23.11 &#181;A*&#181;m&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1) in each level channel of this MBCFET exceeds that of the latest seven&#8208;level&#8208;stacked Si MBCFET, while the leakage current is only 0.4% of this value, with the subthreshold swing reaching 60&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio reaching up to 4&#160;&#215;&#160;108 at room temperature. Furthermore, the drive current of this 2D ultrathin MBCFET can be further increased by regulating the polarity of the operation voltage to reduce the injection barrier. The combination of 2D materials and an MBC structure has the potential for use in high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption electronics.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Anisotropic Janus Silicon Quantum Dots via Masking on 2D Silicon Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;faced &#8220;Janus&#8221; silicon quantum dots (QDs) are synthesized by using silicon nanosheets as a sacrificial mask. The method exploits the photosensitivity of the mask and the photoreactivity of the QDs to introduce two different functional groups on either side. The characteristic optoelectronic properties remain unaffected while the two&#8208;sided nature imparts new unique properties such as self&#8208;assembly and monolayer formation.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;anisotropic nanoparticles represent a new class of materials that shows potential in a variety of applications, including self&#8208;assembly, microelectronics, and biology. Here, the first synthesis of surface&#8208;anisotropic silicon quantum dots (SiQDs), obtained through masking on 2D silicon nanosheets, is presented. SiQDs are deposited on the 2D substrate, thereby exposing only one side of the QDs, which is functionalized through well&#8208;established hydrosilylation procedures. The UV&#8208;sensitive masking substrate is removed through UV&#8208;irradiation, which simultaneously initiates the hydrosilylation of a second substrate, thereby introducing a second functional group to the other side of the now free&#8208;standing SiQDs. This renders surface&#8208;anisotropic SiQDs that have two different functional groups on either side of the particle. This method can be used to introduce a variety of functional groups including hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates, while the unique optoelectronic properties of the SiQDs remain unaffected. The anisotropic morphology of the QDs is confirmed through the aggregation behavior of amphiphilic Janus SiQDs at the interface of water and hexane. Additionally, anisotropic SiQDs are used to produce the first controlled (sub)monolayer of SiQDs on a gold wafer.

         <title>Metamorphosis of Heterostructured Surface&#8208;Mounted Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Yielding Record Oxygen Evolution Mass Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is developed to prepare highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts by the in situ structural transformation and self&#8208;activation of heterostructured surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs). This work enables access to a parameter space of metal&#8208;oxyhydroxide&#8208;type catalyst fabrication through the structural metamorphosis of SURMOFs.








Abstract
Materials derived from surface&#8208;mounted metal&#8211;organic frameworks (SURMOFs) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). A series of mixed&#8208;metal, heterostructured SURMOFs is fabricated by the facile layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition method. The obtained materials reveal record&#8208;high electrocatalyst mass activities of &#8776;2.90 kA g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 300&#160;mV in 0.1 m KOH, superior to the benchmarking precious and nonprecious metal electrocatalysts. This property is assigned to the particular in situ self&#8208;reconstruction and self&#8208;activation of the SURMOFs during the immersion and the electrochemical treatment in alkaline aqueous electrolytes, which allows for the generation of NiFe (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst materials of specific morphology and microstructure.

         <title>Crystallization by Amorphous Particle Attachment: On the Evolution of Texture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown that biogenic minerals not only provide key in&#8208;sight into material morphogenesis during crystallization by amorphous particle attachment but also teach us fundamental new mechanisms that have a profound effect on textural evolution during non&#8208;classical crystal growth. A link between the emergence of texture and amorphous particle accretion rate is established.








Abstract
Crystallization by particle attachment (CPA) is a gradual process where each step has its own thermodynamic and kinetic constrains defining a unique pathway of crystal growth. An important example is biomineralization of calcium carbonate through amorphous precursors that are morphed into shapes and textural patterns that cannot be envisioned by the classical monomer&#8208;by&#8208;monomer approach. Here, a mechanistic link between the collective kinetics of mineral deposition and the emergence of crystallographic texture is established. Using the prismatic ultrastructure in bivalve shells as a model, a fundamental leap is made in the ability to analytically describe the evolution of form and texture of biological mineralized tissues and to design the structure and crystallographic properties of synthetic materials formed by CPA.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Organic Chiral Nematic Materials with Adaptive Light Emission and On&#8208;Demand Handedness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust and flexible chiral emissive bio&#8208;nanocomposite with chiral nematic&#8208;like organization that mimic biological photonic mesostructure observed in nature are demonstrated. Small molecules built in chiral mesostructure are assembled along helical arrangement, allowing to generate strong active circularly polarized light emission. Real&#8208;time phase transition of the molecules integrated into biophotonic structure enables highly asymmetric circularly polarized light emission with on&#8208;demand handedness.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time active control of the handedness of circularly polarized light emission requires sophisticated manufacturing and structural reconfigurations of inorganic optical components that can rarely be achieved in traditional passive optical structures. Here, robust and flexible emissive optically&#8208;doped biophotonic materials that facilitate the dynamic optical activity are reported. These optically active bio&#8208;enabled materials with a chiral nematic&#8208;like organization of cellulose nanocrystals with intercalated organic dye generated strong circularly polarized photoluminescence with a high asymmetric factor. Reversible phase&#8208;shifting of the photochromic molecules intercalated into chiral nematic organization enables alternating circularly polarized light emission with on&#8208;demand handedness. Real&#8208;time alternating handedness can be triggered by either remote light illumination or changes in the acidic environment. This unique dynamic chiro&#8208;optical behavior presents an efficient way to design emissive bio&#8208;derived materials for dynamic programmable active photonic materials for optical communication, optical coding, visual protection, and visual adaptation.

         <title>In Situ Chemical Lithiation Transforms Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon into an Ultrastrong Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator suppresses Li&#8208;dendrite growth and redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition, which results in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at 3.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with a cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li)&#8208;metal anodes are of great promise for next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high theoretical capacity and low redox potential. However, Li&#8208;dendrite growth during cycling imposes a tremendous safety concern on the practical application of Li&#8208;metal anodes. Herein, an effective approach to suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by coating a polypropylene (PP) separator with a thin layer of ultrastrong diamond&#8208;like carbon (DLC) is reported. Theoretical calculations indicate that the DLC coating layer undergoes in situ chemical lithiation once assembled with the lithium&#8208;metal anode, transforming the DLC/PP separator into an excellent 3D Li&#8208;ion conductor. This in situ lithiated DLC/PP separator can not only mechanically suppress Li&#8208;dendrite growth by its intrinsically high modulus (&#8776;100&#160;GPa), but also uniformly redistributes Li ions to render dendrite&#8208;free lithium deposition. The twofold effects of the DLC/PP separator result in stable cycling of lithium plating/stripping (over 4500 h) at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, this approach enables more than 1000 stable cycles at 5 C with a capacity retention of &#8776;71% in a Li || LiFePO4 coin cell and more than 200 stable cycles at 0.2 C in a Li || LiNi0.5Co0.3Mn0.2O2 pouch cell with cathode mass loading of &#8776;9&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Simultaneous Manipulation of Bulk Excitons and Surface Defects for Ultrastable and Highly Selective CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inventive molten strategy is used to synthesize homogeneously B&#8208;doped BiOCl nanosheets. Bulk B mitigates the strong excitonic effect confined in 2D BiOCl, whereas surface B induces a reactive B&#8208;OV associate for CO2 activation. The simultaneous tailoring bulk excitons and surface defects enable ultrastable and highly selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction in pure water.








Abstract
The objective of photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) is to achieve high selectivity for a single energy&#8208;bearing product with high efficiency and stability. The bulk configuration usually determines charge carrier kinetics, whereas surface atomic arrangement defines the PCR thermodynamic pathway. Concurrent engineering of bulk and surface structures is therefore crucial for achieving the goal of PCR. Herein, an ultrastable and highly selective PCR using homogeneously doped BiOCl nanosheets synthesized via an inventive molten strategy is presented. With B2O3 as both the molten salt and doping precursor, this new doping approach ensures boron (B) doping from the surface into the bulk with dual functionalities. Bulk B doping mitigates strong excitonic effects confined in 2D BiOCl by significantly reducing exciton binding energies, whereas surface&#8208;doped B atoms reconstruct the BiOCl surface by extracting lattice hydroxyl groups, resulting in intimate B&#8208;oxygen vacancy (B&#8208;OV) associates. These exclusive B&#8208;OV associates enable spontaneous CO2 activation, suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and promote the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer step by stabilizing *COOH for selective CO generation. As a result, the homogeneous B&#8208;doped BiOCl nanosheets exhibit 98% selectivity for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO reduction under visible light, with an impressive rate of 83.64&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and ultrastability for long&#8208;term testing of 120 h.

         <title>Highly Efficient Uniaxial In&#8208;Plane Stretching of a 2D Material via Ion Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ion insertion in between the 2D layers of WTe2 is shown to induce an exotic crystallographic phase. This novel phase is linked to uniquely large uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain. On&#8208;chip electrochemical control over the lithium content in single flakes of WTe2 is demonstrated as an efficient, fast, and reversible way to control the strain, making LixWTe2 a promising microscale actuator.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip dynamic strain engineering requires efficient micro&#8208;actuators that can generate large in&#8208;plane strains. Inorganic electrochemical actuators are unique in that they are driven by low voltages (&#8776;1&#160;V) and produce considerable strains (&#8776;1%). However, actuation speed and efficiency are limited by mass transport of ions. Minimizing the number of ions required to actuate is thus key to enabling useful &#8220;straintronic&#8221; devices. Here, it is shown that the electrochemical intercalation of exceptionally few lithium ions into WTe2 causes large anisotropic in&#8208;plane strain: 5% in one in&#8208;plane direction and 0.1% in the other. This efficient stretching of the 2D WTe2 layers contrasts to intercalation&#8208;induced strains in related materials which are predominantly in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. The unusual actuation of LixWTe2 is linked to the formation of a newly discovered crystallographic phase, referred to as Td', with an exotic atomic arrangement. On&#8208;chip low&#8208;voltage (&lt;0.2&#160;V) control is demonstrated over the transition to the novel phase and its composition. Within the Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 phase, a uniaxial in&#8208;plane strain of 1.4% is achieved with a change of &#948; of only 0.075. This makes the in&#8208;plane chemical expansion coefficient of Td'&#8208;Li0.5&#8722;&#948;WTe2 far greater than of any other single&#8208;phase material, enabling fast and efficient planar electrochemical actuation.

         <title>Enhancing Thermoelectric Power Factor of 2D Organometal Halide Perovskites by Suppressing 2D/3D Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing the dimension of the perovskite structure from 3D (MASnI3) to 2D [(PEA)2(MA)n&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3, 4)] enables a facile control of carrier concentration and induces the quantum confinement effect. Both the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity increase at an optimum n, which results in a high thermoelectric power factor of 111 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) exhibit superior charge transport characteristics and ultralow thermal conductivities. However, thermoelectric (TE) applications of OHPs have been limited because of difficulties in controlling their carrier concentration, which is a key to optimizing their TE properties. Here, facile control of the carrier concentration in Sn&#8208;based OHPs is achieved by developing 2D crystal structures. The 2D OHP crystals are laterally oriented using a mixed solvent, and the morphology and crystal structure of the coexisting 2D/3D hybrid structures are systematically controlled via doping with methylammonium chloride. The effective number neff of inorganic octahedron layers in the 2D OHPs shows a strong positive correlation with the carrier concentration. Moreover, the 2D structure induces the quantum confinement effect, which enhances both the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. A 2D OHP shows a high power factor of 111 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which is an order of magnitude greater than the power factor of its 3D counterpart.
