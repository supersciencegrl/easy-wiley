      <title>Defect Control for 12.5% Efficiency Cu2ZnSnSe4 Kesterite Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells by Engineering of Local Chemical Environment</title>
      <dc:description>
Kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) thin film solar cells with independently confirmed 12.5% total area efficiency have been demonstrated with a novel strategy to effectively control the formation of intrinsic defects and defect clusters in CZTSe by carefully engineering the local chemical environment (e.g., suitable local chemical composition, oxidation states of cations) during film growth.








Abstract
Kesterite&#8208;based Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 semiconductors are emerging as promising materials for low&#8208;cost, environment&#8208;benign, and high&#8208;efficiency thin&#8208;film photovoltaics. However, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 devices suffer from cation&#8208;disordering defects and defect clusters, which generally result in severe potential fluctuation, low minority carrier lifetime, and ultimately unsatisfactory performance. Herein, critical growth conditions are reported for obtaining high&#8208;quality Cu2ZnSnSe4 absorber layers with the formation of detrimental intrinsic defects largely suppressed. By controlling the oxidation states of cations and modifying the local chemical composition, the local chemical environment is essentially modified during the synthesis of kesterite phase, thereby effectively suppressing detrimental intrinsic defects and activating desirable shallow acceptor Cu vacancies. Consequently, a confirmed 12.5% efficiency is demonstrated with a high VOC of 491&#160;mV, which is the new record efficiency of pure&#8208;selenide Cu2ZnSnSe4 cells with lowest VOC deficit in the kesterite family by Eg/q&#8208;Voc. These encouraging results demonstrate an essential route to overcome the long&#8208;standing challenge of defect control in kesterite semiconductors, which may also be generally applicable to other multinary compound semiconductors.

      <title>New High Donor Electrolyte for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
1,3&#8208;Dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a promising high donor electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. DMI, in which polysulfides are highly soluble, allows cell operation under lean electrolyte conditions and diversifies reaction routes involving the sulfur radical. The addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the interface with the Li metal anode, achieving superior cyclability under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
The unparalleled theoretical specific energy of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries has attracted considerable research interest from within the battery community. However, most of the long cycling results attained thus far relies on using a large amount of electrolyte in the cell, which adversely affects the specific energy of Li&#8211;S batteries. This shortcoming originates from the low solubility of polysulfides in the electrolyte. Here, 1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;imidazolidinone (DMI) is reported as a new high donor electrolyte for Li&#8211;S batteries. The high solubility of polysulfides in DMI and its activation of a new reaction route, which engages the sulfur radical (S3&#8226;&#8722;), enables the efficient utilization of sulfur as reflected in the specific capacity of 1595&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under lean electrolyte conditions of 5 &#956;Lelectrolyte mgsulfur&#8722;1. Moreover, the addition of LiNO3 stabilizes the lithium metal interface, thereby elevating the cycling performance to one of the highest known for high donor electrolytes in Li&#8211;S cells. These engineered high donor electrolytes are expected to advance Li&#8211;S batteries to cover a wide range of practical applications, particularly by incorporating established strategies to realize the reversibility of lithium metal electrodes.

      <title>Topotactically Transformed Polygonal Mesopores on Ternary Layered Double Hydroxides Exposing Under&#8208;Coordinated Metal Centers for Accelerated Water Dissociation</title>
      <dc:description>
A unique metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;mediated topotactic transformation strategy is deployed to fabricate holey ternary layered double hydroxides, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The under&#8208;coordinated metal centers and Fe&#8208;modulated electronic states synergistically promote the kinetics of water dissociation in hydrogen evolution reaction, ultimately leading to superb overall water splitting performance.








Abstract
Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been recognized as potent electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but are lacking in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activities due to the sluggish kinetics of water dissociation in alkaline medium. Herein, aiming to simultaneously bolster the HER and OER kinetics, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) mediated topotactic transformation tactic is deployed to fabricate holey ternary CoFeNi LDHs on nickel foam, exposing polygonal mesopores with atomistic edge steps and lattice defects. The optimized catalyst requires only an external voltage of 1.49&#160;V to afford the water splitting current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 apart from the superb electrolytic stability, far surpassing the benchmark Pt/C||RuO2 couple. More importantly, mechanistic investigations utilizing advanced spectroscopies in conjunction with density function theory (DFT) understandings unravel while the synergetic effect among under&#8208;coordinated metal centers lowers the energy barrier of water dissociation, Fe&#8208;doping enables further modulating the d&#8208;band density of states (DOS) of Co and Ni in favor of intermediates binding, thereby promoting the intrinsic HER activity. Operando Raman studies reveal negligible structural change of the LDHs during the HER process, whereas for OER the active sites can quickly turn into oxyhydroxides in the presence of lattice defects and under&#8208;coordinated metal centers.

      <dc:description>
Hierarchical molecular&#8208;imprinted inverse opal particles integrated with a herringbone microfluidic chip are fabricated by mimicking self&#8208;purification in the kidney, which removes a number of biomolecules with different sizes simultaneously. This platform exhibits excellent specific and multiple adsorption, optical sensing ability, biosafety and biocompatibility, and reusability.

Abstract
Blood purification by adsorption of excessive biomolecules is vital for maintaining human health. Here, inspired by kidney self&#8208;purification, which removes a number of biomolecules with different sizes simultaneously, hierarchical molecular&#8208;imprinted inverse opal particles integrated with a herringbone microfluidic chip for efficient biomolecules cleaning are presented. The particle possesses combinative porous structure with both surface and interior imprints for the specific recognition of small molecules and biomacromolecules. Additionally, the presence of the herringbone mixer largely improve the adsorption efficiency due to enhanced mixing. Moreover, the inverse opal framework of the particles give rise to optical sensing ability for self&#8208;reporting of the adsorption states. These features, together with its reusability, biosafety, and biocompatibility, make the platform highly promising for clinical blood purification and artificial kidney construction.

      <title>Topology&#8208;Controlled Hydration of Polymer Network in Hydrogels for Solar&#8208;Driven Wastewater Treatment</title>
      <dc:description>
A hydrogel with topology&#8208;controlled hydration behavior is designed to tune the water evaporation behavior for highly efficient solar&#8208;driven wastewater treatment. The polystyrene sulfonate network generates activated water through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding with water molecules. The polyvinyl alcohol network restricts saturated water content for energy concentration. An evaporation rate of &#8776;3.9&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under one&#8208;sun irradiation is achieved.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation provides a promising method for sustainable freshwater production. However, high energy consumption of vapor generation fundamentally restricts practicality of solar&#8208;driven wastewater treatment. Here a facile strategy is reported to control the hydration of polymer network in hydrogels, where densely cross&#8208;linked polymers serving as a framework are functionalized by a highly hydratable polymeric network. The hydration of polymer chains generates a large amount of weakly bounded water molecules, facilitating the water evaporation. As a result, the hydrogel&#8208;based solar evaporator can extract water from a variety of contaminants such as salts, detergents, and heavy metal components using solar energy with long&#8208;term durability and stability. This work demonstrates an effective way to tune the interaction between water and materials at a molecular level, as well as an energy&#8208;efficient water treatment technology toward wastewater containing complex contaminants.

      <title>A Superhydrophobic Droplet&#8208;Based Magnetoelectric Hybrid System to Generate Electricity and Collect Water Simultaneously</title>
      <dc:description>
The fabrication of a miniature, flexible, and superhydrophobic droplet&#8208;based magnetoelectric system (SDMS) capable of generating electricity is demonstrated. Furthermore, the SDMS is incorporated with a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic pattern, allowing simultaneous electricity generation and water collection from fog. It is believed that the magnetoelectric strategy can enhance and extend functions in a range of energy&#8208;harvesting fields.








Abstract
Traditional electromagnetic generators used in hydraulic power generation are heavy, bulky, and immovable, and are thus unsuitable for low water supply. A portable miniature electromagnetic system that can harvest energy from rainwater is critical for developing a sustainable energy strategy. In this study, a superhydrophobic droplet&#8208;based magnetoelectric hybrid system is fabricated, that can generate electricity from tiny water droplets. The magnetoelectric system (MS) comprises three parts: a superhydrophobic surface containing a conductive coil, liquid droplets, and a superhydrophobic magnetic powders/Ecoflex base. The mechanical impact of a falling water droplet onto the assembled system is transformed into electricity. Maxwell numerical simulation is used to analyze the related mechanism; the magnetoelectric performance is further improved by modifying the process parameters such as droplet falling velocity and magnetic powder contents. Furthermore, a model is developed, comprising the MS and a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic patterned plate that can generate electricity and collect water from fog, simultaneously. The described magnetoelectric strategy is believed to enhance and extend functions in energy harvesting and provide a generalized method to exploit new systems toward sustainable energy development.

Furthermore, a model is developed, comprising the MS and a cactus&#8208;like superhydrophobic patterned plate that can generate electricity and collect water from fog, simultaneously. The described magnetoelectric strategy is believed to enhance and extend functions in energy harvesting and provide a generalized method to exploit new systems toward sustainable energy development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Weakly Humidity&#8208;Dependent Proton&#8208;Conducting COF Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
A bottom&#8208;up approach based on the diffusion and solvent co&#8208;mediated growth of covalent organic frameworks is proposed to synthesize nanosheets of a highly crystalline, intrinsically proton&#8208;conducting COF (IPC&#8208;COF) in aqueous solution. The high&#8208;quality IPC&#8208;COF nanosheets allow the fabrication of defect&#8208;free and robust IPC&#8208;COF membranes that exhibit a weakly humidity&#8208;dependent proton conduction and a prominent fuel cell performance.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art proton exchange membranes (PEMs) often suffer from significantly reduced conductivity under low relative humidity, hampering their efficient application in fuel cells. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with pre&#8208;designable and well&#8208;defined structures hold promise to cope with the above challenge. However, fabricating defect&#8208;free, robust COF membranes proves an extremely difficult task due to the poor processability of COF materials. Herein, a bottom&#8208;up approach is developed to synthesize intrinsic proton&#8208;conducting COF (IPC&#8208;COF) nanosheets (NUS&#8208;9) in aqueous solutions via diffusion and solvent co&#8208;mediated modulation, enabling a controlled nucleation and in&#8208;plane&#8208;dominated IPC&#8208;COF growth. These nanosheets allow the facile fabrication of IPC&#8208;COF membranes. IPC&#8208;COF membranes with crystalline, rigid ion nanochannels exhibit a weakly humidity&#8208;dependent conductivity over a wide range of humidity (30&#8211;98%), 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than that of benchmark PEMs, and a prominent fuel cell performance of 0.93&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 35% RH and 80&#160;&#176;C arising from superior water retention and Grotthuss mechanism&#8208;dominated proton conduction.

      <title>A Single&#8208;Mode, Self&#8208;Adapting, and Self&#8208;Powered Mechanoreceptor Based on a Potentiometric&#8211;Triboelectric Hybridized Sensing Mechanism for Resolving Complex Stimuli</title>
      <dc:description>
A new potentiometric&#8211;triboelectric hybridized mechanotransduction mechanism is proposed to create single&#8208;mode, self&#8208;adapting, and self&#8208;powered artificial mechanoreceptors. Such mechanoreceptors enable complex mechanical stimuli to be resolved with greatly simplified fabrication/operation and enhanced functionality/energy&#8208;efficiency. The promising applications of the mechanoreceptors in monitoring object manipulation and detecting complex stimuli in diverse practical scenarios of daily life is explored.








Abstract
Human skin is equipped with slow adapting (SA) and fast adapting (FA) capabilities simultaneously. To mimic such functionalities, elaborately designed devices have been explored by integrating multiple sensing elements or adopting multimode sensing principles. However, the complicated fabrication, signal mismatch of different modules, complex operation, and high power&#8208;consumption hinder their widespread applications. Here, a new type of single&#8208;mode and self&#8208;powered mechanoreceptor that can mimic both SA and FA via seamless fusion of complementary while compatible potentiometric and triboelectric sensing principles is reported. The resultant potentiometric&#8211;triboelectric hybridized mechanoreceptor exhibits distinctive features that are hard to achieve via currently existing methods, including single&#8208;mode output (only voltage signal), greatly simplified operation (single&#8208;measurement setup), ultralow power&#8208;consumption (&lt;1 nW), self&#8208;adaptive response behavior, and good capability for resolving complex stimuli. Diverse mechanical characteristics, including magnitude, duration, frequency, applying and releasing speed, can be well interpreted with this single&#8208;mode and self&#8208;powered mechanoreceptor. Its promising application for monitoring object manipulations with a soft robotic gripper is explored. Furthermore, the versatility of the mechanoreceptor for resolving complex stimuli in diverse daily scenarios is demonstrated. This work presents a new design that will significantly simplify the fabrication/operation and meanwhile boost the functionality/energy&#8208;efficiency of future electronic devices and smart systems.

      <title>3D Printing of a V8C7&#8211;VO2 Bifunctional Scaffold as an Effective Polysulfide Immobilizer and Lithium Stabilizer for Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; 3D&#8208;printing strategy for customizing bifunctional V8C7&#8211;VO2 scaffolds simultaneously realizes effective polysulfide immobilization and lithium stabilization targeting advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have heretofore attracted tremendous interest due to low cost and high energy density. In this realm, both the severe shuttling of polysulfide and the uncontrollable growth of dendritic lithium have greatly hindered their commercial viability. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of rational approaches to simultaneously regulate polysulfide behaviors and restrain lithium dendritic growth. Nevertheless, the major obstacles for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries still lie in little knowledge of bifunctional material candidates and inadequate explorations of advanced technologies for customizable devices. Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is put forward to elaborate V8C7&#8211;VO2 heterostructure scaffolds via the 3D printing (3DP) technique as dual&#8208;effective polysulfide immobilizer and lithium dendrite inhibitor for Li&#8211;S batteries. A thus&#8208;derived 3DP&#8208;V8C7&#8211;VO2/S electrode demostrates excellent rate capability (643.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6.0 C) and favorable cycling stability (a capacity decay of 0.061% per cycle at 4.0 C after 900 cycles). Importantly, the integrated Li&#8211;S battery harnessing both 3DP hosts realizes high areal capacity under high sulfur loadings (7.36 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 9.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). This work offers insight into solving the concurrent challenges for both S cathode and Li anode throughout 3DP.

      <title>Cooperative Catalysis toward Oxygen Reduction Reaction under Dual Coordination Environments on Intrinsic AMnO3&#8208;Type Perovskites via Regulating Stacking Configurations of Coordination Units</title>
      <dc:description>
The intrinsic superior oxygen reduction reaction activity of SrMnO3 stems from mixed cubic and hexagonal stacking configurations, introducing cooperative catalysis under Mn&#63743;Ocorner and Mn&#63743;Oface coordination environments. The filling of the Ovacancy in the Ocorner site influences the charge distribution in Oface, which modifies the surface interaction strength with intermediates and triggers active site migration from atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#63743;Mn bridge (*O, *OH).








Abstract
It remains challenging for pure&#8208;phase catalysts to achieve high performance during the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction to overcome the sluggish kinetics without the assistance of extrinsic conditions. Herein, a series of pristine perovskites, i.e., AMnO3 (A = Ca, Sr, and Ba), are proposed with various octahedron stacking configurations to demonstrate the cooperative catalysis over SrMnO3 jointly explored by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Comparing with the unitary stacking of coordination units in CaMnO3 or BaMnO3, the intrinsic SrMnO3 with a mixture of corner&#8208;sharing and face&#8208;sharing octahedron stacking configurations demonstrates superior activity (Ehalf&#8208;wave&#160;= 0.81 V), and charge&#8211;discharge stability over 400 h without the voltage gap (&#8776;0.8 V) increasing in zinc&#8211;air batteries. The theoretical study reveals that, on the SrMnO3(110) surface, the active sites switch from coordinatively unsaturated atop Mn (*OO, *OOH) to Mn&#8211;Mn bridge (*O, *OH). Therefore, the intrinsic dual coordination environments of Mn&#8211;Ocorner and Mn&#8211;Oface enable cooperative modulation of the interaction strength of the oxygen intermediates with the surface, inducing the decrease of the *OH desorption energy (rate&#8208;limiting step) unrestricted by scaling relationships with the overpotential of &#8776;0.28 V. This finding provides insights into catalyst design through screening intrinsic structures with multiple coordination unit stacking configurations.

      <title>Antibacterial Action of Nanoparticles by Lethal Stretching of Bacterial Cell Membranes</title>
      <dc:description>
The mechanism of antimicrobial action for nanoparticles that are unable to translocate across the bacterial cell wall remains obscure. In this work, it is demonstrated that the increase of membrane tension provoked by the adsorption of nanoparticles is responsible for mechanical deformation of the membrane, which leads to bacterial cell rupture and death.








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that nanoparticles (NPs) can kill bacteria; however, the mechanism of antimicrobial action remains obscure for large NPs that cannot translocate the bacterial cell wall. It is demonstrated that the increase in membrane tension caused by the adsorption of NPs is responsible for mechanical deformation, leading to cell rupture and death. A biophysical model of the NP&#8211;membrane interactions is presented which suggests that adsorbed NPs cause membrane stretching and squeezing. This general phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally using both model membranes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, representing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria.

     alt="Antibacterial Action of Nanoparticles by Lethal Stretching of Bacterial Cell Membranes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mechanism of antimicrobial action for nanoparticles that are unable to translocate across the bacterial cell wall remains obscure. In this work, it is demonstrated that the increase of membrane tension provoked by the adsorption of nanoparticles is responsible for mechanical deformation of the membrane, which leads to bacterial cell rupture and death.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is commonly accepted that nanoparticles (NPs) can kill bacteria; however, the mechanism of antimicrobial action remains obscure for large NPs that cannot translocate the bacterial cell wall. It is demonstrated that the increase in membrane tension caused by the adsorption of NPs is responsible for mechanical deformation, leading to cell rupture and death. A biophysical model of the NP&#8211;membrane interactions is presented which suggests that adsorbed NPs cause membrane stretching and squeezing. This general phenomenon is demonstrated experimentally using both model membranes and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, representing Gram&#8208;positive and Gram&#8208;negative bacteria. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic quasi&#8208;spherical and star&#8208;shaped gold (Au)NPs are synthesized to explore the antibacterial mechanism of non&#8208;translocating AuNPs. Direct observation of nanoparticle&#8208;induced membrane tension and squeezing is demonstrated using a custom&#8208;designed microfluidic device, which relieves contraction of the model membrane surface area and eventual lipid bilayer collapse. Quasi&#8208;spherical nanoparticles exhibit a greater bactericidal action due to a higher interactive affinity, resulting in greater membrane stretching and rupturing, corroborating the theoretical model. Electron microscopy techniques are used to characterize the NP&#8211;bacterial&#8208;membrane interactions.

      <title>Choose Your Own Adventure: Fabrication of Monolithic All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
The fabrication challenges of monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem photovoltaics are detailed in a step&#8208;by&#8208;step, choose your own adventure fashion. The trade&#8208;offs between sub&#8208;cell efficiency and processing stability are highlighted and pros and cons are weighed. Through this detailed analysis, a few routes to reach &gt;30%&#160;power conversion efficiency and the necessary work are identified.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have transfixed the photovoltaic (PV) community due to their outstanding and tunable optoelectronic properties coupled to demonstrations of high&#8208;power conversion efficiencies (PCE) at a range of bandgaps. This has motivated the field to push perovskites to reach the highest possible performance. One way to increase the efficiency is by fabricating multijunction solar cells, which can split the solar spectrum, reducing thermalization loss. Low&#8208;cost all&#8208;perovskite tandems have a real chance to soon exceed 30% PCE, which could transform the PV industry. Achieving this goal requires the identification of perovskite sub&#8208;cells that are both highly efficient and can be effectively integrated. Herein, it is discussed how to navigate the multiple&#8208;choice adventure in choosing between the myriad of options and considerations present when deciding what perovskite materials, contact layers, and processing tools to use. Some of the potential fabrication pitfalls often encountered in MHP based tandem PVs are highlighted, so that they can hopefully be avoided in the future.

      <title>Healable, Recyclable, and Mechanically Tough Polyurethane Elastomers with Exceptional Damage Tolerance</title>
      <dc:description>
Healable, recyclable, and mechanically tough elastomers with exceptional fracture energy of &#8776;192.9&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 are fabricated by cross&#8208;linking polyurethanes with in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed dynamic hierarchical domains capable of deformation and disintegration under external force. Elastomers can be healed and recycled in a highly efficient way to restore their original mechanical properties.








Abstract
There is a huge requirement of elastomers for use in tires, seals, and shock absorbers every year worldwide. In view of a sustainable society, the next generation of elastomers is expected to combine outstanding healing, recycling, and damage&#8208;tolerant capacities with high strength, elasticity, and toughness. However, it remains challenging to fabricate such elastomers because the mechanisms for the properties mentioned above are mutually exclusive. Herein, the fabrication of healable, recyclable, and mechanically tough polyurethane (PU) elastomers with outstanding damage tolerance by coordination of multiblock polymers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/polycaprolactone (PCL) containing hydrogen and coordination bonding motifs with Zn2+ ions is reported. The organization of bipyridine groups coordinated with Zn2+ ions, carbamate groups cross&#8208;linked with hydrogen bonds, and crystallized PCL segments generates phase&#8208;separated dynamic hierarchical domains. Serving as rigid nanofillers capable of deformation and disintegration under an external force, the dynamic hierarchical domains can strengthen the elastomers and significantly enhance their toughness and fracture energy. As a result, the elastomers exhibit a tensile strength of &#8776;52.4&#160;MPa, a toughness of &#8776;363.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and an exceptional fracture energy of &#8776;192.9&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, the elastomers can be conveniently healed and recycled to regain their original mechanical properties and integrity under heating.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Resonance Energy Transfer for Construction of Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Imaging Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Phosphorescence resonance energy transfer is introduced to transfer the short&#8208;wavelength emission of organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence luminogens to near&#8208;infrared fluorescent luminogens for realization of near&#8208;infrared afterglow in vivo imaging. The doped nanoparticles of mTPA&#8208;N are applied for subcutaneous and lymph&#8208;node imaging in living mice with extremely low background noise and deep tissue penetration.








Abstract
Afterglow imaging that detects photons after cessation of optical excitation avoids tissue autofluorescence and thus possesses higher sensitivity than traditional fluorescence imaging. Purely organic molecules with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) have emerged as a new library of benign afterglow agents. However, most RTP luminogens only emit visible light with shallow tissue penetration, constraining their in vivo applications. This study presents an organic RTP nanoprobe (mTPA&#8208;N) with emission in the NIR range for in vivo afterglow imaging. Such a probe is composed of RTP molecule (mTPA) as the phosphorescent generator and an NIR&#8208;fluorescent dye as the energy acceptor to enable room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence resonance energy transfer (RT&#8208;PRET), ultimately resulting in redshifted phosphorescent emission at 780&#160;nm. Because of the elimination of background noise and redshifted afterglow luminescence in a biologically transparent window, mTPA&#8208;N permits imaging of lymph nodes in living mice with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This study thus opens up a universal approach to develop organic RTP luminogens into NIR afterglow imaging agents via construction of RT&#8208;PRET.

      <title>Tissue&#8208;Adaptive Materials with Independently Regulated Modulus and Transition Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Bottlebrush elastomers with crystallizable side chains undergo dramatic softening transition upon heating. At body temperature &#8776;37 &#176;C,&#160;these materials drop their modulus by up to six orders of magnitude transitioning from hard plastic to tissue&#8208;like elastomer with transition temperature and modulus controlled by brush architecture. Simultaneously, materials softening triggers drug release, thus highlighting their potential as tissue&#8208;adaptive implants.








Abstract
The ability of living species to transition between rigid and flexible shapes represents one of their survival mechanisms, which has been adopted by various human technologies. Such transition is especially desired in medical devices as rigidity facilitates the implantation process, while flexibility and softness favor biocompatibility with surrounding tissue. Traditional thermoplastics cannot match soft tissue mechanics, while gels leach into the body and alter their properties over time. Here, a single&#8208;component system with an unprecedented drop of Young's modulus by up to six orders of magnitude from the GPa to kPa level at a controlled temperature within 28&#8211;43&#160;&#176;C is demonstrated. This approach is based on brush&#8208;like polymer networks with crystallizable side chains, e.g., poly(valerolactone), affording independent control of melting temperature and Young's modulus by concurrently altering side chain length and crosslink density. Softening down to the tissue level at the physiological temperature allows the design of tissue&#8208;adaptive implants that can be inserted as rigid devices followed by matching the surrounding tissue mechanics at body temperature. This transition also enables thermally triggered release of embedded drugs for anti&#8208;inflammatory treatment.

      <title>Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Insulator Transition and Orbital Polarization in Nickelate Superlattices Integrated on Silicon</title>
      <dc:description>
Strain engineering is well demonstrated for perovskite oxides, mostly by growing epitaxial films onto an isostructural oxide substrate having different lattice constant. The joint effects of epitaxial and thermal strain on the metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and orbital configuration are revealed for nickelate superlattices grown on silicon substrates, illustrating the feasibility of extending strain engineering to the technologically important silicon platform.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth of SrTiO3 (STO) on silicon greatly accelerates the monolithic integration of multifunctional oxides into the mainstream semiconductor electronics. However, oxide superlattices (SLs), the birthplace of many exciting discoveries, remain largely unexplored on silicon. In this work, LaNiO3/LaFeO3 SLs are synthesized on STO&#8208;buffered silicon (Si/STO) and STO single&#8208;crystal substrates, and their electronic properties are compared using dc transport and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Both sets of SLs show a similar thickness&#8208;driven metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, albeit with resistivity and transition temperature modified by the different amounts of strain. In particular, the large tensile strain promotes a pronounced Ni 3dx2&#8722;y2 orbital polarization for the SL grown on Si/STO, comparable to that reported for LaNiO3 SL epitaxially strained to DyScO3 substrate. Those results illustrate the ability to integrate oxide SLs on silicon with structure and property approaching their counterparts grown on STO single crystal, and also open up new prospects of strain engineering in functional oxides based on the Si platform.

     alt="Strain&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8208;to&#8208;Insulator Transition and Orbital Polarization in Nickelate Superlattices Integrated on Silicon"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain engineering is well demonstrated for perovskite oxides, mostly by growing epitaxial films onto an isostructural oxide substrate having different lattice constant. The joint effects of epitaxial and thermal strain on the metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition and orbital configuration are revealed for nickelate superlattices grown on silicon substrates, illustrating the feasibility of extending strain engineering to the technologically important silicon platform.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epitaxial growth of SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (STO) on silicon greatly accelerates the monolithic integration of multifunctional oxides into the mainstream semiconductor electronics. However, oxide superlattices (SLs), the birthplace of many exciting discoveries, remain largely unexplored on silicon. In this work, LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/LaFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SLs are synthesized on STO&#8208;buffered silicon (Si/STO) and STO single&#8208;crystal substrates, and their electronic properties are compared using dc transport and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. Both sets of SLs show a similar thickness&#8208;driven metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transition, albeit with resistivity and transition temperature modified by the different amounts of strain. In particular, the large tensile strain promotes a pronounced Ni 3dx2&#8722;y2 orbital polarization for the SL grown on Si/STO, comparable to that reported for LaNiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SL epitaxially strained to DyScO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; substrate. Those results illustrate the ability to integrate oxide SLs on silicon with structure and property approaching their counterparts grown on STO single crystal, and also open up new prospects of strain engineering in functional oxides based on the Si platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Synthesis of 2D Janus Crystals and their Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Janus crystals represent an exciting class of 2D materials with different atomic species on their upper and lower facets. Theories predict that this broken symmetry leads to a wealth of novel properties. A room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers and their lateral and vertical heterostructures with high structural and optical quality is reported.








Abstract
Janus crystals represent an exciting class of 2D materials with different atomic species on their upper and lower facets. Theories have predicted that this symmetry breaking induces an electric field and leads to a wealth of novel properties, such as large Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and formation of strongly correlated electronic states. Monolayer MoSSe Janus crystals have been synthesized by two methods, via controlled sulfurization of monolayer MoSe2 and via plasma stripping followed thermal annealing of MoS2. However, the high processing temperatures prevent growth of other Janus materials and their heterostructures. Here, a room&#8208;temperature technique for the synthesis of a variety of Janus monolayers with high structural and optical quality is reported. This process involves low&#8208;energy reactive radical precursors, which enables selective removal and replacement of the uppermost chalcogen layer, thus transforming classical transition metal dichalcogenides into a Janus structure. The resulting materials show clear mixed character for their excitonic transitions, and more importantly, the presented room&#8208;temperature method enables the demonstration of first vertical and lateral heterojunctions of 2D Janus TMDs. The results present significant and pioneering advances in the synthesis of new classes of 2D materials, and pave the way for the creation of heterostructures from 2D Janus layers.

      <title>Blood&#8208;Derived Biomaterial for Catheter&#8208;Directed Arterial Embolization</title>
      <dc:description>
Blood&#8208;derived biomaterial is engineered for catheter&#8208;directed arterial embolization. This embolic biomaterial shows remarkable modulus, radiopacity, retrievability, and bioactivity, capable of achieving durable embolization in porcine iliac and renal arteries. The blood&#8208;derived biomaterial is a simple and affordable embolic biomaterial that can be prepared at the point of care for emergency embolization procedures including the treatment of bleeding arteries.








Abstract
Vascular embolization is a life&#8208;saving minimally invasive catheter&#8208;based procedure performed to treat bleeding vessels. Through these catheters, numerous metallic coils are often pushed into the bleeding artery to stop the blood flow. While there are numerous drawbacks to coil embolization, physician expertise, availability of these coils, and their costs further limit their use. Here, a novel blood&#8208;derived embolic material (BEM) with regenerative properties, that can achieve instant and durable intra&#8208;arterial hemostasis regardless of coagulopathy, is developed. In a large animal model of vascular embolization, it is shown that the BEM can be prepared at the point&#8208;of&#8208;care within 26 min using fresh blood, it can be easily delivered using clinical catheters to embolize renal and iliac arteries, and it can achieve rapid hemostasis in acutely injured vessels. In swine arteries, the BEM increases cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue deposition, suggesting vessel healing and durable vessel occlusion. The BEM has significant advantages over embolic materials used today, making it a promising new tool for embolization.

As stretchable and transparent ionic conductor, polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels are developed as human&#8211;machine interactive touch pads with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates with high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and play electrical games.








Abstract
There is an increasing interest to develop a next generation of touch pads that require stretchability and biocompatibility to allow their integration with a human body, and even to mimic the self&#8208;healing behavior with fast functionality recovery upon damage. However, most touch pads are developed based on stiff and brittle electrodes with the lack of the important nature of self&#8208;healing. Polyzwitterion&#8211;clay nanocomposite hydrogels as a soft, stretchable, and transparent ionic conductor with transmittance of 98.8% and fracture strain beyond 1500% are developed, which can be used as a self&#8208;healing human&#8211;machine interactive touch pad with pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesiveness on target substrates. A surface&#8208;capacitive touch system is adopted to sense a touched position. Finger positions are perceived during both point&#8208;by&#8208;point touch and continuous moving. Hydrogel touch pads are adhered to curved or flat insulators, with the high&#8208;resolution and self&#8208;healable input functions demonstrated by drawing, writing, and playing electronic games.

      <dc:description>
Selenium has an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect when charging commercial LiCoO2 to high voltages, by substituting part of the mobile oxidized oxygen ions (O&#945;&#8208;) in the charged lattice to eliminate oxygen vacancies, transplant the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8208;, and reduce the mobile O&#945;&#8208; ions back to immobile O2&#8208; ions, to stop further oxygen migration and stabilize the high&#8208;voltage cycling.








Abstract
Cycling LiCoO2 to above 4.5&#160;V for higher capacity is enticing; however, hybrid O anion&#8208; and Co cation&#8208;redox (HACR) at high voltages facilitates intrinsic O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&#160;&lt; 2) migration, causing oxygen loss, phase collapse, and electrolyte decomposition that severely degrade the battery cyclability. Hereby, commercial LiCoO2 particles are operando treated with selenium, a well&#8208;known anti&#8208;aging element to capture oxygen&#8208;radicals in the human body, showing an &#8220;anti&#8208;aging&#8221; effect in high&#8208;voltage battery cycling and successfully stopping the escape of oxygen from LiCoO2 even when the cathode is cycled to 4.62 V. Ab initio calculation and soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis suggest that during deep charging, the precoated Se will initially substitute some mobile O&#945;&#8722; at the charged LiCoO2 surface, transplanting the pumped charges from O&#945;&#8722; and reducing it back to O2&#8722; to stabilize the oxygen lattice in prolonged cycling. As a result, the material retains 80% and 77% of its capacity after 450 and 550 cycles under 100 mA g&#8722;1 in 4.57&#160;V pouch full&#8208;cells matched with a graphite anode and an ultralean electrolyte (2&#160;g Ah&#8722;1).

      <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Metal&#8208;Like Ultrahigh Free&#8208;Carrier Concentration in Metal&#8208;Oxide Material for Giant and Tunable Plasmon Resonance</title>
      <dc:description>
The giant and tunable plasmonic material of HxMoO3 holds a high free&#8208;carrier concentration up to 1021 cm&#8722;3, approaching that of metals. The unique quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure provides a long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field. Surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra with an enhancement factor of 1.1 &#215; 107 and a detection limit of 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1 are achieved, representing the best among the hitherto reported metal oxides.








Abstract
The practical utilization of plasmon&#8208;based technology relies on the ability to find high&#8208;performance plasmonic materials other than noble metals. A key scientific challenge is to significantly increase the intrinsically low concentration of free carriers in metal&#8208;oxide materials. Here, a novel electron&#8211;proton co&#8208;doping strategy is developed to achieve uniform hydrogen doping in metal&#8208;oxide MoO3 at mild conditions, which creates a metal&#8208;like ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration approaching that of noble metals (1021 cm&#8722;3 in H1.68MoO3 versus 1022 cm&#8722;3 in Au/Ag). This bestows giant and tunable plasmonic resonances in the visible region to this originally semiconductive material. Using ultrafast spectroscopy characterizations and first&#8208;principle simulations, the formation of a quasi&#8208;metallic energy band structure that leads to long&#8208;lived and strong plasmonic field is revealed. As verified by the surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) of rhodamine 6G molecules on HxMoO3, the SERS enhancement factor reaches as high as 1.1 &#215; 107 with a detection limit at concentration as low as 1 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mol L&#8722;1, representing the best among the hitherto reported non&#8208;metal systems. The findings not only provide a set of metal&#8208;like semiconductor materials with merits of low cost, tunable electronic structure, and plasmonic resonance, but also a general strategy to induce tunable ultrahigh free&#8208;carrier concentration in non&#8208;metal systems.

      <title>Biomimicking Antibacterial Opto&#8208;Electro Sensing Sutures Made of Regenerated Silk Proteins</title>
      <dc:description>
A set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures made of regenerated silk fibroin inspired by natural spider&#8208;silk fibers is presented. These sensing sutures are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized so as to integrate multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions include reducing inflammation, antibacterial activity, tension measurements, aiding tissue healing, and opto&#8208;electro monitoring.








Abstract
Surgical sutures play an important role across a wide range of medical treatments and a wide variety exist, differing in strength, size, composition, and performance. Recently, increasing interest has been paid to bioactive and electronic sutures made of synthetic polymers, owing to their ability to reduce inflammation as well as medically and/or electronically facilitate wound healing. However, integrating sensing capabilities into bioactive sutures without adversely affecting their mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and/or bioactivity remains challenging. In this work, a set of biomimicking, antibacterial, and sensing sutures based on the regenerated silk fibroin is designed and fabricated. These sensing sutures, inspired by the &#8220;core&#8211;shell&#8221; multilayered structure of natural spider&#8208;silk fibers, are hierarchically structured and heterogeneously functionalized to allow for the integration of multiple, clinically favorable functions into one suture device. These functions included: reducing inflammation and bacterial infection in wound sites, measuring tension of both the tissue and suture, and aiding tissue healing via multi&#8208;modal controlled drug and growth factor release. Critically, these functions are coupled with real&#8208;time optical and electronic monitoring capabilities. This approach provides greater insight into multifunctional sutures with inherent sensing capabilities and offers enormous potential in both therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

      <dc:description>
Successful use of optical waveguides is rare for a true remote sensing of biological objects. In article number 2005238, Dong Hyuk Park, Dong June Ahn, and co&#8208;workers report a waveguide hybrid&#8208;crystal of an organic semiconductor interfaced with nucleic acid molecules fabricated through a facile self&#8208;assembly method. This bio&#8208;hybrid 1D crystal responds to the extent of DNA&#8211;DNA interactions, and can discern, at the same time, a complementary target sequence at one end against a 1&#8208;mer mismatched case at the other end.

      <title>Memory Devices: Filament&#8208;Free Bulk Resistive Memory Enables Deterministic Analogue Switching (Adv. Mater. 45/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2003984, Yiyang Li, A. Alec Talin, and co&#8208;workers design a deterministic nonvolatile resistive memory cell without nanosized filaments. By using the statistical ensemble behavior of all point defects within the 3D bulk for information storage, they solve the challenge of stochastic switching that has plagued filament&#8208;based memristors. This provides a compelling artificial synapse for energy&#8208;efficient, neuromorphic computing.

      <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Dynamic Metaholographic Displays with Designer Liquid Crystal Modulators</title>
      <dc:description>
Liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based metamaterial devices, which can sense targeted stimuli such as electric&#8208;field, temperature and pressure, and report them optically by displaying corresponding holograms, are demonstrated. The demonstrated systems enable a variety of applications like hologram labels that indicate freshness of temperature&#8208;sensitive products during storage or transport and interactive holographic displays with touch sensing or motion recognition.








Abstract
Flat optics, realized by the artificially created 2D material platform called optical metasurfaces, is currently undergoing a science&#8208;to&#8208;technology transition. However, &#8220;real&#8208;time&#8221; active operations of such flat optical devices remain yet unresolved. Here, liquid crystals (LCs)&#8208;integrated metaholograms for ultracompact dynamic holographic displays are proposed. The anisotropic nature of the LCs allows facile and repeatable manipulation of the polarization of light. Specifically designed (&#8220;designer&#8221;) LCs and efficient helicity&#8208;encoded metaholograms are combined to realize stimuli&#8208;responsive dynamic displays. The designer LC modulators are used as switches that enable a variety of external stimuli (e.g., electric field, heat, surface pressure) to operate holographic images in real&#8208;time. Such a dynamic metaholographic platform will provide a path to external stimuli&#8208;driven &#8220;smart&#8221; sensing and display applications such as hologram labels for temperature/pressure/touch monitoring and interactive holographic displays with haptic motion recognition.

      <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Photoengraving of Monolithic, Multifaceted Metasurfaces</title>
      <dc:description>
A 3D photoengraving strategy capable of integrating diverse metasurfaces into a single composite monolith is demonstrated.&#160;This&#160;method facilitates micro&#8208;/nanoscale patterning of metasurfaces onto individual facets in a diverse range of 3D scaffolds, in an independent, high&#8208;throughput, and on&#8208;demand fashion.








Abstract
Metasurfaces present a potent platform to manipulate light by the spatial arrangement of sub&#8208;wavelength patterns with well&#8208;defined sizes and geometries, in thin films. Metasurfaces by definition are planar. However, it would be highly desirable to integrate metasurfaces with diverse, spatially programmed sub&#8208;wavelength features into a 3D monolith, to manipulate light within a compact 3D space. Here, a 3D photoengraving strategy is presented; that is, generation of such composite metasurfaces from a single microstructure via the irradiation of multiple interference laser beams onto different facets of the parent azopolymeric microstructure. Through &#8220;photofluidization,&#8221;&#160;this&#160;technique enables independent inscription and erasing of metasurfaces onto and from individual facets of 3D monoliths with arbitrary shapes and dimensions, in a high&#8208;throughput fashion (over approximately a few cm2 at a time). By engraving discrete sub&#8208;wavelength 1D surface relief gratings of different pitches on different facets of an inverse pyramidal array, a multiplexing structure&#8208;color filter is demonstrated.

      <title>Kinetically Stable Oxide Overlayers on Mo3P Nanoparticles Enabling Lithium&#8211;Air Batteries with Low Overpotentials and Long Cycle Life</title>
      <dc:description>
Mo3P nanoparticles with a kinetically stable oxide overlayer exhibit remarkable ORR/OER activities near thermodynamic potentials in non&#8208;aqueous media. Using this catalyst alongside TEMPO and DBBQ redox mediators in a lithium&#8211;air battery favors the solution&#8208;based mechanism for epitaxial growth of Li2O2 at the lowest overpotentials, the effects of which are addressed through directed experimental efforts in electrochemical characterization coupled with a computational approach.








Abstract
The main drawbacks of today's state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries are their low energy efficiency and limited cycle life due to the lack of earth&#8208;abundant cathode catalysts that can drive both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) at high rates at thermodynamic potentials. Here, inexpensive trimolybdenum phosphide (Mo3P) nanoparticles with an exceptional activity&#8212;ORR and OER current densities of 7.21 and 6.85 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.0 and 4.2 V versus Li/Li+, respectively&#8212;in an oxygen&#8208;saturated non&#8208;aqueous electrolyte are reported. The Tafel plots indicate remarkably low charge transfer resistance&#8212;Tafel slopes of 35 and 38 mV dec&#8722;1 for ORR and OER, respectively&#8212;resulting in the lowest ORR overpotential of 4.0 mV and OER overpotential of 5.1 mV reported to date. Using this catalyst, a Li&#8211;air battery cell with low discharge and charge overpotentials of 80 and 270 mV, respectively, and high energy efficiency of 90.2% in the first cycle is demonstrated. A long cycle life of 1200 is also achieved for this cell. Density functional theory calculations of ORR and OER on Mo3P (110) reveal that an oxide overlayer formed on the surface gives rise to the observed high ORR and OER electrocatalytic activity and small discharge/charge overpotentials.

      <title>Observation of Supercavity Modes in Subwavelength Dielectric Resonators</title>
      <dc:description>
Excitation of supercavity modes in high&#8208;index subwavelength dielectric resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is demonstrated in near&#8208;field and far&#8208;field measurements. The measured unloaded Q factor of supercavity modes is in the range from 500 to 12&#160;500, limited by absorption losses. A peculiar change of the directivity pattern of supercavity modes and their relation to Fano resonances is shown experimentally.








Abstract
Electromagnetic response of dielectric resonators with high refractive index is governed by optically induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances facilitating confinement of light with the amplitude enhancement. Traditionally, strong subwavelength trapping of light was associated only with plasmonic or epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero structures, which however suffer from material losses. Recently, an alternative localization mechanism was proposed allowing the trapping of light in individual subwavelength optical resonators with a high quality factor in the regime of a supercavity mode. Here, the experimental observation of the supercavity modes in subwavelength ceramic resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is presented. It is experimentally demonstrated that the regime of supercavity modes can be achieved via precise tuning of the resonator's dimensions. A huge growth of the unloaded quality factor is achieved with experimental values up to 1.25&#160;&#215; 104, limited only by material losses of ceramics. It is revealed that the supercavity modes can be excited efficiently both in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field. In both cases, the supercavity mode manifests itself explicitly as a Fano resonance with characteristic peculiarities of spectral shape and radiation pattern. A comparison of supercavities made of diversified materials for the visible, infrared, THz, and radio&#8208;frequency regimes is provided.

Traditionally, strong subwavelength trapping of light was associated only with plasmonic or epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero structures, which however suffer from material losses. Recently, an alternative localization mechanism was proposed allowing the trapping of light in individual subwavelength optical resonators with a high quality factor in the regime of a supercavity mode. Here, the experimental observation of the supercavity modes in subwavelength ceramic resonators in the radio&#8208;frequency range is presented. It is experimentally demonstrated that the regime of supercavity modes can be achieved via precise tuning of the resonator's dimensions. A huge growth of the unloaded quality factor is achieved with experimental values up to 1.25&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, limited only by material losses of ceramics. It is revealed that the supercavity modes can be excited efficiently both in the near&#8208; and far&#8208;field. In both cases, the supercavity mode manifests itself explicitly as a Fano resonance with characteristic peculiarities of spectral shape and radiation pattern. A comparison of supercavities made of diversified materials for the visible, infrared, THz, and radio&#8208;frequency regimes is provided.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Solvent&#8208;Exchange Strategy to Regulate Noncovalent Interactions for Strong and Antiswelling Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
A solvent&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to construct a class of stiff and antiswelling hydrogels (named as exogels). Key to this approach is the rational regulation of noncovalent interactions and thus the conformation of polymers and structure of the cross&#8208;linked networks. Moreover, the unique sol&#8211;gel progression via solvent exchange makes exogels applicable for robust underwater adhesion.








Abstract
Physical hydrogels from existing polymers consisting of noncovalent interacting networks are highly desired due to their well&#8208;controlled compositions and environmental friendliness; and therefore, applied as adhesives, artificial tissues, and soft machines. Nevertheless, these gels have suffered from weak mechanical strength and low water resistance. Current methodologies used to fabricate these hydrogels mainly involve the freezing&#8211;thawing process (cryogels), which are complicated in preparation and short in adjustment of polymer conformation. Here, taking the merits of noncovalent bonds in adjustability and reversibility, a solvent&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to construct a class of exogels. Based on the exchange from a good solvent subsequently to a poor one, the intra&#8208; and interpolymer interactions are initially suppressed and then recovered, resulting in dissolving and cross&#8208;linking to polymers, respectively. Key to this approach is the good solvent, which favors of a stretched polymer conformation to homogenize the network, forming cross&#8208;linked hydrogel networks with remarkable stiffness, toughness, antiswelling properties, and thus underwater adhesive performance. The exogels highlight a facile but highly effective strategy of turning the solvent and consequently the noncovalent interactions to achieve the rational design of enhanced hydrogels and hydrogel&#8208;based soft materials.

      <title>Van der Waals Epitaxial Growth of Mosaic&#8208;Like 2D Platinum Ditelluride Layers for Room&#8208;Temperature Mid&#8208;Infrared Photodetection up to 10.6 &#181;m</title>
      <dc:description>
Van der Waals epitaxial growth of wafer&#8208;scale mosaic&#8208;like 2D PtTe2 layer is achieved for highly sensitive MIR photodetection. A photodetector based on a PtTe2/Si Schottky junction is capable of sensing ultrabroadband light of up to 10.6 &#181;m with a high specific detectivity. The photodetector arrays also display an excellent room&#8208;temperature MIR imaging capability.








Abstract
Mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) photodetection, covering diverse molecular vibrational regions and atmospheric transmission windows, is vital to civil and military purposes. Versatile use of MIR photodetectors is commonly dominated by HgCdTe alloys, InSb, and quantum superlattices, which are limited by strict operation demands, high&#8208;cost, and environmental toxicity. Despite the rapid advances of black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based MIR photodetectors, these are subject to poor stability and large&#8208;area integration difficulty. Here, the van der Waals (vdW) epitaxial growth of a wafer&#8208;scale 2D platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) layer is reported via a simple tellurium&#8208;vapor transformation approach. The 2D PtTe2 layer possesses a unique mosaic&#8208;like crystal structure consisting of single&#8208;crystal domains with highly preferential [001] orientation along the normal direction, reducing the influence of interface defects and ensuring efficient out&#8208;of&#8208;plane carrier transportation. This characteristic, combined with the wide absorption of PtTe2 and well&#8208;designed vertical device architecture, makes the PtTe2/Si Schottky junction photodetector capable of sensing ultra&#8208;broadband light of up to 10.6 &#181;m with a high specific detectivity. Also, the photodetector exhibits an excellent room&#8208;temperature infrared&#8208;imaging capability. This approach provides a new design concept for high&#8208;performance, room&#8208;temperature MIR photodetection based on 2D layered materials.

      <title>Scalable Substitutional Re&#8208;Doping and its Impact on the Optical and Electronic Properties of Tungsten Diselenide</title>
      <dc:description>
Substitutional rhenium (Re) doping of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) films is achieved via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at front&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (FEOL) and back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line (BEOL) compatible temperatures, with the doping concentration of &lt;0.001%. Trion concentration is increased as a function of dopant concentration and discrete donor levels are observed that lie close to the conduction band confirming the n&#8208;type dopant nature of the rhenium atoms.








Abstract
Reliable, controlled doping of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides will enable the realization of next&#8208;generation electronic, logic&#8208;memory, and magnetic devices based on these materials. However, to date, accurate control over dopant concentration and scalability of the process remains a challenge. Here, a systematic study of scalable in situ doping of fully coalesced 2D WSe2 films with Re atoms via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition is reported. Dopant concentrations are uniformly distributed over the substrate surface, with precisely controlled concentrations down to &lt;0.001%&#160;Re achieved by tuning the precursor partial pressure. Moreover, the impact of doping on morphological, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of WSe2 is elucidated with detailed experimental and theoretical examinations, confirming that the substitutional doping of Re at the W site leads to n&#8208;type behavior of WSe2. Transport characteristics of fabricated back&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors are directly correlated to the dopant concentration, with degrading device performances for doping concentrations exceeding 1% of Re. The study demonstrates a viable approach to introducing true dopant&#8208;level impurities with high precision, which can be scaled up to batch production for applications beyond digital electronics.

      <title>Polymeric Membranes with Selective Solution&#8208;Diffusion for Intercepting Volatile Organic Compounds during Solar&#8208;Driven Water Remediation</title>
      <dc:description>
A micropyramid&#8208;structured PPy membrane with selective solution&#8208;diffusion effect is employed as the photothermal material for solar water purification. The membrane is successful in intercepting the evaporation of volatile organic molecules in wastewater. Furthermore, its high light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion efficiency and good mechanical strength make the membrane a promising photothermal material for practical solar water purification.








Abstract
Solar evaporation through a photothermal porous material provides a feasible and sustainable method for water remediation. Several photothermal materials have been developed to enhance solar evaporation efficiency. However, a critical limitation of current photothermal materials is their inability to separate water from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present in wastewater. Here, a microstructured ultrathin polymeric membrane that enables freshwater separation from VOC pollutants by solar evaporation with a VOC removal rate of 90%, is reported. The different solution&#8208;diffusion behaviors of water and VOCs with polymeric membranes facilitate their separation. Moreover, owing to increased light absorption, enlarged liquid&#8211;air interface, and shortened mass transfer distance, the microstructured and ultrathin configuration of the membrane helps to balance the tradeoff between permeation selectivity and water production capacity. The membrane is not only effective for evaporation of simulated volatile pollutants in a prototype, but can also intercept complex volatile organic contaminants in natural water sources and produce water that meets drinking&#8208;water standards. With practical demonstration and satisfactory purification performance, this work paves the way for practical application of solar evaporation for effective water remediation.

      <title>HASEL Artificial Muscles for a New Generation of Lifelike Robots&#8212;Recent Progress and Future Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators are a new, versatile class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles. Current research in materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and controls is discussed and the wide opportunities for future interdisciplinary research to realize HASEL artificial muscles with drastically improved performance for use as building blocks of bioinspired intelligent systems of the future are laid out.








Abstract
Future robots and intelligent systems will autonomously navigate in unstructured environments and closely collaborate with humans; integrated with our bodies and minds, they will allow us to surpass our physical limitations. Traditional robots are mostly built from rigid, metallic components and electromagnetic motors, which make them heavy, expensive, unsafe near people, and ill&#8208;suited for unpredictable environments. By contrast, biological organisms make extensive use of soft materials and radically outperform robots in terms of dexterity, agility, and adaptability. Particularly, natural muscle&#8212;a masterpiece of evolution&#8212;has long inspired researchers to create &#8220;artificial muscles&#8221; in an attempt to replicate its versatility, seamless integration with sensing, and ability to self&#8208;heal. To date, natural muscle remains unmatched in all&#8208;round performance, but rapid advancements in soft robotics have brought viable alternatives closer than ever. Herein, the recent development of hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a new class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles that couple electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve diverse modes of actuation, is discussed; current designs match or exceed natural muscle in many metrics. Research on materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and control systems for HASEL actuators is detailed. In each area, research opportunities are identified, which together lays out a roadmap for actuators with drastically improved performance. With their unique versatility and wide potential for further improvement, HASEL actuators are poised to play an important role in a paradigm shift that fundamentally challenges the current limitations of robotic hardware toward future intelligent systems that replicate the vast capabilities of biological organisms.

Traditional robots are mostly built from rigid, metallic components and electromagnetic motors, which make them heavy, expensive, unsafe near people, and ill&#8208;suited for unpredictable environments. By contrast, biological organisms make extensive use of soft materials and radically outperform robots in terms of dexterity, agility, and adaptability. Particularly, natural muscle&#8212;a masterpiece of evolution&#8212;has long inspired researchers to create &#8220;artificial muscles&#8221; in an attempt to replicate its versatility, seamless integration with sensing, and ability to self&#8208;heal. To date, natural muscle remains unmatched in all&#8208;round performance, but rapid advancements in soft robotics have brought viable alternatives closer than ever. Herein, the recent development of hydraulically amplified self&#8208;healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a new class of high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;sensing artificial muscles that couple electrostatic and hydraulic forces to achieve diverse modes of actuation, is discussed; current designs match or exceed natural muscle in many metrics. Research on materials, designs, fabrication, modeling, and control systems for HASEL actuators is detailed. In each area, research opportunities are identified, which together lays out a roadmap for actuators with drastically improved performance. With their unique versatility and wide potential for further improvement, HASEL actuators are poised to play an important role in a paradigm shift that fundamentally challenges the current limitations of robotic hardware toward future intelligent systems that replicate the vast capabilities of biological organisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Engineering Aptamer Switches for Multifunctional Stimulus&#8208;Responsive Nanosystems</title>
      <dc:description>
A comprehensive review of nucleic acid materials that can perform &#8220;switching&#8221; processes and achieve complex functions such as signaling or controlled payload release in response to external stimuli including light, pH, ligand&#8208;binding, and other microenvironmental cues is presented. The underlying mechanisms that enable such stimulus&#8208;driven responses, and strategies for engineering those functionalities into nanomaterials are described.








Abstract
Although RNA and DNA are best known for their capacity to encode biological information, it has become increasingly clear over the past few decades that these biomolecules are also capable of performing other complex functions, such as molecular recognition (e.g., aptamers) and catalysis (e.g., ribozymes). Building on these foundations, researchers have begun to exploit the predictable base&#8208;pairing properties of RNA and DNA in order to utilize nucleic acids as functional materials that can undergo a molecular &#8220;switching&#8221; process, performing complex functions such as signaling or controlled payload release in response to external stimuli including light, pH, ligand&#8208;binding and other microenvironmental cues. Although this field is still in its infancy, these efforts offer exciting potential for the development of biologically based &#8220;smart materials&#8221;. Herein, ongoing progress in the use of nucleic acids as an externally controllable switching material is reviewed. The diverse range of mechanisms that can trigger a stimulus response, and strategies for engineering those functionalities into nucleic acid materials are explored. Finally, recent progress is discussed in incorporating aptamer switches into more complex synthetic nucleic acid&#8208;based nanostructures and functionalized smart materials.

      <title>Preintercalation Strategy in Manganese Oxides for Electrochemical Energy Storage: Review and Prospects</title>
      <dc:description>
The intrinsic advantages and mechanisms of the preintercalation strategy in enhancing intrinsic conductivity, activating more active sites, promoting diffusion kinetics, and stabilizing structural integrity of MnO2 cathode materials are reviewed. Simultaneously, the current challenges for the preintercalation strategy for future research and development regarding the design of high&#8208;performance MnO2 cathodes for the next&#8208;generation batteries are discussed.








Abstract
Manganese oxides (MnO2) are promising cathode materials for various kinds of battery applications, including Li&#8208;ion, Na&#8208;ion, Mg&#8208;ion, and Zn&#8208;ion batteries, etc., due to their low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;capacity. However, the practical application of MnO2 cathodes has been restricted by some critical issues including low electronic conductivity, low utilization of discharge depth, sluggish diffusion kinetics, and structural instability upon cycling. Preintercalation of ions/molecules into the crystal structure with/without structural reconstruction provides essential optimizations to alleviate these issues. Here, the intrinsic advantages and mechanisms of the preintercalation strategy in enhancing electronic conductivity, activating more active sites, promoting diffusion kinetics, and stabilizing the structural integrity of MnO2 cathode materials are summarized. The current challenges related to the preintercalation strategy, along with prospects for the future research and development regarding its implementation in the design of high&#8208;performance MnO2 cathodes for the next&#8208;generation batteries are also discussed.

      <title>Biomimetic Diselenide&#8208;Bridged Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as an X&#8208;ray&#8208;Responsive Biodegradable Carrier for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
Biomimetic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles are tailored for radiation&#8208;responsive delivery of doxorubicin to solid tumors and are combined with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade as a chemo&#8208;immunotherapy. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiation, these cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanotherapeutics exhibit degradation&#8208;controlled drug release and induce anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, leading to enhanced tumor regression and metastasis inhibition with low systemic toxicity when combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Chemotherapy causes off&#8208;target toxicity and is often ineffective against solid tumors. Targeted and on&#8208;demand release of chemotherapeutics remains a challenge. Here, cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (MONs) containing X&#8208;ray&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive diselenide bonds for controlled release of doxorubicin (DOX) at tumor sites are developed. DOX&#8208;loaded MONs coated with 4T1 breast cancer cell membranes (CM@MON@DOX) show greater accumulation at tumor sites and prolonged blood circulation time versus an uncoated control in mice bearing 4T1 orthotopic mammary tumors. Under low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray radiation, the DOX&#8208;loaded MONs exhibit carrier degradation&#8208;controlled release via cleavage of diselenide bonds, resulting in DOX&#8208;mediated immunogenic cell death at the tumor site. Combination with a PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint blockade further enhances inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis with low systemic toxicity. Together, the findings show the promise of these biomimetic, radiation&#8208;responsive diselenide&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged MONs in chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Organic Solar Cells by Prolonging the Lifetime of Photogenerated Excitons</title>
      <dc:description>
9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) is utilized to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated excitons in a nonfullerene acceptor (IT&#8208;M) approximately twofold, ensuring longer exciton diffusion length and efficiency enhancement in organic photovoltaic devices. The prolongation arises from the first&#8208;discovered intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, thus suppressing the nonradiative decay.








Abstract
Exciton lifetime (&#964;) is crucial for the migration of excitons to donor/acceptor interfaces for subsequent charge separation in organic solar cells (OSCs); however, obvious prolongation of &#964; has rarely been achieved. Here, by introducing a solid additive 9&#8208;fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) into the active layer, which comprises a nonfullerene acceptor, 3,9&#8208;bis(2&#8208;methylene&#8208;((3&#8208;(1,1&#8208;dicyanomethylene)&#8208;6/7&#8208;methyl)&#8208;indanone))&#8208;5,5,11,11&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)&#8208;dithieno[2,3&#8208;d:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d&#8242;]&#8208;s&#8208;indaceno[1,2&#8208;b:5,6&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (IT&#8208;M), &#964; is substantially prolonged from 491 to 928 ps, together with obvious increases in fluorescence intensity and quantum yield. Time&#8208;resolved transient infrared spectra indicate the presence of an intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, which is first observed here and which can suppress the internal conversion process. IT&#8208;M&#8208;based OSCs display an improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor after the addition of FCA. Thus, the power conversion efficiency is increased, particularly for devices with a large donor/acceptor ratio of 1:4, whose efficiency is increased by 56%. This study describes a novel method, which is also applicable to other nonfullerene acceptors, for further improving the performance of OSCs without affecting their morphology and light absorption properties.

&lt;p&gt;9&#8208;Fluorenone&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (FCA) is utilized to prolong the lifetime of photogenerated excitons in a nonfullerene acceptor (IT&#8208;M) approximately twofold, ensuring longer exciton diffusion length and efficiency enhancement in organic photovoltaic devices. The prolongation arises from the first&#8208;discovered intermolecular vibrational coupling between the electronic excited state of IT&#8208;M and the electronic ground state of FCA, thus suppressing the nonradiative decay.

      <title>Spontaneously Splitting Copper Nanowires into Quantum Dots on Graphdiyne for Suppressing Lithium Dendrites</title>
      <dc:description>
The crystal structure of copper (Cu) impacts the growth of graphdiyne. As&#8208;grown graphdiyne splits Cu into quantum dots. Cu quantum dots on graphdiyne have high lithiophilicity to suppress lithium dendrites. This one&#8208;step method to produce Cu quantum dots on all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne can be used to develop many new&#8208;concept and high&#8208;activity catalysts for sustainable technologies.








Abstract
As an emerging carbon allotrope, the controllable growth of graphdiyne has been an important means to explore its unique scientific properties and applications. In this work, the effect of the crystal structure of copper (Cu) on the growth of graphdiyne is systematically studied. It is found that the crystal boundaries are the origin of the reaction activity. The polycrystalline Cu nanowire with many crystal boundaries is spontaneously split into Cu quantum dots (about 3&#160;nm) by the grown graphdiyne. These Cu quantum dots are uniformly dispersed on the graphdiyne, and they block the long&#8208;range ordered growth of the graphdiyne. These Cu quantum dots in situ supported on graphdiyne demonstrate high efficiency in inhibiting the growth of lithium dendrites in lithium metal batteries. Based on this interesting finding, the Cu quantum dots anchored on the all&#8208;carbon graphdiyne can be prepared on a large scale, and unique applications of Cu quantum dots in electrochemical fields can be implemented.

      <title>Reversibly Transforming a Highly Swollen Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel to an Extremely Tough One and its Application as a Tubular Grasper</title>
      <dc:description>
Reversible transformation of polyelectrolyte hydrogels between swollen, weak and collapsed, tough states is realized by formation and breaking up of robust metal&#8208;coordination complexes. The dramatic variations of the gels&#8217; volume and mechanical properties over 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude enable the design of a hydrogel&#8208;based tubular grasper with high holding force, i.e., thousand times its own weight, to grip objects with different geometries.








Abstract
Poly(2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid) and its copolymer hydrogels are typical polyelectrolyte gels with extremely high swelling capacity that are widely used in industry. It's common to consider these hydrogels as weak materials that are difficult to toughen. Reported here is a facile strategy to transform swollen and weak poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;2&#8208;acrylamido&#8208;2&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propanesulfonic acid) [P(AAm&#8208;co&#8208;AMPS)] hydrogels to tough ones by forming strong sulfonate&#8211;Zr4+ metal&#8208;coordination complexes. The resultant hydrogels with moderate water content possess high stiffness, strength, and fracture energy, which can be tuned over 3&#8211;4 orders of magnitude by controlling the composition and metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand ratio. Owing to the dynamic nature of the coordination bonds, these hydrogels show rate&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent mechanical performances, as well as good self&#8208;recovery properties. This strategy is universal, as manifested by the drastically improved mechanical properties of hydrogels of various natural and synthetic sulfonate&#8208;containing polymers. The toughened hydrogels can be converted to the original swollen ones by breaking up the metal&#8208;coordination complexes in alkaline solutions. The reversible brittle&#8211;tough transition and concomitant dramatic volume change of polyelectrolyte hydrogels afford diverse applications, as demonstrated by the design of a tubular grasper with holding force a thousand times its own weight for objects with different geometries. It is envisioned that these hydrogels enable versatile applications in the biomedical and engineering fields.

      <title>Synergistic Optimization Enables Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells to Maintain over 98% PCE of the Small&#8208;Area Rigid Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
With&#160;synergistic&#160;optimization of the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and processing temperature, large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells with high performance are achieved by the slot&#8208;die coating process. The 1 cm2 flexible devices produce an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.16%, and, for modules with an area of 25 cm2, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is generally regarded as the most effective large&#8208;scale methodology for the fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the corresponding device performance significantly lags behind spin&#8208;coated devices. Herein, the active layer morphology, flexible substrate properties, and the processing temperature are optimized synergistically to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE) for both the flexible single cells and the modules. As a result, the 1 cm2 flexible devices produce an excellent PCE of 12.16% as compared to 12.37% for the spin&#8208;coated small&#8208;area (0.04 cm2) rigid devices. Likewise, for modules with an area of 25 cm2, an extraordinary PCE of 10.09% is observed. Hence, efficiency losses associated with the upscaling are significantly reduced by the synergistic optimization. Moreover, after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 10&#160;mm, the flexible devices still produce over 99% of their initial PCE, whereas after being stored for over 6000 h in a glove box, the PCE reaches 103% of its initial value, indicating excellent device flexibility as well as superior shelf stability. These results, thus, are a promising confirmation the great potential for upscaling of large&#8208;area OSCs in the near future.

      <title>The Role of Demixing and Crystallization Kinetics on the Stability of Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Through investigation of the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of non&#8208;fullerene acceptor crystallization, the importance of diffusion coefficients and melting enthalpies in controlling the crystal growth rates, and that differences in halogenation can drastically change crystallization kinetics and device stability are revealed.








Abstract
With power conversion efficiency now over 17%, a long operational lifetime is essential for the successful application of organic solar cells. However, most non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can crystallize and destroy devices, yet the fundamental underlying thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of acceptor crystallization have received limited attention. Here, room&#8208;temperature (RT) diffusion coefficients of 3.4 &#215; 10&#8722;23 and 2.0 &#215; 10&#8722;22 are measured for ITIC&#8208;2Cl and ITIC&#8208;2F, two state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. The low coefficients are enough to provide for kinetic stabilization of the morphology against demixing at RT. Additionally profound differences in crystallization characteristics are discovered between ITIC&#8208;2F and ITIC&#8208;2Cl. The differences as observed by secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and microscopy can be related directly to device degradation and are attributed to the significantly different nucleation and growth rates, with a difference in the growth rate of a factor of 12 at RT. ITIC&#8208;4F and ITIC&#8208;4Cl exhibit similar characteristics. The results reveal the importance of diffusion coefficients and melting enthalpies in controlling the growth rates, and that differences in halogenation can drastically change crystallization kinetics and device stability. It is furthermore delineated how low nucleation density and large growth rates can be inferred from DSC and microscopy experiments which could be used to guide molecular design for stability.

      <title>Composite Nanostructure Construction on the Grain Surface of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides</title>
      <dc:description>
A composite nanostructure comprising a uniform LiTaO3 coating layer and the oriented growth of a spinel interlayer structure is constructed on the grain surface of Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) by the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique. The surface composite nanostructure modification can significantly improve the voltage maintenance, cycle stability, rate performance, and thermal stability of LLOs.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich layered oxides (LLOs) are fascinating high&#8208;energy cathodes for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but still suffer from critical drawbacks that retard their practical applications. Although surface modification is effective to protect LLOs from structural deterioration, the delicate design of structures on a grain surface with promising scalability for industrial application is still challenging. Herein, using the atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique, a composite nanostructure comprising a uniform LiTaO3 coating layer (&#8776;3 nm) and a spinel interlayer structure (&#8776;1 nm) is constructed on the grain surface of industrial LLO (Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2) agglomerated spheres. The surface composite nanostructure can not only enhance the structural/interfacial stability of the LLO, but also facilitates Li+ diffusion, thereby significantly improving its cycle stability, rate performance, thermal stability, and voltage maintenance. Specifically, the LLO coated with 10 ALD cycles exhibits a small voltage decay rate of 0.9 mV per cycle, a reversible capacity of 272.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C, and a capacity retention of 85% after 200 cycles at 1 C, suggesting the important role of surface composite nanostructure for improving the electrochemical performance. This work provides new insights into the composite nanostructure design on the grain surface of cathode materials for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

      <title>Preferentially Engineering FeN4 Edge Sites onto Graphitic Nanosheets for Highly Active and Durable Oxygen Electrocatalysis in Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Edge&#8208;enriched FeN4 site integration into the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture is developed for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries. Benefiting from the structural merits, the as&#8208;developed catalyst displays impressive performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.78&#160;V and long&#8208;term cyclability for over 240 cycles.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom FeN4 sites at the edges of carbon substrates are considered more active for oxygen electrocatalysis than those in plane; however, the conventional high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis process does not allow for precisely engineering the location of the active site down to atomic level. Enlightened by theoretical prediction, herein, a self&#8208;sacrificed templating approach is developed to obtain edge&#8208;enriched FeN4 sites integrated in the highly graphitic nanosheet architecture. The in situ formed Fe clusters are intentionally introduced to catalyze the growth of graphitic carbon, induce porous structure formation, and most importantly, facilitate the preferential anchoring of FeN4 to its close approximation. Due to these attributes, the as&#8208;resulted catalyst (denoted as Fe/N&#8208;G&#8208;SAC) demonstrates unprecedented catalytic activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by showing an impressive half&#8208;wave potential of 0.89&#160;V for the ORR and a small overpotential of 370&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the OER. Moreover, the Fe/N&#8208;G&#8208;SAC cathode displays encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with a low charge&#8211;discharge voltage gap of 0.78&#160;V and long&#8208;term cyclability for over 240 cycles, outperforming the noble metal benchmarks.

      <title>Structural Insight in the Interfacial Effect in Ferroelectric Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
Using atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy together with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase field simulations, a spatial structure analysis of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites is provided. The unprecedented insights into the interfacial coupling effect at the molecular level would enable interfacial engineering strategies to realize improved properties and unlock new functionalities of the nanocomposites.








Abstract
Both experimental results and theoretical models suggest the decisive role of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces on the dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and electrocaloric properties of ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites. However, there remains a lack of direct structural evidence to support the so&#8208;called interfacial effect in dielectric nanocomposites. Here, a chemical mapping of the interfacial coupling between the nanofiller and the polymer matrix in ferroelectric polymer nanocomposites by combining atomic force microscopy&#8211;infrared spectroscopy (AFM&#8211;IR) with first&#8208;principles calculations and phase&#8208;field simulations is provided. The addition of ceramic fillers into a ferroelectric polymer leads to augmentation of the local conformational disorder in the vicinity of the interface, resulting in the local stabilization of the all&#8208;trans conformation (i.e., the polar &#946; phase). The formation of highly polar and inhomogeneous interfacial regions, which is further enhanced with a decrease of the filler size, has been identified experimentally and verified by phase&#8208;field simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work offers unprecedented structural insights into the configurational disorder&#8208;induced interfacial effect and will enable rational design and molecular engineering of the filler&#8211;matrix interfaces of electroactive polymer nanocomposites to boost their collective properties.

      <title>Nanomaterials with Supramolecular Assembly Based on AIE Luminogens for Theranostic Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanotheranostics, constructed from aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens via supramolecular assembly, have been extensively studied during the past decades and exhibit great potential in personalized and precision medicine. This advanced strategy also facilitates the development of integrated systems combining diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
One of the major pursuits of biomedical science is to develop advanced strategies for theranostics, which is expected to be an effective approach for achieving the transition from conventional medicine to precision medicine. Supramolecular assembly can serve as a powerful tool in the development of nanotheranostics with accurate imaging of tumors and real&#8208;time monitoring of the therapeutic process upon the incorporation of aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) ability. AIE luminogens (AIEgens) will not only enable fluorescence imaging but will also aid in improving the efficacy of therapies. Furthermore, the fluorescent signals and therapeutic performance of these nanomaterials can be manipulated precisely owing to the reversible and stimuli&#8208;responsive characteristics of the supramolecular systems. Inspired by rapid advances in this field, recent research conducted on nanotheranostics with the AIE effect based on supramolecular assembly is summarized. Here, three representative strategies for supramolecular nanomaterials are presented as follows: a) supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of AIEgens, b) the loading of AIEgens within nanocarriers with supramolecular assembly, and c) supramolecular macrocycle&#8208;guided assembly via host&#8211;guest interactions. Meanwhile, the diverse applications of such nanomaterials in diagnostics and therapeutics have also been discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges of this field are listed in this review.

      <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Photocatalysts Optimized by Spatially Separated Cocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
A heterostructured photocatalyst, Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (PUM), is constructed based on the rational optimization of NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 with spatially separated Pt and MnOx nanoparticles as cocatalysts. The optimization results in a long lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes in the composite, which can drive overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents.








Abstract
Efficient charge separation and utilization are critical factors in photocatalysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that the complete spatial separation of oxidation and reduction cocatalysts enhances the efficacy of charge separation and surface reaction. Specifically, a Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (PUM) heterostructured photocatalyst with Pt and MnOx as cocatalysts is designed for the optimization of the NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 photocatalyst. Compared with the pristine NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, Pt@NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66 (PU), and NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@MnOx (UM) samples, the PUM sample exhibits the highest hydrogen production activity. As cocatalysts, Pt favors trapping of electrons, while MnOx tends to collect holes. Upon generation from NH2&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, electrons and holes flow inward and outward of the metal&#8211;organic framework photocatalyst, accumulating on the corresponding cocatalysts, and then take part in the redox reactions. The PUM photocatalyst greatly prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which favors the electron&#8211;hole separation. Furthermore, the PUM sample facilitates overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents, thereby demonstrating its potential as a modification method of MOF&#8208;type semiconductors for the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (UM) samples, the PUM sample exhibits the highest hydrogen production activity. As cocatalysts, Pt favors trapping of electrons, while MnO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; tends to collect holes. Upon generation from NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;UiO&#8208;66, electrons and holes flow inward and outward of the metal&#8211;organic framework photocatalyst, accumulating on the corresponding cocatalysts, and then take part in the redox reactions. The PUM photocatalyst greatly prolongs the lifetime of the photogenerated electrons and holes, which favors the electron&#8211;hole separation. Furthermore, the PUM sample facilitates overall water splitting in the absence of sacrificial agents, thereby demonstrating its potential as a modification method of MOF&#8208;type semiconductors for the overall water&#8208;splitting reaction.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Designing Advanced In Situ Electrode/Electrolyte Interphases for Wide Temperature Operation of 4.5 V Li||LiCoO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
High&#8208;voltage LiCoO2 cathodes are highly desirable for various energy&#8208;storage applications, especially when coupled with lithium metal anodes. Fluorine&#8208;rich electrode/electrolyte interphases in situ formed in an advanced ether electrolyte is found to enable highly stable cell cycling under elevated temperatures. Those interphases effectively suppress electrolyte side reactions and preserve the integrity of both cathode and anode materials.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode are of significant importance to the energy&#8208;storage market, especially for portable electronics. However, their development is greatly limited by the inferior performance under high voltages and challenging temperatures. Here, highly stable lithium (Li) metal batteries with LCO cathode, through the design of in situ formed, stable electrode/electrolyte interphases on both the Li anode and the LCO cathode, with an advanced electrolyte, are reported. The LCO cathode can deliver a high specific capacity of &#8776;190 mAh g&#8722;1 and show greatly improved cell performances under a high charge voltage of 4.5&#160;V (even up to 4.55&#160;V) and a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 55&#160;&#176;C. This work points out a promising approach for developing Li||LCO batteries for practical applications. This approach can also be used to improve the high&#8208;voltage performance of other batteries in a broad temperature range.

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Molecular Packing Explain Performance and Processing Procedures of Three D18:NFA Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular packing and thermodynamic properties of D18&#8208;based fullerene&#8208;free organic solar cells are studied. The D18 polymer exhibits strong chain extension in films, which is beneficial to charge transport. Miscibility and other characterizations explain the disparate performance of three systems and the processing procedures.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on D18:Y6 have recently exhibited a record power conversion efficiency of over 18%. The initial work is extended and the device performance of D18&#8208;based OSCs is compared with three non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, Y6, IT&#8208;4F, and IEICO&#8208;4Cl, and their molecular packing characteristics and miscibility are studied. The D18 polymer shows unusually strong chain extension and excellent backbone ordering in all films, which likely contributes to the excellent hole&#8208;transporting properties. Thermodynamic characterization indicates a room&#8208;temperature miscibility for D18:Y6 and D18:IT&#8208;4F near the percolation threshold. This corresponds to an ideal quench depth and explains the use of solvent vapor annealing rather than thermal annealing. In contrast, D18:IEICO&#8208;4Cl is a low&#8208;miscibility system with a deep quench depth during casting and poor morphology control and low performance. A failure of ternary blends with PC71BM is likely due to the near&#8208;ideal miscibility of Y6 to begin with and indicates that strategies for developing successful ternary or quaternary solar cells are likely very different for D18 than for other high&#8208;performing donors. This work reveals several unique property&#8211;performance relations of D18&#8208;based photovoltaic devices and helps guide design or fabrication of yet higher efficiency OSCs.

      <dc:description>
A simple, adaptable polyphenol&#8208;based molecular engineering platform &#8220;Cellnex&#8221; is reported as a rapid and efficient approach to functionalize cell surfaces with biomolecules. This platform enables the customized engineering of a wide range of mammalian cells with diverse classes of biomolecules.

Abstract
Approaches to safely and effectively augment cellular functions without compromising the inherent biological properties of the cells, especially through the integration of biologically labile domains, remain of great interest. Here, a versatile strategy to assemble biologically active nanocomplexes, including proteins, DNA, mRNA, and even viral carriers, on cellular surfaces to generate a cell&#8208;based hybrid system referred to as &#8220;Cellnex&#8221; is established. This strategy can be used to engineer a wide range of cell types used in adoptive cell transfers, including erythrocytes, macrophages, NK cells, T cells, etc. Erythrocytenex can enhance the delivery of cargo proteins to the lungs in vivo by 11&#8208;fold as compared to the free cargo counterpart. Biomimetic microfluidic experiments and modeling provided detailed insights into the targeting mechanism. In addition, Macrophagenex is capable of enhancing the therapeutic efficiency of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 checkpoint inhibitors in vivo. This simple and adaptable approach may offer a platform for the rapid generation of complex cellular systems.

      <title>100 m Long Thermally Drawn Supercapacitor Fibers with Applications to 3D Printing and Textiles</title>
      <dc:description>
A flow&#8208;based preform&#8208;to&#8208;fiber (top&#8208;down) thermal drawing process is used in which a preform of macroscale dimensions, assembled with all the five component materials, is thermally drawn into 100 m lengths of fully functional supercapacitor fiber. The cell architecture is designed to address the mechanical, environmental, electrical, and storage requirements of a textile and 3D printed energy&#8208;storage device.








Abstract
Supercapacitor fibers, with short charging times, long cycle lifespans, and high power densities, hold promise for powering flexible fabric&#8208;based electronics. To date, however, only short lengths of functioning fiber supercapacitors have been produced. The primary goal of this study is to introduce a supercapacitor fiber that addresses the remaining challenges of scalability, flexibility, cladding impermeability, and performance at length. This is achieved through a top&#8208;down fabrication method in which a macroscale preform is thermally drawn into a fully functional energy&#8208;storage fiber. The preform consists of five components: thermally reversible porous electrode and electrolyte gels; conductive polymer and copper microwire current collectors; and an encapsulating hermetic cladding. This process produces 100 m of continuous functional supercapacitor fiber, orders of magnitude longer than any previously reported. In addition to flexibility (5 mm radius of curvature), moisture resistance (100 washing cycles), and strength (68&#160;MPa), these fibers have an energy density of 306 &#956;Wh cm&#8722;2 at 3.0&#160;V and &#8776;100% capacitance retention over 13&#160;000 cycles at 1.6&#160;V. To demonstrate the utility of this fiber, it is machine&#8208;woven and used as filament for 3D printing.

Multicolor afterglow nanoparticles (AGNPs) are synthesized via a straightforward template method. Such multicolor AGNPs exhibit a series of tunable afterglow emissions, including blue, yellow, green, and white.

Afterglow nanoparticles (AGNPs) possessing inherently long lifetime with tailorable emission colors and uniform size have long been sought due to their time&#8208;gating&#8208;free high&#8208;contrast multiplexing imaging. Herein, via a straightforward template method, it is reported that such multicolor AGNPs can be accomplished. The resultant AGNPs exhibit a series of tunable afterglow emissions, including blue, yellow, green, and white. These multicolor AGNPs are found to be highly bright, enabling them to perform high&#8208;contrast multichannel afterglow imaging in vitro and in vivo without the use of any complicated time&#8208;gating algorithms or systems, which existing tools are unable to do.

      <title>Visualizing Tailored Spin Phenomena in a Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Topological Superlattice</title>
      <dc:description>
Topological states with tailored spin phenomena are realized in a reduced&#8208;dimensional superlattice structure, (&#9633;/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N or Bi2/Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N (N is the repeating unit) by controlling different terminations via molecular beam epitaxy. This work suggests a promising route of engineering topological superlattices for efficient spin&#8211;charge transducers and long&#8208;lived spin transport spintronic applications.








Abstract
Emergent topological insulators (TIs) and their design are in high demand for manipulating and transmitting spin information toward ultralow&#8208;power&#8208;consumption spintronic applications. Here, distinct topological states with tailored spin properties can be achieved in a single reduced&#8208;dimensional TI&#8208;superlattice, (Bi2/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N or (&#9633;/Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N (N is the repeating unit, &#9633; represents an empty layer) by controlling the termination via molecular beam epitaxy. The Bi2&#8208;terminated superlattice exhibits a single Dirac cone with a spin momentum splitting &#8776;0.5 &#197;&#8722;1, producing a pronounced inverse Edelstein effect with a coherence length up to 1.26&#160;nm. In contrast, the Bi2Se3&#8208;terminated superlattice is identified as a dual TI protected by coexisting time reversal and mirror symmetries, showing an unexpectedly long spin lifetime up to 1&#160;ns. The work elucidates the key role of dimensionality and dual topological phases in selecting desired spin properties, suggesting a promise route for engineering topological superlattices for high&#8208;performance TI&#8208;spintronic devices.

      <title>Charge&#8211;Ferroelectric Transition in Ultrathin Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 Flakes Probed via a Dual&#8208;Gated Full van der Waals Transistor</title>
      <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gated MoS2 ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor in full van der Waals structure is demonstrated with a thin Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 flake as the ferroelectric gate dielectric. Hysteresis behaviors can be electrostatically controlled by dual&#8208;gating from charge dynamic (clockwise) to ferroelectric (counterclockwise). This allows a multi&#8208;functional device with its operation switchable from short&#8208;term memory to nonvolatile ferroelectric memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) have recently attracted enormous attention owing to their applications in nonvolatile memories and low&#8208;power logic electronics. However, the current mainstream thin&#8208;film&#8208;based ferroelectrics lack good compatibility with the emergent 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In this work, the synthesis of thin ferroelectric Na0.5Bi4.5Ti4O15 (NBIT) flakes by a molten&#8208;salt method is reported. With a dry&#8208;transferred NBIT flake serving as the top&#8208;gate dielectric, dual&#8208;gate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FeFETs are fabricated in a full vdW stacking structure. Barrier&#8208;free graphene contacts allow the investigation of intrinsic carrier transport of MoS2 governed by lattice scattering. Thanks to the high dielectric constant of &#8776;94 in NBIT, a metal to insulator transition with a high electron concentration of 3.0 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2 is achieved in MoS2 under top&#8208;gate modulation. The electron field&#8208;effect mobility as high as 182 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 88 K is obtained. The as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 FeFET exhibits clockwise hysteresis transfer curves that originate from charge trapping/release with either top&#8208;gate or back&#8208;gate modulation. Interestingly, hysteresis behavior can be controlled from clockwise to counterclockwise using dual&#8208;gate. A multifunctional device utilizing this unique property of NBIT, which is switchable electrostatically between short&#8208;term memory and nonvolatile ferroelectric memory, is envisaged.

      <title>Criteria for Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Electrical Transport Applications of Topological Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
What does it take to make a room&#8208;temperature electronic device based on the unusual states found in topological materials? As shown here, the answer is a materials&#8208;redesign, which delicately balances bandgap, dielectric constant, and effective mass. Identifying this new generation of materials can pave the way to realistic quantum technologies.








Abstract
The unusual electronic states found in topological materials can enable a new generation of devices and technologies, yet a long&#8208;standing challenge has been finding materials without deleterious parallel bulk conduction. This can arise either from defects or thermally activated carriers. Here, the criteria that materials need to meet to realize transport properties dominated by the topological states, a necessity for a topological device, are clarified. This is demonstrated for 3D topological insulators, 3D Dirac materials, and 1D quantum anomalous Hall insulators, though this can be applied to similar systems. The key parameters are electronic bandgap, dielectric constant, and carrier effective mass, which dictate under what circumstances (defect density, temperature, etc.) the unwanted bulk state will conduct in parallel to the topological states. As these are fundamentally determined by the basic atomic properties, simple chemical arguments can be used to navigate the phase space to ultimately find improved materials. This will enable rapid identification of new systems with improved properties, which is crucial to designing new material systems and push a new generation of topological technologies.

      <title>Photocatalysts: Steering Hollow Multishelled Structures in Photocatalysis: Optimizing Surface and Mass Transport (Adv. Mater. 44/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2002556, Shouhua Feng, Dan Wang, and co&#8208;workers give an overview of rational design to elevate the photocatalytic performance of hollow multishelled structures (HoMSs) by surface and mass&#8208;transfer optimization. Enlarged effective surface areas and the boosted mass transport in HoMSs greatly favor the energy/mass transfer processes in photocatalysis. In addition, specific structural and compositional parameters affecting photocatalytic performance are described, along with proposed guidance for the development directions of HoMS photocatalysts.

      <title>Stable Potassium Metal Anodes with an All&#8208;Aluminum Current Collector through Improved Electrolyte Wetting</title>
      <dc:description>
Dendrite&#8208;free electrochemical cycling of potassium metal anodes is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting on a geometrically rough all&#8208;aluminum current collector. The electrolyte was standard potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane and no modifications were made to the collector surface chemistry. The key takeaway from this study is that good electrolyte wetting is necessary for stable plating/stripping, with poor wetting ensuring instability and dendrite growth.








Abstract
This is the first report of successful potassium metal battery anode cycling with an aluminum&#8208;based rather than copper&#8208;based current collector. Dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping is achieved through improved electrolyte wetting, employing an aluminum&#8208;powder&#8208;coated aluminum foil &#8220;Al@Al,&#8221; without any modification of the support surface chemistry or electrolyte additives. The reservoir&#8208;free Al@Al half&#8208;cell is stable at 1000 cycles (1950&#160;h) at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 98.9% cycling Coulombic efficiency and 0.085&#160;V overpotential. The pre&#8208;potassiated cell is stable through a wide current range, including 130&#160;cycles (2600 min) at 3.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with 0.178&#160;V overpotential. Al@Al is fully wetted by a 4 m potassium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide&#8208;dimethoxyethane electrolyte (&#952;CA&#160;= 0&#176;), producing a uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) during the initial galvanostatic formation cycles. On planar aluminum foil with a nearly identical surface oxide, the electrolyte wets poorly (&#952;CA&#160;= 52&#176;). This correlates with coarse irregular SEI clumps at formation, 3D potassium islands with further SEI coarsening during plating/stripping, possibly dead potassium metal on stripped surfaces, and rapid failure. The electrochemical stability of Al@Al versus planar Al is not related to differences in potassiophilicity (nearly identical) as obtained from thermal wetting experiments. Planar Cu foils are also poorly electrolyte&#8208;wetted and become dendritic. The key fundamental takeaway is that the incomplete electrolyte wetting of collectors results in early onset of SEI instability and dendrites.

      <title>Lattice&#8208;Distortion&#8208;Enhanced Yield Strength in a Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
      <dc:description>
The lattice distortions of the NbTaTiV and NbTaTiVZr refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are quantitatively calculated and measured by various techniques. The relationship between the lattice distortion and yield strength is clearly demonstrated by the addition of Zr elements in an NbTaTiV HEA, resulting in an enhanced yield strength due to the increased lattice distortion.








Abstract
Severe distortion is one of the four core effects in single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) and contributes significantly to the yield strength. However, the connection between the atomic&#8208;scale lattice distortion and macro&#8208;scale mechanical properties through experimental verification has yet to be fully achieved, owing to two critical challenges: 1) the difficulty in the development of homogeneous single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution HEAs and 2) the ambiguity in describing the lattice distortion and related measurements and calculations. A single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) refractory HEA, NbTaTiVZr, using thermodynamic modeling coupled with experimental verifications, is developed. Compared to the previously developed single&#8208;phase NbTaTiV HEA, the NbTaTiVZr HEA shows a higher yield strength and comparable plasticity. The increase in yield strength is systematically and quantitatively studied in terms of lattice distortion using a theoretical model, first&#8208;principles calculations, synchrotron X&#8208;ray/neutron diffraction, atom&#8208;probe tomography, and scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques. These results demonstrate that severe lattice distortion is a core factor for developing high strengths in refractory HEAs.

&lt;p&gt;The lattice distortions of the NbTaTiV and NbTaTiVZr refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) are quantitatively calculated and measured by various techniques. The relationship between the lattice distortion and yield strength is clearly demonstrated by the addition of Zr elements in an NbTaTiV HEA, resulting in an enhanced yield strength due to the increased lattice distortion.

      <title>Periodic Wrinkle&#8208;Patterned Single&#8208;Crystalline Ferroelectric Oxide Membranes with Enhanced Piezoelectricity</title>
      <dc:description>
Freestanding BaTiO3 membranes (ferroelastic oxides) and poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer (organism) are combined to construct a periodically wrinkled structure. The wrinkle&#8208;patterned ferroelectric membranes offer an ideal platform to explore strain&#8208;correlated fundamental phenomena such as flexoelectricity, strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric domain evolutions, and phase transitions, as well as the periodic electric potential induced functions in flexible optical and electrical devices.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled membranes with periodic wrinkled patterns are the critical building blocks of various flexible electronics, where the wrinkles are usually designed and fabricated to provide distinct functionalities. These membranes are typically metallic and organic materials with good ductility that are tolerant of complex deformation. However, the preparation of oxide membranes, especially those with intricate wrinkle patterns, is challenging due to their inherently strong covalent or ionic bonding, which usually leads to material crazing and brittle fracture. Here, wrinkle&#8208;patterned BaTiO3 (BTO)/poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes with finely controlled parallel, zigzag, and mosaic patterns are prepared. The BTO layers show excellent flexibility and can form well&#8208;ordered and periodic wrinkles under compressive in&#8208;plane stress. Enhanced piezoelectricity is observed at the sites of peaks and valleys of the wrinkles where the largest strain gradient is generated. Atomistic simulations further reveal that the excellent elasticity and the correlated coupling between polarization and strain/strain gradient are strongly associated with ferroelectric domain switching and continuous dipole rotation. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is primarily generated at compressive regions, while the in&#8208;plane polarization dominates at the tensile regions. The wrinkled ferroelectric oxides with differently strained regions and correlated polarization distributions would pave a way toward novel flexible electronics.

      <title>Discovering Electron&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Driven Changes in Chemical Bonding in Lead Chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S, O)</title>
      <dc:description>
Systematic changes of chemical bonding are studied in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O) to comprehend their properties. The exploration reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X&#160;=&#160;Te,&#160;Se,&#160;S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. The insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.








Abstract
Understanding the nature of chemical bonding in solids is crucial to comprehend the physical and chemical properties of a given compound. To explore changes in chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X&#160;= Te, Se, S, O), a combination of property&#8208;, bond&#8208;breaking&#8208;, and quantum&#8208;mechanical bonding descriptors are applied. The outcome of the explorations reveals an electron&#8208;transfer&#8208;driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X = Te, Se, S) to iono&#8208;covalent bonding in &#946;&#8208;PbO. Metavalent bonding is characterized by adjacent atoms being held together by sharing about a single electron (ES &#8776; 1) and small electron transfer (ET). The transition from metavalent to iono&#8208;covalent bonding manifests itself in clear changes in these quantum&#8208;mechanical descriptors (ES and ET), as well as in property&#8208;based descriptors (i.e., Born effective charge (Z*), dielectric function &#949;(&#969;), effective coordination number (ECoN), and mode&#8208;specific Gr&#252;neisen parameter (&#947;TO)), and in bond&#8208;breaking descriptors. Metavalent bonding collapses if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores (ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree of electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor material properties such as the chemical bond (Z*) and electronic (&#949;&#8734;) polarizability, optical bandgap, and optical interband transitions characterized by &#949;2(&#969;). Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential for materials design.
