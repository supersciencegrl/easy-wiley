         <title>Pyridinic Nitrogen Sites Dominated Coordinative Engineering of Subnanometric Pd Clusters for Efficient Alkynes Semi&#8208;hydrogenation</title>

Abstract
Supported metal catalysts have played an important role in optimizing selective semi&#8208;hydrogenation of alkynes for fine chemicals. Thereinto, nitrogen&#8208;doped carbons, as a type of promising support materials, have attracted extensive attentions. However, due to the general phenomenon of random doping for nitrogen species in the support, it is still a tremendous challenge to finely identify which nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic property of alkynes semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Herein, we report that uniform mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon spheres derived from mesoporous polypyrrole spheres are used as supports to immobilized subnanometric Pd clusters, which provides a particular platform to research the influence of nitrogen configurations on the alkynes semi&#8208;hydrogenation. Comprehensive experimental results and DFT calculation indicate that pyridinic nitrogen configuration dominates the catalytic behavior of Pd clusters. The high contents of pyridinic nitrogen sites offer abundant coordination sites to them, which greatly reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining reaction step and makes Pd clusters own high catalytic activity. The electronic effect between pyridinic nitrogen sites and Pd clusters enables Pd to possess a high catalytic selectivity. Additionally, the good mesostructures also promote the fast transport of substrate. Based on the above, catalyst Pd@PPy&#8208;600 exhibits high catalytic activity (99%) and selectivity (96%) for phenylacetylene semi&#8208;hydrogenation.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Light&#8208;Fueled Nonreciprocal Self&#8208;Oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;equilibrium self&#8208;sustained motions are widely reported in stimuli&#8208;responsive material systems. Here, a cilia&#8208;like&#160;soft actuator that can perform self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water, with programmable nonreciprocal strokes, is demonstrated. The self&#8208;oscillators can realize microfluidic pumping, translocation of a micro&#8208;object, and coupling between two non&#8208;equilibrium material pieces through fluidic interaction in an autonomous manner.








Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, an optically powered soft material strip that can perform nonreciprocal, cilia&#8208;like,&#160;self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water is reported. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield nonreciprocal strokes. The nonreciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. Autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction are demonstrated. The results offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unusual spectrally reproducible near-IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q-factor as high as &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn-based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triplet Fusion Upconversion for Photocuring 3D Printed Particle&#8208;Reinforced Composite Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High energy photons (&#955;&lt;400&#160;nm) are frequently used to initiate free radical polymerizations to form polymer networks, but are only effective for transparent objects. This phenomenon poses a major challenge to additive manufacturing of particle&#8208;reinforced composite networks since deep light penetration of short&#8208;wavelength photons limits the homogeneous modification of physicochemical and mechanical properties. Herein, we employ the unconventional, yet versatile multiexciton process of triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation upconversion (TTA&#8208;UC) for curing opaque hydrogel composites created by direct&#8208;ink&#8208;write (DIW) 3D printing. TTA&#8208;UC converts low&#8208;energy red light (&#955;max = 660&#160;nm) for deep penetration into higher&#8208;energy blue light to initiate free radical polymerizations within opaque objects. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, hydrogels containing up to 15 wt% TiO2 filler particles and doped with TTA&#8208;UC chromophores were readily cured with red light, while composites without the chromophores and TiO2 loadings as little as 1&#8211;2 wt% remained uncured. Importantly, this method has wide potential to modify the chemical and mechanical properties of complex DIW 3D printed composite polymer networks.

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh/g with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh/g during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Plant Derived Vesicle&#8208;Like Nanoparticles as Promising Biotherapeutic Tools: Present and Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous, phospholipid bilayer&#8208;enclosed biological particles that regulate cell communication by molecular cargo delivery and surface signaling. EVs are secreted by almost all living cells, including plant cells. Plant&#8208;derived vesicle&#8208;like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) are a generic term referring to vesicle&#8208;like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering human body systems and delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influences on human health and diseases. In this review, we introduce the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs, and how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability. We then systematically discuss the potential applications of PDVLNs on different plant and mammalian diseases and PDVLN research standardization.

Plant-derived vesicle-like nanoparticles (PDVLNs) are a generic term referring to vesicle-like nanostructure particles isolated from plants. Their low immunogenicity and wide availability make PDVLNs safer and more economical to be developed as therapeutic agents and drug carriers. Accumulating evidence indicates the key roles of PDVLNs in regulating interkingdom crosstalk between humans and plants. PDVLNs are capable of entering human body systems and delivering effector molecules to cells that modulate cell signaling pathways. PDVLNs released by or obtained from plants thus have great influences on human health and diseases. In this review, we introduce the biogenesis, detailed preparation methods, various physical and biochemical characteristics, biosafety, and preservation of PDVLNs, and how these characteristics pertain to their biosafety and preservability. We then systematically discuss the potential applications of PDVLNs on different plant and mammalian diseases and PDVLN research standardization.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of owning seductive features differentiating from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains endowing them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows to manipulate the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate (SO) dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure could be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology could realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol (HA), which was unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrated good biocompatibility, but also exhibited splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;wavelength Light&#8208;responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultra&#8208;violet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>4D Printed Soft and Stretchable Self&#8208;folding Cuff Electrodes for Small&#8208;nerve Interfacing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Peripheral nerve interfacing (PNI) has a high clinical potential for treating various diseases, like obesity or diabetes. However, currently existing electrodes present challenges to the interfacing procedure, which limits their clinical application, in particular, when targeting small peripheral nerves (&lt; 200&#160;&#956;m). To improve the electrode handling and implantation, we fabricate a nerve interface that can fold itself to a cuff around a small nerve, triggered by the body moisture during insertion. We achieve this folding by printing a bilayer of a flexible polyurethane printing resin and a highly swelling sodium acrylate hydrogel using photopolymerization. When immersed in an aqueous liquid, the hydrogel swells and folds the electrode softly around the nerve. Furthermore, the electrodes are robust, can be stretched (&gt; 20%), and bend to facilitate the implantation due to the use of soft and stretchable printing resins as substrates and a microcracked gold film as conductive layer. We demonstrate the straightforward implantation and extraction of the electrode as well as stimulation and recording capabilities on a small peripheral nerve in vivo. We believe that such simple and robust to use self&#8208;folding electrodes will pave the way for bringing PNI to a broader clinical application.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least 3 times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 Monitoring at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative self&#8208;powered room&#8208;temperature nitrogen dioxide (NO2) sensor based on an indium phosphide homojunction nanowire array is presented. The proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept sensor structure, with high sensitivity, stability, and selectivity, is demonstrated. It is integrated to&#160;a USB interface for on&#8208;field vehicle&#8208;exhaust measurement. This work promises a new family of self&#8208;powered sensors made of III&#8211;V compound semiconductor nanostructures, for future mega&#8208;scale Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things systems.








Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand for self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8211;i&#8211;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device is designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor is integrated into a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. The results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Tuning the Color of Photonic Glass Pigments by Thermal Annealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of porous bottlebrush block copolymer microparticles enables their coloration to be tuned from blue through to red, without significant loss of structural fidelity. This process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the polymer matrix and the absence of microphase separation. Applying thermal annealing as a post&#8208;process enables the production of thermochromic patterned hydrogels.








Abstract
Thermal or solvent annealing is commonly employed to enhance phase separation and remove defects in block copolymer (BCP) films, leading to well&#8208;resolved nanostructures. Annealing is of particular importance for photonic BCP materials, where large, well&#8208;ordered lamellar domains are required to generate strong reflections at visible wavelengths. However, such strategies have not been considered for porous BCP systems, such as inverse photonic glasses, where the structure (and thus the optical response) is no longer defined solely by the chemical compatibility of the blocks, but by the size and arrangement of voids within the BCP matrix. In this study, a demonstration of how the concept of &#8220;thermal annealing&#8221; can be applied to bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) microparticles with a photonic glass architecture is presented, enabling their coloration to be tuned from blue to red. By comparing biocompatible BBCPs with similar composition, but different thermal behavior, it is shown that this process is driven by both a temperature&#8208;induced softening of the BBCP matrix (i.e., polymer mobility) and the absence of microphase separation (enabling diffusion&#8208;induced swelling of the pores). Last, this concept is applied toward the production of a thermochromic patterned hydrogel, exemplifying the potential of such responsive biocompatible photonic&#8208;glass pigments toward smart labeling or anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

Hence, all-polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all-polymer OPV cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Highly Active, Long&#8208;lived Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalyst Derived from Open&#8208;framework Iridates</title>

Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction underpins several important electrical&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversions, and this energy&#8208;intensive process relies industrially on iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here we present phase&#8208;selective synthesis of metastable strontium iridates with open&#8208;framework structure and their unexpected transformation into a highly active, ultrastable oxygen evolution nano&#8208;electrocatalyst. This transformation involves two major steps: Sr2+/H+ ion exchange in acid and in situ structural rearrangement under electrocatalysis conditions. Unlike its dense perovskite&#8208;structured polymorphs, the open&#8208;framework iridates have the ability to undergo rapid proton exchange in acid without framework amorphization. And the resulting protonated iridates further reconstruct into ultrasmall, surface&#8208;hydroxylated, (200) crystal plane&#8208;oriented rutile nanocatalyst, instead of common amorphous IrOxHy phase, during acidic oxygen evolution. Such microstructural characteristics are found to benefit both the oxidation of hydroxyls and the formation of O&#8208;O bonds in electrocatalytic cycle. As a result, the open&#8208;framework iridate&#8208;derived nanocatalyst gives a comparable catalytic activity to the most active iridium&#8208;based oxygen evolution electrocatalysts in acid, and retains its catalytic activity for more than 1,000 hours.

         <title>Backbone Engineering Enables Highly Efficient Polymer Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
The interface and crystallinity of perovskite films play a decisive role in determining the device performance, which is significantly influenced by the bottom hole&#8208;transporting material (HTM) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, this work reports a simple design strategy of polymer HTMs, which can modulate the wettability and promote the anchoring by introducing pyridine units into the polyarylamine backbone, so as to realize efficient and stable inverted PVSCs. The HTM properties can be effectively modified by varying the linkage sites of pyridine units, and 3,5&#8208;linked PTAA&#8208;P1 particularly demonstrates a more regulated molecular configuration for interacting with perovskites, leading to highly crystalline perovskite films with uniform back contact and reduced defect density. Dopant&#8208;free PTAA&#8208;P1&#8208;based inverted PVSCs have realized remarkable efficiencies of 24.89% (certified value: 24.50%) for small&#8208;area (0.08 cm2) as well as 23.12% for large&#8208;area (1 cm2) devices. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintained over 93% of its initial efficiency after 800 hours of maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5G illumination.

         <title>Bioinspired Self&#8208;Growing Hydrogels by Harnessing the Interfacial Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The production of natural materials is achieved through a bottom&#8208;up approach, in which materials spontaneously grow and adapt to the external environment. Synthetic materials are specifically designed and fabricated as engineered materials; however, they are far away from these natural self&#8208;growing attributes. Thus, design and fabrication of synthetic material systems to replicate the self&#8208;growing characteristics of those natural prototypes (i.e., hairs and nails) remains challenging. Inspired by the self&#8208;growing behaviors of keratin proteins, here we report the fabrication of synthetic hydrogels (i.e., polyacrylamide, PAAm) from the free radical polymerization at the interface between AAm precursor solution and liquid metals (i.e., eutectic gallium&#8208;indium, EGaIn). The newly&#8208;formed hydrogel materials at the EGaIn/AAm precursor interface gradually push the whole hydrogel upwards, enabling the self&#8208;growing of these synthetic hydrogel materials. This work not only endows the fabrication of synthetic materials with unprecedented self&#8208;growing characters, but also broadens the potential applications of self&#8208;growing materials in actuation and soft robotics.

         <title>High&#8208;Q Nanophotonics Over the Full Visible Spectrum Enabled by Hexagonal Boron Nitride Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;dielectric optical metasurfaces with high quality (Q) factors have so far been hampered by the lack of simultaneously lossless and high refractive index (RI) materials over the full visible spectrum. To achieve broad spectral coverage, the use of low&#8208;index materials is, in fact, unavoidable due to the inverse correlation between the band&#8208;gap energy (and therefore the optical losses) and the RI. However, for Mie resonant photonics, smaller RIs are associated with reduced Q factors and mode volume confinement. In this work, we leverage symmetry&#8208;broken quasi bound states in the continuum (qBICs) to efficiently suppress radiation losses from the low&#8208;index (n&#8764;2) van der Waals material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), realizing metasurfaces with high&#8208;Q resonances over the complete visible spectrum. In particular, we analyze the rational use of low and high RI materials as resonator components and harness our insights to experimentally demonstrate sharp qBIC resonances with Q factors above 300, spanning wavelengths between 400&#160;nm and 1000&#160;nm from a single hBN flake. Moreover, we utilize the enhanced electric near&#8208;fields to demonstrate second harmonic generation (SHG) with enhancement factors above 102. Our results provide a theoretical and experimental framework for the implementation of low RI materials as photonic media for metaoptics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances our understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. We present a novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality. We achieve this by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favouring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve our understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots has shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, we demonstrate a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components: FePt nanoparticle&#8208;embedded PETA, pNIPAM, and pNIPAM&#8208;AAc structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP-MXene/Zn-P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP-MXene/Zn-P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP-MXene/Zn-P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold-trap environment printing (3 DCEP-MXene/Co-MnHCF), the 3DCEP-MXene/Zn-P//3DCEP-MXene/Co-MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro-zinc storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Collective Behaviors of Active Matter Learning from Natural Taxes Across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and synthetic agents perform collective taxes based on the local taxis between neighbors and global taxis toward various stimuli. Microorganisms and microrobots perform collective taxes in forms of one&#8208;way transformation, reversible generation, high&#8208;order system, and hierarchical system. Synthetic or biohybrid collectives conduct on&#8208;demand functionalities in environmental and biomedical engineering toward clinical trials owing to the efficiency, robustness, and adaptivity.








Abstract
Taxis orientation is common in microorganisms, and it provides feasible strategies to operate active colloids as small&#8208;scale robots. Collective taxes involve numerous units that collectively perform taxis motion, whereby the collective cooperation between individuals enables the group to perform efficiently, adaptively, and robustly. Hence, analyzing and designing collectives is crucial for developing and advancing microswarm toward practical or clinical applications. In this review, natural taxis behaviors are categorized and synthetic microrobotic collectives are discussed as bio&#8208;inspired realizations, aiming at closing the gap between taxis strategies of living creatures and those of functional active microswarms. As collective behaviors emerge within a group, the global taxis to external stimuli guides the group to conduct overall tasks, whereas the local taxis between individuals induces synchronization and global patterns. By encoding the local orientations and programming the global stimuli, various paradigms can be introduced for coordinating and controlling such collective microrobots, from the viewpoints of fundamental science and practical applications. Therefore, by discussing the key points and difficulties associated with collective taxes of different paradigms, this review potentially offers insights into mimicking natural collective behaviors and constructing intelligent microrobotic systems for on&#8208;demand control and preassigned&#160;tasks.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Physical Origin of Negative Differential Resistance in V3O5 and Its Application as a Solid&#8208;State Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of V3O5 and its application as a functional oxide layer in volatile memristive switching devices are reported, with a particular focus on the devlopment of oxide&#8208;based relaxation oscillators as artificial neurons in hardware&#8208;based neural networks. 








Abstract
Oxides that exhibit an insulator&#8211;metal transition can be used to fabricate energy&#8208;efficient relaxation oscillators for use in hardware&#8208;based neural networks but there are very few oxides with transition temperatures above room temperature. Here the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of V3O5 thin films and their application as the functional oxide in metal/oxide/metal relaxation oscillators are reported. The V3O5 devices show electroforming&#8208;free volatile threshold switching and negative differential resistance (NDR) with stable (&lt;3% variation) cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle operation. The physical mechanisms underpinning these characteristics are investigated using a combination of electrical measurements, in situ thermal imaging, and device modeling. This shows that conduction is confined to a narrow filamentary path due to self&#8208;confinement of the current distribution and that the NDR response is initiated at temperatures well below the insulator&#8211;metal transition temperature where it is dominated by the temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity of the insulating phase. Finally, the dynamics of individual and coupled V3O5&#8208;based relaxation oscillators is reported, showing that capacitively coupled devices exhibit rich non&#8208;linear dynamics, including frequency and phase synchronization. These results establish V3O5 as a new functional material for volatile threshold switching and advance the development of robust solid&#8208;state neurons for neuromorphic computing.

&lt;p&gt;The unique properties of V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and its application as a functional oxide layer in volatile memristive switching devices are reported, with a particular focus on the devlopment of oxide-based relaxation oscillators as artificial neurons in hardware-based neural networks. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxides that exhibit an insulator&#8211;metal transition can be used to fabricate energy-efficient relaxation oscillators for use in hardware-based neural networks but there are very few oxides with transition temperatures above room temperature. Here the structural, electrical, and thermal properties of V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; thin films and their application as the functional oxide in metal/oxide/metal relaxation oscillators are reported. The V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; devices show electroforming-free volatile threshold switching and negative differential resistance (NDR) with stable (&amp;lt;3% variation) cycle-to-cycle operation. The physical mechanisms underpinning these characteristics are investigated using a combination of electrical measurements, in situ thermal imaging, and device modeling. This shows that conduction is confined to a narrow filamentary path due to self-confinement of the current distribution and that the NDR response is initiated at temperatures well below the insulator&#8211;metal transition temperature where it is dominated by the temperature-dependent conductivity of the insulating phase. Finally, the dynamics of individual and coupled V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-based relaxation oscillators is reported, showing that capacitively coupled devices exhibit rich non-linear dynamics, including frequency and phase synchronization. These results establish V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; as a new functional material for volatile threshold switching and advance the development of robust solid-state neurons for neuromorphic computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate Conversion</title>

Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, we report a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst &#8211; consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. We integrated the catalyst in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly and found that this enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190 hours, whilst achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50 percent toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15 percent at a current density of 250&#160;mA cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Enhanced Moisture Stability of Lithium Rich Anti&#8208;perovskites for Sustainable All Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Lithium rich anti&#8208;perovskites (LiRAPs) solid electrolytes have attracted extensive interests due to their advantages of structural tunability, mechanical flexibility and low cost. However, LiRAPs are instinctively hygroscopic and suffer from decomposition in air, which not only diversifies their electrochemical performances in present reports, but also hinders their application in all solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, we systematically investigated the origin of the hygroscopicity and also the effect of the hygroscopicity on the electrochemical performances of Li3&#8208;x(OHx)Cl. Li3&#8208;x(OHx)Cl is demonstrated to be unstable in air and prone to decompose into LiOH and LiCl. Nevertheless, with fluorine doping on chlorine sites, the hygroscopicity of LiRAPs was suppressed by weakening the intermolecular hydrogen bond between LiRAPs and H2O, forming a moisture&#8208;resistive Li3&#8208;x(OHx)Cl0.9F0.1. Taking advantage of its low melting point (274 &#176;C), two prototypes of ASSLBs were assembled in the ambient air by means of co&#8208;coating sintering and melt&#8208;infiltration. With LiRAPs as the solder, low&#8208;temperature sintering of the ASSLBs with low interfacial resistance was demonstrated as feasible. The understanding on the hygroscopic behavior of LiRAPs and the integration of the moisture&#8208;resistive LiRAPs with ASSLBs provide an effective way towards the fabrication of the ASSLBs.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8722;x&#8722;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, we reveal that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, we found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Li&#8208;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0 &#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8208;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory. And there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8208;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, the antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory (DFT) analysis systematically investigated Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8208;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly revealed the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating that dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8208;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40 &#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8211;2) and lean electrolyte condition (E/S = 4&#160;mL g&#8211;1) was fabricated, which delivered a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8211;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 at 0 &#176;C, offering a promising route toward practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Hexagonal Boron Nitride for Next&#8208;Generation Photonics and Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) has attracted great interest motivated by fascinating properties in the fields of quantum optics, electronics, and optoelectronics. The most recent discoveries of structural, optical, and electrical properties of h&#8208;BN and advancements in emerging photonic and electronic applications are reviewed.








Abstract
Hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN), an insulating 2D layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h&#8208;BN research, it is&#160;explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface that is free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and its high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h&#8208;BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h&#8208;BN shows a very efficient deep&#8208;ultraviolet band&#8208;edge emission despite its indirect&#8208;bandgap nature, as well as stable room&#8208;temperature single&#8208;photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next&#8208;generation photonics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), an insulating 2D layered material, has recently attracted tremendous interest motivated by the extraordinary properties it shows across the fields of optoelectronics, quantum optics, and electronics, being exotic material platforms for various applications. At an early stage of h-BN research, it is&#160;explored as an ideal substrate and insulating layers for other 2D materials due to its atomically flat surface that is free of dangling bonds and charged impurities, and its high thermal conductivity. Recent discoveries of structural and optical properties of h-BN have expanded potential applications into emerging electronics and photonics fields. h-BN shows a very efficient deep-ultraviolet band-edge emission despite its indirect-bandgap nature, as well as stable room-temperature single-photon emission over a wide wavelength range, showing a great potential for next-generation photonics. In addition, h-BN is extensively being adopted as active media for low-energy electronics, including nonvolatile resistive switching memory, radio-frequency devices, and low-dielectric-constant materials for next-generation electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Thermomechanically Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on a shape&#8208;memory polymer and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque.








Abstract
Future active metamaterials for reconfigurable structural applications require fast, untethered, reversible, and reprogrammable (multimodal) transformability with shape locking. Magnetic control has a superior advantage for fast and remotely controlled deployment; however, a significant drawback is needed to maintain the magnetic force to hold the transformation, limiting its use in structural applications. The shape&#8208;locking property of shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) can resolve this issue. However, the intrinsic irreversibility of SMPs may limit their reconfigurability as active metamaterials. Moreover, to date, reprogrammable methods have required high power with laser and arc welding proving to be energy&#8208;inefficient control methods. In this work, a magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool is constructed and demonstrated, which enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations, and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on the SMP and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque. The mutual assistance of two physics concepts&#8212;magnetic control combined with the thermomechanical behavior of SMPs&#160;is demonstrated, without requiring new materials synthesis and high&#8208;power energy for reprogramming. This approach can open a new path of active metamaterials, flexible yet stiff soft robots, multimodal morphing structures, and mechanical computing devices where it can be designed in reversible and reprogrammable ways.

         <title>Controlled Synthesis of Submillimeter Non&#8208;layered WO2 Nanoplates via a WSe2&#8208;Assisted Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional metal oxides (2DMOs) have stimulated tremendous attention due to their distinct electronic structures and abundant surface chemistry. However, it remains a standing challenge for the synthesis of 2DMOs because of their intrinsic 3D lattice structure and ultrahigh synthesis temperature. Here, a reliable WSe2&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy to grow high&#8208;quality and non&#8208;layered WO2 nanoplates with tunable thickness and lateral dimension is reported. Optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies demonstrate that WO2 nanoplates exhibit a well&#8208;faceted rhombic geometry with a lateral dimension up to the submillimeter level (&#8764;135&#160;&#956;m), which is the largest size of 2D metal oxide single crystals obtained by CVD to date. Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) studies reveal that the nanoplates are high&#8208;quality single crystals with a monoclinic WO2 crystal structure. Electrical measurements show the nanoplates exhibit metallic behavior with strong anisotropic resistance, outstanding conductivity of 1.1&#215;106 S m&#8722;1, and breakdown current density of 7.1 &#215; 107 A cm&#8722;2. More interestingly, low&#8208;temperature magnetotransport studies demonstrate that the nanoplates show the quantum&#8208;interference&#8208;induced weak localization effect. The developed WSe2&#8208;assisted strategy for the growth of WO2 nanoplates could enrich the library of 2D metal oxide materials and provide a material platform for other property explorations based on 2D WO2.

         <title>Computational Biomaterials: Computational Simulations for Biomedicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically introduces the achievements on computational biomaterials in biomedical applications, summarizes the computational simulation in revealing internal physicochemical mechanism behind the biomaterial, and offers an outlook on the computatinal biomaterials in nanoenabled amalgamation of chemistry, material science, biology, computational and medicine based on the reports of computational biomaterials&#8208;involved disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapies and other biomimetic biomaterials.








Abstract
With the flourishing development of material simulation methods (quantum chemistry methods, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, phase field, etc.), extensive adoption of computing technologies (high&#8208;throughput, artificial intelligence, machine learning, etc.), and the invention of high&#8208;performance computing equipment, computational simulation tools have sparked the fundamental mechanism&#8208;level explorations to predict the diverse physicochemical properties and biological effects of biomaterials and investigate their enormous application potential for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. Herein, the term &#8220;computational biomaterials&#8221; is proposed and the computational methods currently used to explore the inherent properties of biomaterials, such as optical, magnetic, electronic, and acoustic properties, and the elucidation of corresponding biological behaviors/effects in the biomedical field are summarized/discussed. The theoretical calculation of the physiochemical properties/biological performance of biomaterials applied in disease diagnosis, drug delivery, disease therapeutics, and specific paradigms such as biomimetic biomaterials is discussed. Additionally, the biosafety evaluation applications of theoretical simulations of biomaterials are presented. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of such computational simulations for biomaterials development are clarified. It is anticipated that these simulations would offer various methodologies for facilitating the development and future clinical translations/utilization of versatile biomaterials.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.

Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Approaching Bulk Mobility in PbSe Colloidal Quantum Dots 3D Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot superlattices hold promise to combine tunable optical properties with electrical transport comparable to bulk semiconductors. In this work, it is demonstrated that the self&#8208;assembly of highly ordered 3D superlattices made from PbSe colloidal quantum dots achieves record electron mobilities up to 278 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, the highest for these systems and for any self&#8208;assembled solid of quantum&#8208;confined objects.








Abstract
3D superlattices made of colloidal quantum dots are a promising candidate for the next generation of optoelectronic devices as they are expected to exhibit a unique combination of tunable optical properties and coherent electrical transport through minibands. While most of the previous work was&#160;performed on 2D arrays, the control over the formation of these systems is lacking, where limited long&#8208;range order and energetical disorder have so far hindered the potential of these metamaterials, giving rise to disappointing transport properties. Here, it is reported that nanoscale&#8208;level controlled ordering of colloidal quantum dots in 3D and over large areas allows the achievement of outstanding transport properties. The measured electron mobilities are the highest ever reported for a self&#8208;assembled solid of fully quantum&#8208;confined objects. This ultimately demonstrates that optoelectronic metamaterials with highly tunable optical properties (in this case in the short&#8208;wavelength infrared spectral range) and charge mobilities approaching that of bulk semiconductor can be obtained. This finding paves the way toward a new generation of optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Vanadium Catalyst Boosting Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides in Na&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;life room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries are realized by the development of a single atom vanadium anchored on 3D nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (3D&#8208;PNCV) as an ideal host in RT Na&#8211;S chemistry. Such host possesses the advantages of the abundant micro/mesoporous, highly reactive V single atom, which can restrain the polysulfides dissolution and in time catalyze the conversion of polysulfide into solid discharged products.








Abstract
The practical application of the room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, the severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfide conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, single&#8208;atom vanadium anchored on a 3D&#160;nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D&#8208;PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D&#8208;PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8211;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Therefore, as&#8208;fabricated RT Na&#8211;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 800 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (224&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>Integrated Solar Panel with Triboelectric Nanogenerator Array for Synergistic Harvesting of Raindrop and Solar Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is regarded as an effective strategy for raindrop energy harvesting, and is a complementary solution with solar cells to achieve all&#8208;weather energy harvesting and sustainable energy supply. However, due to the irregularity of natural rainfalls in the volume, frequency, density, and location, etc., designing high&#8208;efficiency raindrop TENG (R&#8208;TENG) arrays faces great challenges. Here, a highly transparent, large&#8208;area and high&#8208;efficiency R&#8208;TENG array with rational material choice, electrode structure, and array distribution is developed for efficiently harvesting irregular raindrop energy. The problem of electrical signal cancellation among adjacent raindrops can be fully avoided, as viewed from the high&#8208;resolution space&#8208;time analyses of high&#8208;speed camera and electrical signal characteristic. With the rationally&#8208;designed electrode instead of multiple complex electrodes, all charges can be exported by the R&#8208;TENG array in a simulated irregular raindrop scenario. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the R&#8208;TENG possesses higher average power density (40.80&#160;mW m&#8722;2) than that of solar cell (37.03&#160;mW m&#8722;2) in raining condition. Additionally, a self&#8208;powered wireless light intensity monitoring system has been demonstrated for real&#8208;time and all&#8208;day weather monitoring. This work provides useful guidance for designing high&#8208;efficiency TENG array integrated with solar panel for harvesting irregular raindrop energy and solar energy.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, owing to their extremely low thickness, are ideal materials for nanopores with optimal detection sensitivity and resolution. Among 2D materials, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has gained significant traction as a more suitable nanopore material compared to graphene, which is much more hydrophobic. However, performing experiments using 2D nanopores remains challenging due to the lack of scalable fabrication methods of high&#8208;quality freestanding membranes. Here we report a site&#8208;directed, scaled&#8208;up synthesis of MoS2 freestanding membranes on predrilled nanoapertures on 4&#8208;inch wafer substrates with 75% yields. A unique chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method that introduces sulfur and molybdenum dioxide vapors across both sides of the sub&#8208;100&#160;nm nanoapertures results in the exclusive formation of freestanding membranes that seal the apertures. Nucleation and growth near the nanoaperture edges is followed by nanoaperture decoration with MoS2 which proceeds until a critical flake radius of curvature is achieved, after which fully spanning freestanding membranes form. Intentionally blocking flow of reagents through the apertures inhibits MoS2 nucleation around the nanoapertures, thereby promoting the formation of large&#8208;crystal monolayer MoS2 membranes. The in situ grown membranes along with facile membrane wetting and nanopore formation using dielectric breakdown enabled the recording of dsDNA translocation events at 1&#160;MHz bandwidth, unprecedented for 2D nanopores. The methods presented here are important steps towards the development of many applications requiring single&#8208;layer membranes built at&#8208;scale in high&#8208;throughput 2D nanofluidics and nanopores studies.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered perovskites (LPs) have shown great potential to deliver high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices with long&#8208;term stability. Despite many progresses have been made in film quality and device performance, the LP films are mainly processed in strict conditions and through non&#8208;scalable techniques. Here we introduce the hot&#8208;air&#8208;assisted ambient fabrication technique to prepare LP films for efficient and stable solar cells. The high&#8208;quality LP films with good crystallinity, preferable orientation and desirable morphology are obtained by balancing the crystal nucleation and growth processes. Employing the synchrotron&#8208;based in situ grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction technique, we find hot air induces the solidification of solutes and forms an intermediate at the air&#8208;liquid interface, which transforms into the 3D&#8208;like perovskite, followed by the growth of 2D species towards the substrate. The optimal LP film delivers a device power conversion efficiency of 16.36%, the best value for the LP&#8208;based solar cells prepared by the non&#8208;spin&#8208;coating techniques. The solar cell performance is insensitive to the film processing humidity and the device size is up&#8208;scalable, which promises the real&#8208;world deployment of the LP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Regulating Surface Oxygen Activity by Perovskite Coating Stabilized Ultrahigh&#8208;Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrahigh&#8208;Ni layered oxides have been proposed as promising cathodes to fulfill the range demand of electric vehicles, yet they are still haunted by compromised cyclability and thermal robustness. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art surficial coating is designed to solve the instability via blocking the physical contact between the electrolyte and the highly active Ni4+ ions on the cathode surface, but it falls short in handling the chemo&#8208;physical mobility of the oxidized lattice oxygen ions in the cathode. Herein, a direct regulation strategy is proposed to accommodate the highly active anionic redox within the solid phase. By leveraging the stable oxygen vacancies/interstitials in a lithium and oxygen dual&#8208;ion conductor (layered perovskite La4NiLiO8) coating layer, the reactivity of the surficial lattice oxygen ion is dramatically restrained. As a result, the oxygen release from the lattice is suppressed, as well as the undesired irreversible phase transition and intergranular mechanical cracking. Meanwhile, the introduced dual&#8208;ion conductor can also facilitate lithium ions diffusion kinetics and electronic conductivity on the particle surface. This work demonstrates that accommodating the anionic redox chemistry by dual ion conductors is an effective strategy for capacity versus stability juggling of the high&#8208;energy cathodes.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Death happening in massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, we develop a covalent crosslinked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60 seconds. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14 days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Tunable Photochromism of Spirooxazine in the Solid State: A New Design Strategy Based on the Hypochromic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As an important organic photo&#8208;functional material, spirooxazine usually does not exhibit photochromism in the solid state since the intermolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking impedes photoisomerization. Developing photochromic spirooxazine in the solid state is crucial for practical applications but is still full of challenges. Here, we design and synthesize a series of spirooxazine derivatives (SO1&#8208;SO4) with bulky aromatic substituents at the 4&#8208; and 7&#8208;positions of the skeleton, providing a large volume for them to undergo solid&#8208;state photochromism under mild conditions. All compounds SO1&#8208;SO4 exhibit tunable solid photochromism without ground colors, excellent fatigue resistance, and high thermal stability. Notably, it takes only 15 s for SO4 to reach the saturation of absorption intensity, representing the fastest solid&#8208;state photoresponse of spirooxazines to the best of our knowledge. X&#8208;ray crystal structures of the intermediate compound SO0 and the products SO1&#8208;SO2 as well as the computational studies suggest that the bulky aromatic groups can lead to a hypochromic effect, allowing for the photochromism of SO in the solid state. The ideal photochromic properties of these spirooxazines open a new avenue for their applications in UV printing, Quick Response (QR) code, and related fields.

         <title>Compute in&#8208;Memory with Non&#8208;Volatile Elements for Neural Networks: A Review from a Co&#8208;Design Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep learning has become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture and performance. We consider both digital and analog memory, assess the status for both training and inference, and provide metrics for the collective set of properties existing and new non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <title>Laser&#8208;induced Hole Coherence and Spatial Self&#8208;phase Modulation in the Anisotropic 3D Weyl Semimetal TaAs</title>

Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced electron coherence is a fascinating topic in manipulating quantum materials. Recently, it has been shown that laser&#8208;induced electron coherence in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials can produce a third&#8208;order nonlinear optical response spatial self&#8208;phase modulation (SSPM), which has been used to develop a novel all&#8208;optical switching scheme. However, such investigations have mainly focused on electron coherence, whereas laser&#8208;induced hole coherence is rarely explored. Here, we report on the observation of the optical Kerr effect in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Weyl semimetal TaAs flakes. The nonlinear susceptibility (&#967;(3)) is obtained, which exhibits a surprisingly high value (with &#967;one&#8722;layer(3)$\chi _{{\bf{one}} - {\bf{layer}}}^{( 3 )}$ = 9.9&#215;10&#8722;9 e.s.u. or 1.4&#215;10&#8722;16 m2/V2 at 532&#160;nm). This could not be explained by the conventional electron mobility, but could be well understood by the unique high anisotropic hole mobility of TaAs. The Wind Chime Model and &#967;(3)&#8208;carrier mobility correlation adequately explain the results, suggesting the crucial role of laser&#8208;induced non&#8208;local ac hole coherence. Our observations extend the understanding of SSPM from 2D to 3D quantum materials with anisotropic carrier mobility, and from electron coherence to hole coherence.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional fiber&#8208;enabled intelligent health agent with characteristics of autonomy, activeness, intelligence, and perceptibility, enabling health services, is proposed. Four major aspects driven by intelligent agents are summarized from the perspectives of materials science, medicine, and computer science. The agent is realized through multifunctional fibers as sensing units and artificial intelligence technology as a cognitive engine.








Abstract
The application of wearable devices is promoting the development toward digitization and intelligence in the field of health. However, the current smart devices centered on human health have disadvantages such as weak perception, high interference degree, and unfriendly interaction. Here, an intelligent health agent based on multifunctional fibers, with the characteristics of autonomy, activeness, intelligence, and perceptibility enabling health services, is proposed. According to the requirements for healthcare in the medical field and daily life, four major aspects driven by intelligent agents, including health monitoring, therapy, protection, and minimally invasive surgery, are summarized from the perspectives of materials science, medicine, and computer science. The function of intelligent health agents is realized through multifunctional fibers as sensing units and artificial intelligence technology as a cognitive engine. The structure, characteristics, and performance of fibers and analysis systems and algorithms are reviewed, while discussing future challenges and opportunities in healthcare and medicine. Finally, based on the above four aspects, future scenarios related to health protection of a person's life are presented. Intelligent health agents will have the potential to accelerate the realization of precision medicine and active health.

Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries
One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. In article number 2200912, Lixia Yuan, Henghui Xu, Yunhui Huang, and co&#8208;workers review the key links in the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials from lab to industrialization and give future perspectives for designing practical high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for LIBs.

         <title>Current and Future Trends for Polymer Micro/Nanoprocessing in Industrial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development trends, and advantages and deficiencies of three processing methods: micro/nanomolding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining (microcutting, micro/nanowelding, and LIGA) are systematically summarized, adding to the existing body of knowledge for employing appropriate polymer processing techniques in customized industrial applications.








Abstract
Polymers are widely used in optical devices, electronic devices, energy&#8208;harvesting/storage devices, and sensors, owing to their low weight, excellent flexibility, and simple fabrication process. With advancements in micro/nanoprocessing techniques and more demanding application requirements, it is becoming necessary to realize high&#8208;resolution fabrication of polymers to prepare miniaturized devices. This is particularly because conventional processing technologies suffer from high thermal stress and strong adhesion/friction, which can irreversibly damage the micro/nanostructures of miniaturized devices. In addition, although the use of advanced fabrication methods to prepare high&#8208;resolution micro/nanostructures is explored, these methods are limited to laboratory research or small&#8208;batch production. This review focuses on the micro/nanoprocessing of polymeric materials and devices with high spatial precision and replication accuracy for industrial applications. Specifically, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and future trends for micro/nanomolding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining are discussed. Moreover, an overview of the fabrication and applications of various polymer&#8208;based elements and devices such as microlenses, biosensors, and transistors is provided. These techniques are expected to be widely applied for multiscale and multimaterial processing as well as for multifunction integration in next&#8208;generation integrated devices, such as photoelectric, smart, and biodegradable devices.

         <title>Influence of Oxidation on Structure, Performance, and Application of Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research concerning metallic glass oxidation is reviewed by summarizing metallic glass oxidation behaviors, how oxidation influences metallic glass structure and performance, and the possibilities and the feasibility of using controlled oxidation to reinforce metallic glasses or develop metallic glass systems.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structure and outstanding properties, metallic glasses are a novel class of structural and functional materials with vast application prospects. However, the metastable amorphous structures and chemical activity of metallic glass constituent elements lead to frequent oxidation during preparation, processing, and application. Comprehensively understanding the oxidation behaviors and underlying mechanisms of metallic glasses is essential for gaining knowledge of metallic glass structures and properties and for promoting engineering applications. Although many studies have examined these issues, more investigations are still required to explore potential industrial applications of metallic glasses. Here, recent research on metallic glass oxidation is consolidated by summarizing the oxidation influence on metallic glass structure, performance, and application and the possibilities and feasibility of oxidizing metallic glasses to reinforce materials or develop material systems are discussed.

     alt="Influence of Oxidation on Structure, Performance, and Application of Metallic Glasses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research concerning metallic glass oxidation is reviewed by summarizing metallic glass oxidation behaviors, how oxidation influences metallic glass structure and performance, and the possibilities and the feasibility of using controlled oxidation to reinforce metallic glasses or develop metallic glass systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their unique structure and outstanding properties, metallic glasses are a novel class of structural and functional materials with vast application prospects. However, the metastable amorphous structures and chemical activity of metallic glass constituent elements lead to frequent oxidation during preparation, processing, and application. Comprehensively understanding the oxidation behaviors and underlying mechanisms of metallic glasses is essential for gaining knowledge of metallic glass structures and properties and for promoting engineering applications. Although many studies have examined these issues, more investigations are still required to explore potential industrial applications of metallic glasses. Here, recent research on metallic glass oxidation is consolidated by summarizing the oxidation influence on metallic glass structure, performance, and application and the possibilities and feasibility of oxidizing metallic glasses to reinforce materials or develop material systems are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fabrication and Functionality Integration Technologies for Small&#8208;Scale Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale soft robots have immense potential at present and in the foreseeable future, with utility in exploration, medical, and biomimetic applications, among others. Being enabling technologies, the fabrication and integration techniques of small&#8208;scale soft robots are systematically reviewed. By discussing the challenges and opportunities, potential directions for the further development of small&#8208;scale soft robots are highlighted.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale soft robots are attracting increasing interest for visible and potential applications owing to their safety and tolerance resulting from their intrinsic soft bodies or compliant structures. However, it is not sufficient that the soft bodies merely provide support or system protection. More importantly, to meet the increasing demands of controllable operation and real&#8208;time feedback in unstructured/complicated scenarios, these robots are required to perform simplex and multimodal functionalities for sensing, communicating, and interacting with external environments during large or dynamic deformation with the risk of mismatch or delamination. Challenges are encountered during fabrication and integration, including the selection and fabrication of composite/materials and structures, integration of active/passive functional modules with robust interfaces, particularly with highly deformable soft/stretchable bodies. Here, methods and strategies of fabricating structural soft bodies and integrating them with functional modules for developing small&#8208;scale soft robots are investigated. Utilizing templating, 3D printing, transfer printing, and swelling, small&#8208;scale soft robots can be endowed with several perceptual capabilities corresponding to diverse stimulus, such as light, heat, magnetism, and force. The integration of sensing and functionalities effectively enhances the agility, adaptability, and universality of soft robots when applied in various fields, including smart manufacturing, medical surgery, biomimetics, and other interdisciplinary sciences.

         <title>Structural Design and Fabrication of Multifunctional Nanocarbon Materials for Extreme Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene have provided a variety of unique extreme environmental properties. The recent advances on nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are summarized from the feature of individual nanocarbon components, principles of structural design, fabrication technologies, while examples of their extreme environmental applications with the underlying working mechanism are given.








Abstract
Extreme environments represent numerous harsh environmental conditions, such as temperature, pressure, corrosion, and radiation. The tolerance of applications in extreme environments exemplifies significant challenges to both materials and their structures. Given the superior mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, thermal stability, and chemical stability of nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene, they are widely investigated as base materials for extreme environmental applications and have shown numerous breakthroughs in the fields of wide&#8208;temperature structural&#8208;material construction, low&#8208;temperature energy storage, underwater sensing, and electronics operated at high temperatures. Here, the critical aspects of structural design and fabrication of nanocarbon materials for extreme environments are reviewed, including a description of the underlying mechanism supporting the performance of nanocarbon materials against extreme environments, the principles of structural design of nanocarbon materials for the optimization of extreme environmental performances, and the fabrication processes developed for the realization of specific extreme environmental applications. Finally, perspectives on how CNTs and graphene can further contribute to the development of extreme environmental applications are presented.

         <title>Nanopatterning Technologies of 2D Materials for Integrated Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopatterning bridges the microstructure of 2D materials and integrated chip devices, essentially enabling and prompting their successful application in industry. A critical summary on the recent development of key nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials, with the aim of realizing large&#8208;scale device integration, is provided. This contribution offers a pioneering reference and guidelines to promote 2D materials from laboratory research to practical use.








Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, traditional 3D semiconductors are unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on Moore's law. 2D materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt 2D materials and devices from the laboratory research stage to the industrial integrated circuit&#8208;level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high&#8208;quality, wafer&#8208;scale, and patterned 2D products. Herein, the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly toward realizing large&#8208;scale practical application of 2D materials is reviewed. Based on the technological progress, the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory, and optoelectronic devices are further summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices are prospected.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks (c&#8208;MOFs), as an emerging class of electrode materials, have attracted great attention recently. The efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of c&#8208;MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are reviewed. The recent achievements of developing supercapacitors with c&#8208;MOF electrodes are discussed, from the experimental performance to a fundamental understanding of the energy storage mechanism, highlighting their bottlenecks and perspectives.








Abstract
As a class of porous materials with crystal lattices, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring outstanding specific surface area, tunable functionality, and versatile structures, have attracted huge attention in the past two decades. Since the first conductive MOF&#160;is&#160;successfully synthesized in 2009, considerable progress has been achieved for the development of conductive MOFs, allowing their use in diverse applications for electrochemical energy storage. Among those applications, supercapacitors have received great interest because of their high power density, fast charging ability, and excellent cycling stability. Here, the efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of conductive MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance are summarized. Using conductive MOFs as a unique platform medium, the electronic and molecular aspects of the energy storage mechanism in supercapacitors with MOF electrodes are discussed, highlighting the advantages and limitations to inspire new ideas for the development of conductive MOFs for supercapacitors.

         <title>Light Emission of Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in Inorganic Metal Halides for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Their fundamental emission mechanism endows self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton (STE)&#8208;emission metal halides with unique optoelectronic properties and broad applications. Recent progress on STE emission materials for optoelectronic applications, and the mechanisms&#8211;compositions&#8211;application relationships are systematically discussed. Current existing challenges and possible development opportunities are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their broadband emission, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and self&#8208;absorption&#8208;free properties, which enable a large range of optoelectronic applications such as lighting, displays, radiation detection, and special sensors. Unlike free excitons, the formation of STEs requires strong coupling between excited state excitons and the soft lattice in low electronic dimensional materials. The chemical and structural diversity of metal halides provides an ideal platform for developing efficient STE emission materials. Herein, an overview of recent progress on STE emission materials for optoelectronic applications is presented. The relationships between the fundamental emission mechanisms, chemical compositions, and device performances are systematically reviewed. On this basis, currently existing challenges and possible development opportunities in this field are presented.

&lt;p&gt;Self-trapped excitons (STEs) have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their broadband emission, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and self-absorption-free properties, which enable a large range of optoelectronic applications such as lighting, displays, radiation detection, and special sensors. Unlike free excitons, the formation of STEs requires strong coupling between excited state excitons and the soft lattice in low electronic dimensional materials. The chemical and structural diversity of metal halides provides an ideal platform for developing efficient STE emission materials. Herein, an overview of recent progress on STE emission materials for optoelectronic applications is presented. The relationships between the fundamental emission mechanisms, chemical compositions, and device performances are systematically reviewed. On this basis, currently existing challenges and possible development opportunities in this field are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Li&#8208;ion batteries are a typical electrochemical system controlled by ion&#8208;insertion dynamics. The recent progress on the investigation of battery dynamics at various scales is reviewed, via newly developed visualization techniques that provide powerful tools to make the &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; into a &#8220;see&#8208;through&#8221; battery.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries, the most&#8208;popular secondary battery, are typically electrochemical systems controlled by ion&#8208;insertion dynamics. The battery dynamics involve mass transport, charge transfer, ion&#8211;electron coupled reactions, electrolyte penetration, ion solvation, and interfacial evolution. However, it is difficult for the traditional electrochemical methods to capture the accurate and individual details of the dynamic processes in &#8220;black box&#8221; batteries; instead, only the net result of multi&#8208;factors on the whole scale. Recently, different advanced visualization techniques have been developed, which provide powerful tools to track and monitor the internal real&#8208;time dynamic processes, giving intuitive details and fine information at various scales from crystal lattice, single particle, electrode to cell level. Here, the recent progress on the investigation of electrochemical dynamics in battery materials are reviewed, via developed techniques across wide timescales and space&#8208;scales, including the dynamic process inside the active particle, kinetics issues at the electrode/electrolyte interface, dynamic inhomogeneity in the electrode, and dynamic transportation at the cell level. Finally, the fundamental principles to improve the battery dynamics are summarized and new technologies for future more stringent conditions are highlighted. In prospect, this review opens sight on the battery interior for a clearer, deeper, and more thorough understanding of the dynamics.

         <title>Building Practical High&#8208;Voltage Cathode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. The key links in the development of the high&#8208;voltage cathode materials from lab to industrialization are considered and an overview of the challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high&#8208;voltage cathode is presented.








Abstract
It has long been a global imperative to develop high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) to meet the ever&#8208;growing electric vehicle market. One of the most effective strategies for boosting the energy density of LIBs is to increase the output voltage, which largely depends upon the cathode materials. As the most&#8208;promising cathodes for high&#8208;voltage LIBs (&gt;4&#160;V vs Li/Li+), four major categories of cathodes including lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides, nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides, spinel oxides, and high&#8208;voltage polyanionic compounds still encounter severe challenges to realize the improvement of output voltage while maintaining high capacity, fast rate capability, and long service life. This review focuses on the key links in the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials from the lab to industrialization. First, the failure mechanisms of the four kinds of materials are clarified, and the optimization strategies, particularly solutions that are easy for large&#8208;scale production, are considered. Then, to bridge the gap between lab and industry, the cost management, safety assessment, practical battery&#8208;performance evaluation, and sustainability of the battery technologies, are discussed. Finally, tough challenges and promising strategies for the commercialization of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials are summarized to promote the large&#8208;scale application of LIBs with high energy densities.

         <title>Intelligent Micro&#8208;/Nanorobots for Cancer Theragnostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview on the recent advances of micro&#8208;/nanorobots&#8208;based cancer theragnostic is presented, ranging from actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery, as well as highlighting the most promising research opportunities for the next decade that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer is one of the most intractable diseases owing to its high mortality rate and lack of effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Advancements in micro&#8208;/nanorobot (MNR)&#8208;assisted sensing, imaging, and therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop MNR&#8208;based cancer theragnostic platforms. Unlike ordinary nanoparticles, which exhibit Brownian motion in biofluids, MNRs overcome viscous resistance in an ultralow Reynolds number (Re &lt;&lt; 1) environment by effective self&#8208;propulsion. This unique locomotion property has motivated the advanced design and functionalization of MNRs as a basis for next&#8208;generation cancer&#8208;therapy platforms, which offer the potential for precise distribution and improved permeation of therapeutic agents. Enhanced barrier penetration, imaging&#8208;guided operation, and biosensing are additionally studied to enable the promising cancer&#8208;related applications of MNRs. Herein, the recent advances in MNR&#8208;based cancer therapy are comprehensively addresses, including actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery; promising research opportunities that can have a profound impact on cancer therapy over the next decade is highlighted.

         <title>Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Based Drug Delivery Systems for Enhanced Antitumor Therapies through Modulating the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular&#8208;vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems show huge potential for improved antitumor immunotherapy. Five key steps during the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle of extracellular vesicles are reviewed; namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy harnessing activity of the immune system against tumors has made great progress, the treatment efficacy remains limited in most cancers. Current anticancer immunotherapy is primarily based on T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated cellular immunity, which highly relies on efficiency of triggering the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells. Unfortunately, these immunotherapies are restricted by inefficient drug delivery and acting on only a single step of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. Due to high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, intrinsic cell targeting, and easy chemical and genetic manipulation, extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based drug delivery systems are widely used to amplify anticancer immune responses by serving as an integrated platform for multiple drugs or therapeutic strategies to synergistically activate several steps of cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. This review summarizes various mechanisms related to affecting cancer&#8208;immunity cycle disorders. Meanwhile, preparation and application of EV&#8208;based drug delivery systems in modulating cancer&#8208;immunity cycle are introduced, especially in the improvement of T cell recruitment and infiltration into tumors. Finally, opportunities and challenges of EV&#8208;based drug delivery systems in translational clinical applications are briefly discussed.

         <title>Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal photonic composites bioinspired by organic organisms combine ordered photonic structures and functional polymeric matrices, which show both structural color of photonic crystals and functionality and responsiveness of the polymeric matrix. Colloidal photonic composites exhibit a variety of promising applications, from colorful coatings to visual sensors, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence.








Abstract
Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli&#8208;responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix are artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, their state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications are also discussed, including colorful coatings, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed.

     alt="Bioinspired Colloidal Photonic Composites: Fabrications and Emerging Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal photonic composites bioinspired by organic organisms combine ordered photonic structures and functional polymeric matrices, which show both structural color of photonic crystals and functionality and responsiveness of the polymeric matrix. Colloidal photonic composites exhibit a variety of promising applications, from colorful coatings to visual sensors, anti-counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organisms in nature have evolved unique structural colors and stimuli-responsive functions for camouflage, warning, and communication over millions of years, which are essential to their survival in harsh conditions. Inspired by these characteristics, colloidal photonic composites (CPCs) composed of colloidal photonic crystals embedded in the polymeric matrix are artificially prepared and show great promise in applications. This review focuses on the summary of building blocks, i.e., colloidal particles and polymeric matrices, and constructive strategies from the perspective of designing CPCs with robust performance and specific functionality. Furthermore, their state-of-the-art applications are also discussed, including colorful coatings, anti-counterfeiting, and regulation of photoluminescence, especially in the field of visualized sensing. Finally, current challenges and potential for future developments in this field are discussed. The purpose of this review is not only to clarify the design principle for artificial CPCs but also to serve as a roadmap for the exploration of next-generation photonic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Corrosion Chemistry of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrosion chemistry of electrocatalysts is reviewed, which may inspire more profound research in functional nanomaterials and energy technologies.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts are the core components of many sustainable energy conversion technologies that are considered the most potential solution to the worldwide energy and environmental crises. The reliability of structure and composition pledges that electrocatalysts can achieve predictable and stable performance. However, during the electrochemical reaction, electrocatalysts are influenced directly by the applied potential, the electrolyte, and the adsorption/desorption of reactive species, triggering structural and compositional corrosion, which directly affects the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts (performance degradation or enhancement) and invalidates the established structure&#8211;activity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the corrosion behavior and mechanism of electrocatalysts to formulate targeted corrosion&#8208;resistant strategies or use corrosion reconstruction synthesis techniques to guide the preparation of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, the most recent developments in electrocatalyst corrosion chemistry are outlined, including corrosion mechanisms, mitigation strategies, and corrosion syntheses/reconstructions based on typical materials and important electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, potential opportunities and challenges are also proposed to foresee the possible development in this field. It is believed that this contribution will raise more awareness regarding nanomaterial corrosion chemistry in energy technologies and beyond.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Crystallization Processes and Methods in Nanocrystals, Single Crystals, and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation process is more thermodynamically difficult by involving a higher surface molecular unit ratio than the growth process of solution&#8208;processed halide perovskite (HP) crystals. Nucleation occurs under a higher supersaturation (C&#160;&gt; Cmin) while growth can occur when C is over Cs. Typical preparation methods for nucleation&#8208;dominated HP nanocrystals, growth&#8208;dominated HP single crystals, and nucleation&#8208;and&#8208;growth&#8208;balanced HP thin films are reviewed.








Abstract
Halide perovskite semiconductors with extraordinary optoelectronic properties have been fascinatedly studied. Halide perovskite nanocrystals, single crystals, and thin films have been prepared for various fields, such as light emission, light detection, and light harvesting. High&#8208;performance devices rely on high crystal quality determined by the nucleation and crystal growth process. Here, the fundamental understanding of the crystallization process driven by supersaturation of the solution is discussed and the methods for halide perovskite crystals are summarized. Supersaturation determines the proportion and the average Gibbs free energy changes for surface and volume molecular units involved in the spontaneous aggregation, which could be stable in the solution and induce homogeneous nucleation only when the solution exceeds a required minimum critical concentration (Cmin). Crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation are thermodynamically easier than homogeneous nucleation due to the existent surfaces. Nanocrystals are mainly prepared via the nucleation&#8208;dominated process by rapidly increasing the concentration over Cmin, single crystals are mainly prepared via the growth&#8208;dominated process by keeping the concentration between solubility and Cmin, while thin films are mainly prepared by compromising the nucleation and growth processes to ensure compactness and grain sizes. Typical strategies for preparing these three forms of halide perovskites are also reviewed.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Crystalline Fullerene Micro&#8208;/Nano&#8208;Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular assembly of fullerene molecules into fullerene micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;architectures with desired morphologies and structures can modulate the properties of fullerenes at different dimension scales, targeting diverse applications in such fields as electronics, biology, and energy storage/conversion. This purpose requires efficient strategies to well&#8208;control the seemingly unpredictable and random process as discussed in this review.








Abstract
Fullerenes are a molecular form of carbon allotrope and bear certain solubility, which allow the supramolecular assembly of fullerene molecules&#8212;also together with other complementary compound classes&#8212;via solution&#8208;based wet processes. By well&#8208;programmed organizing these building blocks and precisely modulating over the assembly process, supramolecularly assembled fullerene micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;architectures (FMNAs) are obtained. These FMNAs exhibit remarkably enhanced functions as well as tunable morphologies and dimensions at different size scales, leading to their applications in diverse fields. In this review, both traditional and newly developed assembly strategies are reviewed, with an emphasis on the morphological evolution mechanism of FMNAs. The discussion is then focused on how to precisely regulate the dimensions and morphologies to generate functional FMNAs through solvent engineering, co&#8208;crystallization, surfactant incorporation, or post&#8208;fabrication treatment. In addition to C60&#8208;based FMNAs, this review particularly focuses on recently fabricated FMNAs comprising higher fullerenes (e.g., C70) and metallofullerenes. Meanwhile, an overview of the property modulation is presented and multidisciplinary applications of FMNAs in various fields are summarized, including sensors, optoelectronics, biomedicines, and energy. At the end, the prospects for future research, application opportunities, and challenges associated with FMNAs are proposed.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Based Membranes for Safe Lithium/Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices have attracted extensive interest because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. The most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes in lithium/sodium batteries are summarized. In addition, the current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Alkali (lithium, sodium)&#8208;based second batteries are considered one of the brightest candidates for energy&#8208;storage applications in order to utilize the random and intermittent renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality. Conventional lithium/sodium batteries containing liquid organic electrolytes are vulnerable to electrolytes leakage and even combustion, which hinders their large&#8208;scale and reliable application. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes which are considered to have better safety have been developed in recent years. However, most of them suffer from low ionic conductivity and large interfacial resistance with the electrode. Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices, have attracted much attention because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. This review focuses on the most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes that sprang up with the emerging demand and progress of safe lithium/sodium batteries. The ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes are discussed based on the framework components and preparation methods. Their structure and properties, including ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, electrochemical stabilities, and so on, are demonstrated in combination with their applications. The current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are also proposed.

Over the last decade, extensive efforts have been made on utilizing advanced materials and structures to improve the properties and functionalities of flexible electronics. While the conventional ways are approaching their natural limits, a revolutionary strategy, namely metamaterials, is emerging toward engineering structural materials to break the existing fetters. Metamaterials exhibit supernatural physical behaviors, in aspects of mechanical, optical, thermal, acoustic, and electronic properties that are inaccessible in natural materials, such as tunable stiffness or Poisson's ratio, manipulating electromagnetic or elastic waves, and topological and programmable morphability. These salient merits motivate metamaterials as a brand&#8208;new research direction and have inspired extensive innovative applications in flexible electronics. Here, such a groundbreaking interdisciplinary field is first coined as &#8220;flexible metamaterial electronics,&#8221; focusing on enhancing and innovating functionalities of flexible electronics via the design of metamaterials. Herein, the latest progress and trends in this infant field are reviewed while highlighting their potential value. First, a brief overview starts with introducing the combination of metamaterials and flexible electronics. Then, the developed applications are discussed, such as self&#8208;adaptive deformability, ultrahigh sensitivity, and multidisciplinary functionality, followed by the discussion of potential prospects. Finally, the challenges and opportunities facing flexible metamaterial electronics to advance this cutting&#8208;edge field are summarized.

         <title>Effective Approaches for Designing Stable M&#8211;Nx/C Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Catalysts for Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective approaches for designing stable M&#8211;Nx/C non&#8208;precious&#8208;metal oxygen&#8208;reduction catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells are summarized. The thermodynamics and kinetics aspects of the stability of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are introduced. The primary degradation mechanisms of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail, with future perspectives highlighted.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is extremely limited by their costly platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) catalysts, which are used for catalyzing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. Among the reported PGM&#8208;free catalysts so far, metal&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (M&#8211;Nx/C) catalysts hold a great potential to replace PGMs catalysts for the ORR due to their excellent initial activity and low cost. However, despite tremendous progress in this field in the past decade, their further applications are restricted by fast degradation under practical conditions. Herein, the theoretical fundamentals of the stability of the M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are first introduced in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. The primary degradation mechanisms of M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail. Finally, the current challenges and the prospects for designing highly stable M&#8211;Nx/C catalysts are outlined.

         <title>Structural Reconstruction of Catalysts in Electroreduction Reaction: Identifying, Understanding, and Manipulating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fundamental insights of the structural reconstruction in electroreduction catalysts is illustrated. Special attention is paid to efficient strategies to design satisfactory cathodic catalysts including the modulation of its component and morphological features for resolving the internal inducements, the regulation of the electrolytes, gas atmosphere, and potential for resisting the external inducements.








Abstract
Electroreduction transformation of small molecules (CO2, N2, and H2O) into chemical feedstocks offers a promising approach to eliminate carbon emissions and harness renewable energy. Most cathodic catalysts often undergo structural transformation under operating electroreduction conditions. These structural reconstructions are reflected in changes in their catalytic activity. In&#8208;depth understanding of the change of active sites and influence parameters of reconstruction behaviors is an essential precondition for the design of highly efficient catalysts. Despite the previous achievements, comprehensive insight toward the structural evolution mechanism in cathodic catalysts, compared to anode ones, under reaction conditions is still lacking. Herein, an overview of structural reconstruction for cathodic catalysts in terms of fundamental mechanisms, reconstruction process, advanced characterizations, and influencing parameters is provided. On this basis, the typical strategies for manipulating the structural reconfiguration of catalysts are also explicitly discussed from the catalyst structure and working environment. By delivering the mechanism, strategies, insights, and techniques, this review will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural reconstruction of cathodic catalysts in electroreduction reactions and future guidelines for their rational development.

To begin, an introduction to fundamentals of AM and PAEKs, as well as the advantages of AM of PAEKs is provided. Discussions are then presented on the material properties, AM processes, processing&#8211;matter coupling mechanism, thermal conductivity, crystallization characteristics, and microstructures of AM&#8208;processed PAEKs. Thereafter, the mechanical properties and anisotropy of additively manufactured PAEKs are discussed in depth. Their representative applications in biomedical, aerospace, electronics, and other fields are systematically presented. Finally, current challenges and possible solutions are discussed for the future development of high&#8208;performance AM polymers.

         <title>Roles of MXene in Pressure Sensing: Preparation, Composite Structure Design, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D layered nanosheet MXene has been widely studied in pressure sensing due to the excellent mechanical and electrical properties, outstanding hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. To further promote the application of MXene in pressure sensors, the preparation of MXene, MXene&#8208;based microstructures, MXene pressure&#8208;sensor mechanisms, and the integration of multiple devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), robotics, and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXene, a red&#8208;hot member of the 2D nanomaterials, has brought a brand&#8208;new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in the field of pressure sensing and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply pressure sensing to many fields, such as e&#8208;skin flexibility. Herein, the preparation technologies, antioxidant methods, and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene&#8208;based microstructures is introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, and composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensors are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in future e&#8208;skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.

         <title>Challenges and Perspectives of Organic Multivalent Metal&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The challenges faced by organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries and the possible strategies to solve such challenges are summarized. As a special challenge that organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) are facing, the charge&#8208;storage mechanism is particularly underlined. The perspectives are thereby elaborated with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.








Abstract
Rechargeable organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) have attracted a surge of interest as promising alternatives for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications because they can combine the advantages of both organic electrodes and multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of organic MMIBs is hampered by many factors, which mean they lag far behind organic alkali&#8208;metal&#8208; (e.g., Li&#8208;, Na&#8208;, and K&#8208;) ion batteries. Herein, the challenges that are specifically faced by organic MMIBs are analyzed and the strategies that can probably solve such challenges are then discussed. As a special challenge that organic MMIBs are facing, the charge&#8208;storage mechanism is particularly underlined to deeply understand the structure&#8211;property relationships for guiding the future design of high&#8208;performance organic electrodes for MMIBs. The perspectives are thereby elaborated in this review with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.

         <title>Advances on Thermally Conductive Epoxy&#8208;Based Composites as Electronic Packaging Underfill Materials&#8212;A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 52, December 28, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underfill materials with high thermal conductivity play crucial roles in ensuring the reliability and performance of microelectronic devices. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to meet the key requirements of capillary underfill materials are reviewed. Perspectives and an outlook for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging are provided.








Abstract
The integrated circuits industry has been continuously producing microelectronic components with ever higher integration level, packaging density, and power density, which demand more stringent requirements for heat dissipation. Electronic packaging materials are used to pack these microelectronic components together, help to dissipate heat, redistribute stresses, and protect the whole system from the environment. They serve an important role in ensuring the performance and reliability of the electronic devices. Among various packaging materials, epoxy&#8208;based underfills are often employed in flip&#8208;chip packaging. However, widely used capillary underfill materials suffer from their low thermal conductivity, unable to meet the growing heat dissipation required of next&#8208;generation IC chips with much higher power density. Many strategies have been proposed to improve the thermal conductivity of epoxy, but its application as underfill materials with complex performance requirements is still difficult. In fact, optimizing the combined thermal&#8211;electrical&#8211;mechanical&#8211;processing properties of underfill materials for flip&#8208;chip packaging remains a great challenge. Herein, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances that have been made to satisfy the key requirements of capillary underfill materials are reviewed. Based on these studies, the perspectives for designing high&#8208;performance underfill materials with novel microstructures in electronic packaging for high&#8208;power density electronic devices are provided.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controlled extraction emulsion process (CrEEP) allows the synthesis of monodisperse latex particles with a continuous size gradient. Subsequent self&#8208;assembly into a photonic glass results in a thin film with a continuous photonic gradient and structural colors ranging over the full visible spectrum. This concept is shown to improve the broadband reflectance of such a mesostructure compared to a non&#8208;gradient&#160;mixture.








Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8211;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. First, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Second, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and in superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.

         <title>2D Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical synthesis and functionalization of 2D germananes (hydrogen atom and covalent group(s) termination) via topotactical deintercalation offer customizable properties or new functionalities. The fundamentals from synthesis and exfoliation to properties; for optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical applications are reviewed. The review presents the recent progress and challenges, and provides insight for future exploration of these materials.








Abstract
In the realm of 2D layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp2&#8211;sp3&#8208;hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe2, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca2+, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. The preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer germananes, are comprehensively covered. The progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas are reviewed. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.

         <title>Photomagnetically Powered Spiky Nanomachines with Thermal Control of Viscosity for Enhanced Cancer Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pronged driving strategy of nanomachines by simultaneously enhancing magnetic forces and reducing viscous forces is proposed here. The photomagnetically powered nanomachines with spiky surface exhibit a thermally dependent viscosity tunability and coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic perception, which facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for enhanced cancer mechanotherapy. This work shines a light on designing intelligent nanomachine&#8208;based mechanotherapy for clinical translation.








Abstract
Nanomachines with active propulsion have emerged as an intelligent platform for targeted cancer therapy. Achieving an efficient locomotion performance using an external energy conversion is a key requirement in the design of nanomachines. In this study, inspired by diverse spiky structures in nature, a photomagnetically powered nanomachine (PMN) with a spiky surface and thermally dependent viscosity tunability is proposed to facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for cancer mechanotherapy. The hybrid nanomachine is integrated with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and covered with gold nanotips. Physical simulations and experimental results prove that the spiky structure endows nanomachines with an obvious photomagnetic coupling effect in the NIR&#8208;II region through the alignment and orienting movement of plasmons on the gold tips. Using a coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic field, PMNs are efficiently assembled into chain&#8208;like structures to further elevate energy conversion efficiency. Notably, PMNs with the thermal control of viscosity are efficiently propelled under simultaneously applied dual external energy sources in cell lysosomes. Enhanced mechanical destruction of cancer cells via PMNs is confirmed both in vitro and in vivo under photomagnetic treatment. This study provides a new direction for designing integrated nanomachines with active adaptability to physiological environments for cancer treatment.

         <title>Unconventional Spin State Driven Spontaneous Magnetization in a Praseodymium Iron Antimonide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel rare&#8208;earth transition metal antimonide Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization when cooled without external magnetic field, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. Below 40&#160;K, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. The spin structure is studied by magnetic measurements, spectroscopy, and diffraction.








Abstract
Consolidating a microscopic understanding of magnetic properties is crucial for a rational design of magnetic materials with tailored characteristics. The interplay of 3d and 4f magnetism in rare&#8208;earth transition metal antimonides is an ideal platform to search for such complex behavior. Here the synthesis, crystal growth, structure, and complex magnetic properties are reported of the new compound Pr3Fe3Sb7 as studied by magnetization and electrical transport measurements in static and pulsed magnetic fields up to 56&#160;T, powder neutron diffraction, and M&#246;&#223;bauer spectroscopy. On cooling without external magnetic field, Pr3Fe3Sb7 shows spontaneous magnetization, indicating a symmetry breaking without a compensating domain structure. The Fe substructure exhibits noncollinear ferromagnetic order below the Curie temperature TC&#160;&#8776;&#160;380 K. Two spin orientations exist, which approximately align along the Fe&#8211;Fe bond directions, one parallel to the ab plane and a second one with the moments canting away from the c axis. The Pr substructure orders below 40&#160;K, leading to a spin&#8208;reorientation transition (SRT) of the iron substructure. In low fields, the Fe and Pr magnetic moments order antiparallel to each other, which gives rise to a magnetization antiparallel to the external field. At 1.4&#160;K, the magnetization approaches saturation above 40&#160;T. The compound exhibits metallic resistivity along the c axis, with a small anomaly at the SRT.

Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, we engineered and demonstrated a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, we fabricated FGA with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>Hybridization Engineering of Oxyfluoride Aluminosilicate Glass for Construction of Dual&#8208;Phase Optical Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The construction of transparent ceramics under mild conditions under 1000&#176;C and standard atmospheric pressure has great scientific and technological potential; however, it remains difficult to achieve when conventional ceramic sintering techniques are used. Herein, we present a mild strategy for constructing dual&#8208;phase optical ceramics with high crystallinity (&gt;90%) based on the stepped dual&#8208;phase crystallization of hybridized aluminosilicate glass. Theoretical and experimental studies reveal that the hybridization of the glass system enables a new balance between the glass&#8208;forming ability and crystallization and can overcome the uncontrolled devitrification phenomenon during the dense crystallization of glass. Transparent hybridized oxide&#8208;fluoride ceramics with fiber geometry and dual&#8208;phase microstructures are also successfully fabricated. The generality of the strategy is confirmed, and transparent ceramics with various chemical compositions and phase combinations are prepared. Additionally, the cross section of the ceramic fibers can be easily tuned into a circle, square, trapezoid, and even a triangle. Furthermore, the practical applications of the optical ceramics for lighting and X&#8208;ray imaging are demonstrated. The findings described here suggest a major step toward expanding the scope of optical ceramics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, we first discover that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the STING agonist MSA&#8208;2, and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. We next co&#8208;assembled acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>Multifunctional Interphase Layer Enabling Superior Sodium Metal Battery under Ambient Temperature and &#8208;40 &#176;C</title>

Abstract
Sodium (Na) metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low&#8208;cost is promising to construct high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal battery. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and liquid electrolyte induces tardily ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultra&#8208;low temperature (&#8208;40 &#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na2Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na2Se/V) via an in&#8208;situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na2Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling lifespan of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/1 mAh cm&#8722;2) in carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte. More remarkably, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the artificial Na2Se/V hybrid interphase can accelerate the desolvation of solvated Na+ at &#8208;40 &#176;C. The Na@Na2Se/V electrode thus exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance in symmetric cell (over 1500&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2/0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2) and full cell (over 700 cycles at 0.5 C) at &#8208;40 &#176;C. This work provides an avenue to design artificial heterogeneous interphase layer for superior high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries at ambient and ultra&#8208;low temperatures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium (Na) metal anode with high theoretical capacity and low-cost is promising to construct high-energy-density metal battery. However, the unsatisfactory interface between Na and liquid electrolyte induces tardily ion transfer kinetics and dendritic Na growth, especially at ultra-low temperature (-40 &#176;C). Herein, an artificial heterogeneous interphase consisting of disodium selenide (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se) and metal vanadium (V) is produced on the surface of Na (Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V) via an in-situ spontaneous chemical reaction. Such interphase layer possesses high sodiophilicity, excellent ionic conductivity and high Young's modulus, which can promote Na ion adsorption and transport, realizing homogenous Na deposition without dendrites. The symmetric Na@Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se/V cell exhibits outstanding cycling lifespan of over 1790&#160;h (0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;/1 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in carbonate-based electrolyte.

         <title>Carbon&#8208;hybridized Hydroxides for Energy Conversion and Storage: Interface Chemistry and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As novel and promising materials, carbon&#8208;hybridized hydroxides (CHHs) have been intensively investigated for uses in the energy conversion/storage fields. Nevertheless, the intrinsic structure&#8208;activity relationships between carbon and hydroxides within CHHs are still blurry, which hinders the fine modulation of CHHs in terms of practical applications to some degree. This review aims to figure out the intrinsic role of carbon materials in CHHs with a focus on the interface chemistry and the engineering strategy in&#8208;between two components. The fundamental effects of the carbon materials in enhancing the charge/mass transfer kinetics are firstly analyzed, particularly the extra electron pathways for fast charge transfer and the anchoring sites for boosting the mass transfer. Subsequently, the surface&#8208;guided/confined effects of carbon materials in CHHs to modify the morphology and tailor the hydroxides, and functional heterojunction for regulating the inner electronic structure are decoupled simultaneously. The fabrication methods to efficiently construct a stable yet robust solid&#8208;solid heterointerface are summarized, including oxygen functional groups engrafting, topological defective&#8208;sites construction, and heteroatom incorporation to activate the inert carbon surface. The smart CHHs in some typical energy applications are demonstrated. Additionally, the methodologies that can reveal the hybridization electron configuration between two components are summed up. At last, the perspective and challenges faced by the CHHs for energy&#8208;related applications are outlined and discussed.

         <title>Semi&#8208;transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semitransparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. We observe a reversal of circular selectivity in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Trojan Horse Nanocapsule Enabled in Situ Modulation of the Phenotypic Conversion of Th17 Cells to Treg Cells for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Th17/Treg imbalance is closely related to the occurrence and development of multiple sclerosis (MS), and the transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into Treg cells may contribute to the resolution of inflammation, presenting a therapeutic strategy for MS. To modulate this phenotypic shift in situ, we report a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221;&#8208;like hybrid system, nanocapsule&#8208;coupled Th17 cells, for MS treatment. Following intravenous injection into MS mice, the hybrid system efficiently transmigrated across the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and homed to the inflamed MS niche. Aminooxy&#8208;acetic acid (AOA), a transdifferentiation inducer, was locally released upon the production of ROS and in turn taken up by Th17 cells. We demonstrated that the Trojan horse hybrid system enabled in situ phenotypic transdifferentiation of Th17 cells into anti&#8208;inflammatory Treg cells. This phenotypic conversion led to a domino&#8208;like immune response that was conducive to MS therapy. Overall, this work highlights a new pathway for accurate modulation of the phenotypes of adoptively transferred cells in situ, from proinflammatory to anti&#8208;inflammatory for MS therapy, and may be broadly applicable for patients suffering from other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained Snapping Drives Autonomous Dancing and Motion in Free&#8208;Standing Wavy Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and motion remains challenging in autonomous systems. Harnessing wavy ribbon rings for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer rings under constant temperature and light are reported. It drives continuous flipping for either periodic self&#8208;dancing in place in symmetric rings or self&#8208;crawling in asymmetric rings on the ground and underwater, as well as self&#8208;escaping from confined spaces.








Abstract
Harnessing snapping, an instability phenomenon observed in nature (e.g., Venus flytraps), for autonomy has attracted growing interest in autonomous soft robots. However, achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and snapping&#8208;driven autonomous motions in soft robots remains largely unexplored. Here, harnessing bistable, ribbon ring&#8208;like structures for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in a library of soft liquid&#8208;crystal elastomer wavy rings under constant thermal and photothermal actuation are reported. The self&#8208;sustained snapping induces continuous ring flipping that drives autonomous dancing or crawling motions on the ground and underwater. The 3D, free&#8208;standing wavy rings employ either a highly symmetric or symmetry&#8208;broken twisted shape with tunable geometric asymmetries. It is found that the former favors periodic self&#8208;dancing motion in place due to isotropic friction, while the latter shows a directional crawling motion along the predefined axis of symmetry during fabrication due to asymmetric friction. It shows that the crawling speed can be tuned by the geometric asymmetries with a peak speed achieved at the highest geometric asymmetry. Lastly, it is shown that the autonomous crawling ring can also adapt its body shape to pass through a confined space that is over 30% narrower than its body size.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Design of the Metal&#8211;Organic Framework DUT&#8208;8(M)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pillared layer metal&#8211;organic frameworks can be tuned along a time axis by adjusting the ratio of nickel and cobalt in the paddle wheel node. Advanced in&#160;situ methodologies reveal switching rates ranging from 1 to 200 s. Individual crystal observations in a microfluidic device reveal prolonged induction time in particular for highly cobalt substituted frameworks.








Abstract
Switchable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) change their structure in time and selectively open their pores adsorbing guest molecules, leading to highly selective separation, pressure amplification, sensing, and actuation applications. The 3D engineering of MOFs has reached a high level of maturity, but spatiotemporal evolution opens a new perspective toward engineering materials in the 4th dimension (time) by t&#8208;axis design, in essence exploiting the deliberate tuning of activation barriers. This work demonstrates the first example in which an explicit temporal engineering of a switchable MOF (DUT&#8208;8, [M1M2(2,6&#8208;ndc)2dabco]n, 2,6&#8208;ndc = 2,6&#8208;naphthalene dicarboxylate, dabco = 1,4diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, M1&#160;= Ni, M2&#160;= Co) is presented. The temporal response is deliberately tuned by variations in cobalt content. A spectrum of advanced analytical methods is presented for analyzing the switching kinetics stimulated by vapor adsorption using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved techniques ranging from ensemble adsorption and advanced synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction experiments to individual crystal analysis. A novel analysis technique based on microscopic observation of individual crystals in a microfluidic channel reveals the lowest limit for adsorption switching reported so far. Differences in the spatiotemporal response of crystal ensembles originate from an induction time that varies statistically and widens characteristically with increasing cobalt content reflecting increasing activation barriers.

         <title>Surface Hydrophobization Provides Hygroscopic Supramolecular Plastics Based on Polysaccharides with Damage&#8208;Specific Healability and Room&#8208;Temperature Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface hydrophobization strategy is offered to achieve damage&#8208;specific healing for hygroscopic supramolecular plastic films. The surface alkylation protects the intact surface of the films from water&#8208;induced plasticization, which eliminates random self&#8208;adhesion. Thus, self&#8208;adhesion exclusively occurs at the damage sites, where fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose, leading to damage&#8208;specific healing.








Abstract
Supramolecular materials with room&#8208;temperature healability and recyclability are highly desired because they can extend materials lifetimes and reduce resources consumption. Most approaches toward healing and recycling rely on the dynamically reversible supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen, ionic and coordinate bonds, which are hygroscopic and vulnerable to water. The general water&#8208;induced plasticization facilitates the healing and reprocessing process but cause a troubling problem of random self&#8208;adhesion. To address this issue, here it is reported that by modifying the hygroscopic surfaces with hydrophobic alkyl chains of dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS), supramolecular plastic films based on commercial raw materials of sodium alginate (SA) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) display extraordinary damage&#8208;specific healability. Owing to the hydrophobic surfaces, random self&#8208;adhesion is eliminated even under humid environment. When damage occurs, the fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose exclusively at the damaged site. Thus, damage&#8208;specific healing can be readily facilitated by water&#8208;induced plasticization. Moreover, the films display excellent room&#8208;temperature recyclability. After multiple times of reprocessing and re&#8208;modifying with DTMS, the rejuvenated films exhibit fatigueless mechanical properties. It is anticipated that this approach to damage&#8208;specific healing and room&#8208;temperature recycling based on surface hydrophobization can be applied to design various of supramolecular plastic polysaccharides materials for building sustainable societies.

&lt;p&gt;A novel surface hydrophobization strategy is offered to achieve damage-specific healing for hygroscopic supramolecular plastic films. The surface alkylation protects the intact surface of the films from water-induced plasticization, which eliminates random self-adhesion. Thus, self-adhesion exclusively occurs at the damage sites, where fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose, leading to damage-specific healing.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilization and Performance Enhancement Strategies for Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into the recently emerged stability and activity enhancement strategies, widely applicable to the design and development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts for H2 evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and organic synthesis reactions, is provided.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;energy&#8208;powered photocatalytic fuel production and chemical synthesis are widely recognized as viable technological solutions for a sustainable energy future. However, the requirement of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts is a major bottleneck. Halide perovskites, a category of diversified semiconductor materials with suitable energy&#8208;band&#8208;enabled high&#8208;light&#8208;utilization efficiencies, exceptionally long charge&#8208;carrier&#8208;diffusion&#8208;length&#8208;facilitated charge transport, and readily tailorable compositional, structural, and morphological properties, have emerged as a new class of photocatalysts for efficient hydrogen evolution, CO2 reduction, and various organic synthesis reactions. Despite the noticeable progress, the development of high&#8208;performance halide perovskite photocatalysts (HPPs) is still hindered by several key challenges: the strong ionic nature and high hydrolysis tendency induce instability and an unsatisfactory activity due to the need for a coactive component to realize redox processes. Herein, the recently developed advanced strategies to enhance the stability and photocatalytic activity of HPPs are comprehensively reviewed. The widely applicable stability enhancement strategies are first articulated, and the activity improvement strategies for fuel production and chemical synthesis are then explored. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives associated with the application of HPPs in efficient production of fuels and value&#8208;added chemicals are presented, indicating the irreplaceable role of the HPPs in the field of photocatalysis.

         <title>Rationally Reconstructed Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Robust Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The successful fabrication of robust oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalyst, through reconstruction of the metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) framework structure from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe type to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH type by means of an in situ coordination transformation of the active sites, is reported. The resulting eg&#8211;t2g crystal&#8208;field splitting of the Fe&#8208;3d orbitals in the MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH is so small as to guarantee the efficient OER with lowered overpotential at the rate&#8208;determining step.








Abstract
Reconstructing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOFs) toward a designed framework structure provides breakthrough opportunities to achieve unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance, but has rarely, if ever, been proposed and investigated yet. Here, the first successful fabrication of a robust OER electrocatalyst by precision reconstruction of an MOF structure is reported, viz., from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with different coordination environments at the active sites. Due to the radically reduced eg&#8211;t2g crystal&#8208;field splitting in Fe&#8208;3d and the much suppressed electron&#8208;hopping barriers through the synergistic effects of the O species the efficient OER of in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH is guaranteed. Benefiting from this desired electronic structure, the designed MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH catalyst exhibits high intrinsic OER activity, including a low overpotential of 215 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 45.4 mV dec&#8722;1 and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.44 s&#8722;1 at 300 mV overpotential, over 80 times that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (0.0177 s&#8722;1).Consistent with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the real&#8208;time kinetic simulation reveals that the conversion from O* to OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step on the active sites of MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH.

         <title>Thermally Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic ions in the hydrothermal deposition lead to deep&#8208;level defects with high formation energy, while post&#8208;annealing with prolonged time enables defect transformation from high to low formation energy. A general principle regarding kinetically and thermodynamically controlled defect formation is uncovered and a guidance for materials synthesis is provided.








Abstract
Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cell films is presented. A top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film is adopted in this study to consolidate this investigation. This study reveals that, under hydrothermal conditions, the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S,Se)3 film generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: 1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by 2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8211;anion antisite defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

         <title>A Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) is demonstrated as an efficient &#960;&#8208;linker for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells. Endowed with the hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination, yielding a record power conversion efficiency of 13.2% and an outstanding stability under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h.








Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers are presented, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

As a result, &lt;b&gt;ZS4&lt;/b&gt;-based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5G sunlight, with a high short-circuit photocurrent density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 16.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, an open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with &lt;b&gt;ZS4&lt;/b&gt; exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. It is believed that&#160;this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper-electrolyte-based DSCs using a single sensitizer. The work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicolor and 3D Holography Generated by Inverse&#8208;Designed Single&#8208;Cell Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Metasurface&#8208;generated holography has emerged as a promising route for fully reproducing vivid scenes by manipulating the optical properties of light using ultra&#8208;compact devices. However, achieving multiple holographic images using a single metasurface is still difficult due to the capacity limit of a single meta&#8208;atom. In this work, we&#160;present an inverse design method based on gradient&#8208;descent optimization to encode multiple pieces of holographic information into a single metasurface. The proposed method allows the inverse design of single&#8208;cell metasurfaces without the need for complex meta&#8208;atom design strategies, facilitating high&#8208;throughput fabrication using broadband low&#8208;loss materials. By exploiting the proposed design method, both multiplane RGB color and 3D holograms are designed and experimentally demonstrated. We&#160;achieve multiplane RGB color holograms with nine distinct holograms, demonstrating the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art data capacity of a phase&#8208;only metasurface. We&#160;also present the first experimental demonstration of metasurface&#8208;generated 3D holograms with completely independent and distinct images in each plane. The current research findings provide a viable route for practical metasurface&#8208;generated holography by demonstrating the high&#8208;density holography produced by a single metasurface. It is expected to ultimately lead to optical storage, display, and full&#8208;color imaging&#160;applications.

         <title>Low&#8208;Coordination Trimetallic PtFeCo Nanosaws for Practical Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance catalysts for fuel cell catalysis is one of the most critical and challenging steps for the commercialization of fuel cell technology. Here one&#8208;dimensional trimetallic platinum&#8208;iron&#8208;cobalt nanosaws (Pt3FeCo NSs) with low&#8208;coordination features were designed as efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for practical fuel cell catalysis. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of Pt3FeCo NSs (10.62&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 4.66 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90&#160;V) is more than 25 folds higher than that of the commercial Pt/C, even after 30000 voltage cycles. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the strong inter&#8208;d&#8208;orbital electron transfer minimizes the ORR barrier with even higher selectivity at robust valence states. The volcano correlation between the intrinsic structure featured with low&#8208;coordination Pt&#8208;sites and corresponding electronic activities is discovered, which guarantees high ORR activities. The Pt3FeCo NSs located in the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) also achieve very high peak power density (1800.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) and competitive specific/mass activities (1.79&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.79 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free cell voltage) as well as a long&#8208;term lifetime in specific H2&#8208;O2 medium for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), ranking top electrocatalysts reported to date for MEA. This work represents a class of multimetallic Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts for practical fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Oral Delivery of siRNA Using Fluorinated, Small&#8208;Sized Nanocapsules Toward Anti&#8208;Inflammation Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Oral delivery of siRNA provides a promising paradigm for treating diseases that require regular injections. However, the multiple gastrointestinal and systemic barriers often lead to inefficient oral absorption and low bioavailability of siRNA. Technologies that can overcome these barriers are still lacking, which hurdles the clinical potential of orally delivered siRNA. Herein, small&#8208;sized, fluorinated nanocapsules (F&#8208;NCs) were developed to mediate efficient oral delivery of TNF&#8208;&#945; siRNA for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment. The NCs possessed a disulfide&#8208;cross&#8208;linked shell structure, thus featuring robust stability in the gastrointestinal tract. Because of their small size (&#8764;30 nm) and fluorocarbon&#8208;assisted repelling of mucin adsorption, the best&#8208;performing F3&#8208;NCs showed excellent mucus penetration and intestinal transport capabilities without impairing the intestinal tight junction, conferring the oral bioavailability of 20.4% in relative to i.v. injection. The disulfide cross&#8208;linker could be cleaved inside target cells, causing NCs dissociation and siRNA release to potentiate the TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing efficiency. In murine models of acute and chronic inflammation, orally delivered F3&#8208;NCs provoked efficient TNF&#8208;&#945; silencing and pronounced anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacies. This study therefore provides a transformative strategy for oral siRNA delivery, and would render promising utilities for anti&#8208;inflammation treatment.

         <title>Reconfigurable Electrical Networks within A Conductive Hydrogel Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Soft materials that exhibit the compliance, programmability, and reconfigurability could have transformative impact as electronic skin for applications in wearable electronics/soft robotics. There has been significant progress in soft conductive materials; however, achieving electrically&#8208;controlled and reversible changes in conductivity and circuit connectivity remains challenging. To overcome this limitation, we present soft material architecture with reconfigurable conductive networks of silver flakes embedded within a hydrogel matrix. The conductive networks can be reversibly created/disconnected through various stimuli, including current, humidity, or temperature. Such stimuli affect electrical connectivity of the hydrogel by controlling its water content, which can be modulated by evaporation under ambient conditions (passive dehydration), evaporation through electrical Joule heating (active dehydration), or absorption of additional water (rehydration). Through passive dehydration, the volume fraction of conductive fillers increases as water evaporates, enhancing electrical conductivity. Applying electrical power across the composite accelerates water evaporation and forms conductive pathways faster with greater connectivity than composites subjected to passive dehydration. Alternatively, the percolating networks of silver flakes can be disrupted when the hydrogel absorbs water. The resulting change in electrical conductivity is reversible and repeatable, endowing the composite with on&#8208;demand reconfigurable conductivity. To highlight this material's unique properties, we show that conductive traces can be reconfigured after severe damage and revert to lower conductivity after rehydration. Additionally, we demonstrate a quadruped robot that can respond to stimuli by changing direction following exposure to excess water, thereby achieving reprogrammable locomotion behaviors.

         <title>Chemical Tuning Meets 2D Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical tuning including lithiation control and solvent coordination can significantly modify magnetic interaction in molecule&#8208;based magnets for high&#8208;temperature magnetic order and large coercivity. Through those technical routes and processing, 2D molecule&#8208;based magnets with an applicable magnetic performance of ferrites are demonstrated. The considerable energy product evidences its worth for obtaining practical molecule&#8208;based magnets.








Abstract
2D magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#183;xLiCl&#183;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

Until recently, the crucial metal-organic magnet Cr(pyz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;LiCl&#183;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;THF with considerable high coercivity and high-temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal-organic materials at room temperature. Here, an in&#8211;situ chemical tuning route is reported to realize the controllable transformation of low-temperature magnetic order into room-temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;LiCl&#183;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;THF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room-temperature optimum performance of coercivity (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room-temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr-pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Nano&#8208;Optogenetic Activation of Cancer Immunotherapy via Engineered Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 is designed to specifically release encoded flagellin B (flaB) in response to near&#8208;infrared light for tumor&#8208;specific nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm irradiation, flaB activates the immune response via binding to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 in tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to induce significant tumor regression in different tumor models.








Abstract
Certain anaerobic microbes with the capability to colonize the tumor microenvironment tend to express the heterologous gene in a sustainable manner, which will inevitably compromise the therapeutic efficacy and induce off&#8208;tumor toxicity in vivo. To improve the therapeutic precision and controllability of bacteria&#8208;based therapeutics, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), engineered to sense blue light and release the encoded flagellin B (flaB), is conjugated with lanthanide upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) for near&#8208;infrared (NIR) nano&#8208;optogenetic cancer immunotherapy. Upon 808&#160;nm photoirradiation, UCNPs emit at the blue region to photoactivate the EcN for secretion of flaB, which subsequently binds to Toll&#8208;like receptor 5 expressed on the membrane of macrophages for activating immune response via MyD88&#8208;dependent signal pathway. Such synergism leads to significant tumor regression in different tumor models and metastatic tumors with negligible side effects. These studies based on the NIR nano&#8208;optogenetic platform highlight the rational of leveraging the optogenetic tools combined with natural propensity of certain bacteria for cancer immunotherapy.

A series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs)&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scintillators is developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. High&#8208;efficient excitation energy transfer from the cluster&#8208;based antenna to the Ln(III) ions enables Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs and their flexible film with excellent scintillation performance and high spatial resolution of 12.6&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Scintillator&#8208;based X&#8208;ray imaging has attracted great attention from industrial quality inspection and security to medical diagnostics. Herein, a series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs)&#8208;based X&#8208;ray scintillators are developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the heavy inorganic units ([Cu4I4] clusters) absorb the X&#8208;ray energy to populate triplet excitons via halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (XLCT) combined with the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge&#8208;transfer (MLCT) state (defined as the X/MLCT state), and then the 3X/MLCT excited state sensitizes Tb3+ for intense X&#8208;ray&#8208;excited luminescence via excitation energy transfer. The obtained Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOF scintillators exhibit high resistance to humidity and radiation, excellent linear response to X&#8208;ray dose rate, and high X&#8208;ray relative light yield of 29 379&#160;&#177;&#160;3000 photons MeV&#8722;1. The relative light yield of Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs is &#8776;3 times higher than that of the control Tb(III) complex. X&#8208;ray imaging tests show that the Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs&#8208;based flexible scintillator film exhibits a high spatial resolution of 12.6&#160;lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. These findings not only provide a promising design strategy to develop lanthanide&#8208;MOF&#8208;based scintillators with excellent scintillation performance, but also exhibit high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging for biological specimens and electronic chips.

         <title>Dilute Alloying to Implant Activation Centers in Nitride Electrocatalysts for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dilute alloying implants &#8220;activating&#8221; centers in nitride alloy electrocatalysts to boost lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Dilute Co dopants activate the surrounding N and Ti atoms to construct multiatom active domains for efficient bidirectional catalysis of S redox reactions. The corresponding dilute nitride alloy improves the reaction kinetics and electrochemical performance of Li&#8211;S batteries.








Abstract
Dilute alloying is an effective strategy to tune properties of solid catalysts but is rarely leveraged in complex reactions beyond small molecule conversion. In this work, dilute dopants are demonstrated to serve as activating centers to construct multiatom catalytic domains in metal nitride electrocatalysts for lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, of which the sulfur cathode suffers from sluggish and complex conversion reactions. With titanium nitride (TiN) as a model system, the dilute cobalt alloying is shown to greatly improve the reaction kinetics while inducing negligible catalyst reconstruction. Compared to the pristine TiN, the dilute nitride alloy catalyst enables onefold increase in the high rate (2.0 C) capacities of Li&#8211;S batteries, as well as an impressively low cyclic decay rate of 0.17% at a sulfur loading of 4.0 mgS cm&#8722;2. This work opens up new opportunities toward the rational design of Li&#8211;S electrocatalysts by dilute alloying and also enlightens the understandings of complex domain&#8208;catalyzed reactions in energy applications.

         <title>Fine&#8208;Tuned Ultramicroporous Metal&#8208;Organic Framework in Mixed&#8208;Matrix Membrane: Pore&#8208;Tailoring Optimization for C2H2/C2H4 Separation</title>

Abstract
Effective separation of ethyne from ethyne/ethylene (C2H2/C2H4) mixtures is a challenging and crucial industrial process. Herein, an ultramicroporous MOF platform, Cd(dicarboxylate)2(ditriazole), with triangular channels is proposed for high&#8208;efficiency separation of C2H2 from C2H4. The targeted structures are constructed via a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy by selecting different&#8208;sized ligands, allowing for tunable pore sizes and volumes. The pore properties can be further optimized by additional modification via pore environment tailoring. This concept leads to the successful synthesis of three ultramicroporous Cd&#8208;MOFs (JLU&#8208;MOF87&#8208;89). As intended, C2H2 uptake and C2H2/C2H4 selectivity gradually increase with progressively optimizing the pore structure by adjusting ligand length and substituents. JLU&#8208;MOF89, functionalized with methyl groups, features the most optimal pore chemistry, and shows selective recognition of C2H2 over C2H4, owing to the framework&#8208;C2H2 host&#8208;guest interactions. Furthermore, JLU&#8208;MOFs are fabricated into mixed&#8208;matrix membranes for C2H2/C2H4 separation. C2H2 permeability and C2H2/C2H4 permselectivity are substantially enhanced by &#8805;400% and &#8805;200%, respectively, after hybridization of JLU&#8208;MOF88 and JLU&#8208;MOF89 with a 6FDA&#8208;ODA polymer. These membranes can work efficiently and are stable under different conditions, demonstrating their potential in actual ethyne separation.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Driven Bioadhesive Triboelectric Nanogenerator for Instant Wound Sealing and Electrically Accelerated Healing in Emergencies</title>

Abstract
In this work, we design a bioadhesive triboelectric nanogenerator (BA&#8208;TENG) as a first&#8208;aid rescue for instant and robust wound sealing, and ultrasound&#8208;driven accelerated wound healing. This BA&#8208;TENG is fabricated with biocompatible materials, and integrates a flexible TENG as the top layer and bioadhesive as the bottom layer, resulting in effective electricity supply and strong sutureless sealing capability on wet tissues. When driven by ultrasound, BA&#8208;TENG can produce stable voltage of 1.50&#160;V and current of 24.20&#160;&#956;A underwater. The ex vivo porcine colon organ models showed that BA&#8208;TENG sealed defects instantly (&#8764; 5 s) with high interfacial toughness (&#8764; 150 J m&#8722;2), while the rat bleeding liver incision model confirmed that BA&#8208;TENG performed rapid wound closure and hemostasis, reducing the blood loss by 82%. When applied in living rats, BA&#8208;TENG not only sealed skin injuries immediately but also produced a strong electric field (E&#8208;field) of about 0.86&#160;kV m&#8722;1 stimulated by ultrasound to accelerate skin wound healing significantly. The in vitro studies confirmed that these effects were attributed to the E&#8208;field&#8208;accelerated cell migration and proliferation. In addition, these TENG adhesives could be applied to not only wound treatment, nerve stimulation and regeneration, and charging batteries in implanted devices.

         <title>Robust Transport:An Artificial SEI Design for Anode Free Lithium Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One of the most challenging issue in the practical implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) is the sharp capacity attenuation caused by the mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, developing an artificial SEI to address this issue remains challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness for general ionic conducting films. In this study, a tenacious composite artificial SEI with integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co&#8208;sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. The embedded LiF domain has an extremely high Young's modulus and surface energy compared with those of bulk LiPON film, enabling a significant increase in fracture toughness by an order of magnitude. Most importantly, the interface between LiPON and LiF in the integrated structure generates additional fast Li+ transport pathways, providing the artificial SEI with a conductivity higher than 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1. Consequently, the artificial SEI implementation significantly increases the cycling lifetime of the corresponding AFLMBs by more than 250%. This study highlights the importance of fracture toughness for the structural integrity of batteries and provides suggestions for designing viable SEI materials for high&#8208;performance AFLMBs.

         <title>Transformation from Magnetic Soliton to Skyrmion in a Monoaxial Chiral Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological spin textures are of great interest for both fundamental physics and applications in spintronics. The Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya (DM) interaction underpins the formation of single&#8208;twisted magnetic solitons or multi&#8208;twisted magnetic skyrmions in magnetic materials with different crystallographic symmetries. However, topological transitions between these two kinds of topological objects have not been verified experimentally. Here, we report the direct observation of transformations from a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) to magnetic skyrmions in a nanostripe of the monoaxial chiral magnet CrNb3S6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In the presence of an external magnetic field, helical spin structures first transform into CSLs and then evolve into isolated elongated magnetic skyrmions. The detailed spin textures of the elongated magnetic skyrmions are resolved using off&#8208;axis electron holography and are shown to comprise two merons, which enclose their ends and have unit total topological charge. Magnetic dipolar interactions are shown to play a key role in the magnetic soliton&#8208;skyrmion transformation, which depends sensitively on nanostripe width. Our findings, which are consistent with micromagnetic simulations, enrich the family of topological magnetic states and their transitions and promise to further stimulate the exploration of their emergent electromagnetic properties.

         <title>pH&#8208;Activatable Copper&#8208;Biomineralized Proenzyme for Synergistic Chemodynamic/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy against Aggressive Cancers</title>

Abstract
Artificial enzymes have demonstrated therapeutic benefit against diverse malignant tumors, yet their antitumor potencies are still severely compromised by non&#8208;selective catalysis, low atomic utilization efficiency, and undesired off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, we report that the peroxidase&#8208;like biomineralized copper (II) carbonate hydroxide nanocrystals inside single albumin nanocages (CuCH&#8208;NCs) act as a pH&#8208;activatable proenzyme to achieve tumor&#8208;selective and synergistic chemodynamic/chemo&#8208;immunotherapy against aggressive triple&#8208;negative breast cancers (TNBCs). These CuCH&#8208;NCs show pH&#8208;sensitive Cu2+ release, which spontaneously undergoes glutathione (GSH)&#8208;mediated reduction into Cu+ species for catalyzing the evolution of H2O2 into hydroxyl radicals in a single&#8208;atom&#8208;like manner to cause chemodynamic cell injury, and simultaneously activates non&#8208;toxic disulfiram to cytotoxic complex for yielding selective chemotherapeutic damage via blocking cell proliferation and amplifying cell apoptosis. CuCH&#8208;NCs exhibit considerable tumor&#8208;targeting capacity with deep penetration depth, thus affording preferable efficacy against orthotopic breast tumors through synergistic chemodynamic/chemotherapy, together with good in vivo safety. Moreover, CuCH&#8208;NCs arouse distinct immunogenic cell death effect and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression upon disulfiram combination, and thus synergize with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to activate adaptive and innate immunities, together with relieved immunosuppression, finally yielding potent antitumor efficacy against both primary and metastatic TNBCs. These results provide insights into smart and high&#8208;performance proenzymes for synergistic therapy against aggressive cancers.

         <title>Stable Anode&#8208;Free All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Battery through Tuned Metal Wetting on the Copper Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithiophilic Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency. An anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery employing a sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl) with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%.








Abstract
A stable anode&#8208;free all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery (AF&#8208;ASSB) with sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;electrolyte (SE) (argyrodite Li6PS5Cl) is achieved by tuning wetting of lithium metal on &#8220;empty&#8221; copper current&#8208;collector. Lithiophilic 1&#160;&#181;m Li2Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation during the first charge. The Li2Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency (CE). During continuous electrodeposition experiments using half&#8208;cells (1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), the accumulated thickness of electrodeposited Li on Li2Te&#8211;Cu is more than 70&#160;&#181;m, which is the thickness of the Li foil counter&#8208;electrode. Full AF&#8208;ASSB with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%. Cryogenic focused ion beam (Cryo&#8208;FIB) sectioning demonstrates uniform electrodeposited metal microstructure, with no signs of voids or dendrites at the collector&#8208;SE interface. Electrodissolution is uniform and complete, with Li2Te remaining structurally stable and adherent. By contrast, an unmodified Cu current&#8208;collector promotes inhomogeneous Li electrodeposition/electrodissolution, electrochemically inactive &#8220;dead metal,&#8221; dendrites that extend into SE, and thick non&#8208;uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interspersed with pores. Density functional theory (DFT) and mesoscale calculations provide complementary insight regarding nucleation&#8208;growth behavior. Unlike conventional liquid&#8208;electrolyte metal batteries, the role of current collector/support lithiophilicity has not been explored for emerging AF&#8208;ASSBs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stable anode-free all-solid-state battery (AF-ASSB) with sulfide-based solid-electrolyte (SE) (argyrodite Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl) is achieved by tuning wetting of lithium metal on &#8220;empty&#8221; copper current-collector. Lithiophilic 1&#160;&#181;m Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te is synthesized by exposing the collector to tellurium vapor, followed by in&#160;situ Li activation during the first charge. The Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te significantly reduces the electrodeposition/electrodissolution overpotentials and improves Coulombic efficiency (CE). During continuous electrodeposition experiments using half-cells (1&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the accumulated thickness of electrodeposited Li on Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&#8211;Cu is more than 70&#160;&#181;m, which is the thickness of the Li foil counter-electrode. Full AF-ASSB with NMC811&#160;cathode delivers an initial CE of 83% at 0.2C, with a cycling CE above 99%. Cryogenic focused ion beam (Cryo-FIB) sectioning demonstrates uniform electrodeposited metal microstructure, with no signs of voids or dendrites at the collector-SE interface. Electrodissolution is uniform and complete, with Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te remaining structurally stable and adherent. By contrast, an unmodified Cu current-collector promotes inhomogeneous Li electrodeposition/electrodissolution, electrochemically inactive &#8220;dead metal,&#8221; dendrites that extend into SE, and thick non-uniform solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) interspersed with pores. Density functional theory (DFT) and mesoscale calculations provide complementary insight regarding nucleation-growth behavior. Unlike conventional liquid-electrolyte metal batteries, the role of current collector/support lithiophilicity has not been explored for emerging AF-ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>m6A Reader YTHDF1&#8208;Targeting Engineered Small Extracellular Vesicles for Gastric Cancer Therapy via Epigenetic and Immune Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1)&#8208;targeting engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) inhibit gastric tumor progression and metastasis through epigenetic and immune regulation. The engineered sEVs hamper frizzled7 translation and inactivate Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner, and promote immunotherapy by direct self&#8208;presentation of immunogenic tumor and CD47&#160;blockade&#8208;based immunosuppression reversal.








Abstract
N6&#8208;methyladenosine (m6A) modulators decide the fate of m6A&#8208;modified transcripts and drive cancer development. RNA interference targeting m6A modulators promise to be an emerging cancer therapy but is challenging due to its poor tumor targeting and high systematic toxicity. Here engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) with high CD47&#160;expression and cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic (c(RGDyC)) modification are developed for effective delivery of short interfering RNA against m6A reader YTH N6&#8208;methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) to treat gastric cancer via epigenetic and immune regulation. This nanosystem efficiently depletes YTHDF1&#160;expression and suppresses gastric cancer progression and metastasis through hampering frizzled7 translation and inactivating Wnt/&#946;&#8208;catenin pathway in an m6A dependent manner. Loss of YTHDF1&#160;mediates overexpression of interferon (IFN)&#8208;&#947; receptor 1 and enhances IFN&#8208;&#947; response, promoting expression of major histocompatibility complex class I on tumor cells to achieve self&#8208;presentation of the immunogenic tumor cells to stimulate strong cytotoxic T lymphocytes responses. CD47&#160;expression on the engineered sEVs can competitively bind with signal regulatory protein &#945; to enhance phagocytosis of the tumor cells by tumor&#8208;associated macrophages. This versatile nanoplatform provides an efficient and low toxic strategy to inhibit epigenetic regulators and holds great potential in promoting immunotherapy.

         <title>A BF3&#8208;Doped MXene Dual&#8208;Layer Interphase for a Reliable Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;layer interphase consisting of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated lithium carboxylate organic layer and a thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2&#160;MXene is formed on the surface of Li&#8208;metal. The functional BF3&#160;groups along with MXene lead to a homogenous lithium deposition. The battery with the dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal as the anode shows improved electrochemical property and battery capacity retention.








Abstract
A dual&#8208;layer interphase that consists of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed lithium carboxylate organic layer and a thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene on Li metal is reported. The honeycomb&#8208;structured organic layer increases the wetting of electrolyte, leading to a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI). While the BF3&#8208;doped monolayer MXene provides abundant active sites for lithium homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in about 50% reduced thickness of inorganic&#8208;rich components among the SEI layer. A low overpotential of less than 30&#160;mV over 1000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells is received. The functional BF3&#160;groups, along with the excellent electronic conductivity and smooth surface of the MXene, greatly reduce the lithium plating/stripping energy barrier, enabling a dendrite&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal anode. The battery with this dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal as the anode displays greatly improved electrochemical performance. A high capacity&#8208;retention of 175.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1.0&#160;C is achieved after 350&#160;cycles. In a pouch cell with a capacity of 475&#160;mAh, the battery still exhibits a high discharge capacity of 165.6&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 200&#160;cycles. In contrast to the fast capacity decay of pure Li metal, the battery using NCA as the cathode also displays excellent capacity retention in both coin and pouch cells. The dual&#8208;layer modified surface provides an effective approach in stabilizing the Li&#8208;metal anode.

         <title>Unlock the Potassium Storage Behavior of Single&#8208;Phased Tungsten Selenide Nanorods via Large Cation Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, in/ex situ experiments and theoretical calculations are performed to investigate the role of tunnel cations in governing the charge storage performances of electrodes by focusing on K&#8208;ions in layer&#8208;structured WSe2. It clearly reveals that the pre&#8208;intercalated K&#8208;ions inside interlayers of WSe2 increases the electronic conductivity, and improves K&#8208;ion diffusivity, having fast kinetics response during the K&#8208;ion (de)insertion.








Abstract
Metal chalcogenide anodes with a layered structure have been regarded as potential K&#8208;based electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy density for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, their development is impeded by the slow K&#8208;ion transport kinetics and poor structural stability. In this work, the energy&#8208;storage behavior is investigated first and decisively associated them with the capacity&#8208;degradation of the promising layer&#8208;structured WSe2 from an integrated chemical and physical point of view. Then, a single&#8208;phased WSe2 with pre&#8208;intercalated high K content (SP&#8208;KxWSe2) is designed to overcome the capacity&#8208;degradation issue fundamentally. Theoretical calculations clarify the beneficial effect of K&#8208;ions inside the interlayer of WSe2 on boosting its electrochemical performance, including increasing the electronic conductivity, promoting the K&#8208;ion diffusivity, and improving the structural stability. The novel design enables the K&#8208;ions pre&#8208;intercalated WSe2 anode material to exhibit a high reversible specific capacity of 211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 and superior cycling stability (89.3% capacity retention after 5000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Especially, the K&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor, assembled from the anode of SP&#8208;KxWSe2 and the cathode of porous activated carbon, delivers superior energy&#8208;density up to 175&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, high power&#8208;density as well as exceptional cycling stability.

         <title>Bidirectional Water&#8208;Stream Behavior on a Multifunctional Membrane for Simultaneous Energy Generation and Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy generation from environmental sources such as water is mainly focused on the power generation characteristics. However, the purification technology of environmental sources are also desired techniques for recent environmental and energy global issues. In this work, bifunctional (energy generation and water purification) membranes are successfully developed by controlling the water flow directions on the membranes (electricity generation and purification membrane).








Abstract
Hydroelectric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources and polluted water. However, as conventional hydroelectric nanogenerators only utilize water resources, they cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, a water purification membrane is proposed that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (electricity generation and purification membrane (EPM)) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, the EPM exhibits high energy generation performance (maximum power 16.44&#160;&#181;W and energy 15.16&#160;mJ) by the streaming effect of water&#8208;streaming carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, by using a poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, the energy&#8208;generation performance and long&#8208;term stability are substantially improved and outstanding mechanical stability is provided, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, the EPM exhibits the water purification characteristics of &gt;90% rejection of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of &#229;ngstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposes an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next&#8208;generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.

     alt="Bidirectional Water-Stream Behavior on a Multifunctional Membrane for Simultaneous Energy Generation and Water Purification"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy generation from environmental sources such as water is mainly focused on the power generation characteristics. However, the purification technology of environmental sources are also desired techniques for recent environmental and energy global issues. In this work, bifunctional (energy generation and water purification) membranes are successfully developed by controlling the water flow directions on the membranes (electricity generation and purification membrane).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydroelectric nanogenerators have been previously proposed to recycle various water resources and polluted water. However, as conventional hydroelectric nanogenerators only utilize water resources, they cannot provide a fundamental solution for water recycling. In this study, a water purification membrane is proposed that can simultaneously generate electricity during the purification process (electricity generation and purification membrane (EPM)) for water recycling. As polluted water passes through the EPM, the water is purified in the perpendicular direction, while electricity is simultaneously produced in the horizontal direction by the movement of ions. Notably, the EPM exhibits high energy generation performance (maximum power 16.44&#160;&#181;W and energy 15.16&#160;mJ) by the streaming effect of water-streaming carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Moreover, by using a poly(acrylic acid)/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAA/CMC) binder to EPM, the energy-generation performance and long-term stability are substantially improved and outstanding mechanical stability is provided, regardless of the acidity of the water source (pH 1&#8211;10). More importantly, the EPM exhibits the water purification characteristics of &amp;gt;90% rejection of sub-10&#160;nm pollutants and potentiality of &#229;ngstrom level cation rejection, with simultaneous and continuous energy generation. Overall, this study proposes an efficient EPM model, which can be potentially used as a next-generation renewable energy generation approach, thus laying the foundation for effective utilization of polluted water resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Full Potential of Electron Acceptor Molecules for Efficient and Stable Hole Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Understanding the hole injection mechanism and improving the hole injection property are of pivotal importance in the future development of organic optoelectronic devices. Electron acceptor molecules with high electron affinity (EA) are widely used in electronic applications, such as hole injection and p&#8208;doping. Although p&#8208;doping has generally been studied in terms of matching the ionization energy (IE) of organic semiconductors with the EA of acceptor molecules, little is known about the effect of the EA of acceptor molecules on the hole injection property. Here, the hole injection mechanism in devices is completely clarified, and a strategy to optimize the hole injection property of acceptor molecules is developed. Efficient and stable hole injection is found to be possible even into materials with IEs as high as 5.8&#160;eV by controlling the charged state of an acceptor molecule with an EA of about 5.0&#160;eV. This excellent hole injection property enables direct hole injection into an emitting layer, realizing a pure blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode with an extraordinarily low turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.67&#160;V, a power efficiency of 29&#160;lm W&#8211;1, an external quantum efficiency of 28% and a Commission internationale de l&#8217;&#233;clairage y coordinate of less than 0.10.

         <title>Transition Metal Ion Doping on ZIF&#8208;8 Enhances the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atoms of optimized copper doping on ZIF&#8208;8 lead to a local effect between the Zn&#8211;N4 and Cu&#8211;N4 moieties, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency for CO2 to CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stability over 6&#160;h.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2&#160;to diverse value&#8208;added chemicals is a unique, environmentally friendly approach for curbing greenhouse gas emissions while addressing sluggish catalytic activity and low Faradaic efficiency (FE) of electrocatalysts. Here, zeolite&#8208;imidazolate&#8208;frameworks&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) containing various transition metal ions&#8212;Ni, Fe, and Cu&#8212;at varying concentrations upon doping are fabricated for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to carbon monoxide (CO) without further processing. Atom coordination environments and theoretical electrocatalytic performance are scrutinized via X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)&#160;and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Upon optimized Cu doping on ZIF&#8208;8, Cu0.5Zn0.5/ZIF&#8208;8 achieves a high partial current density of 11.57&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and maximum FE for CO of 88.5% at &#8211;1.0&#160;V (versus RHE) with a stable catalytic activity over 6&#160;h. Furthermore, the electron&#8208;rich sp2 C atom facilitates COOH* promotion after Cu doping of ZIF&#8208;8, leading to a local effect between the zinc&#8211;nitrogen&#160;(Zn&#8211;N4) and copper&#8211;nitrogen (Cu&#8211;N4) moieties. Additionally, the advanced CO2RR pathway is illustrated from various perspectives, including the pre&#8208;H&#8208;covered state under the CO2RR. The findings expand the pool of efficient metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based CO2RR catalysts, deeming them viable alternatives to conventional catalysts.

         <title>A Universal Perovskite Nanocrystal Ink for High&#8208;Performance Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional CsPbI3&#160;perovskite nanocrystal ink is developed through solution&#8208;phase ligand exchange with 3,3&#8208;diphenylpropylammonium iodide, attributed to singular stabilization by diphenyl group and rigorous surface passivation. This enables a &#8220;universal&#8221; demonstration of high&#8208;performance photovoltaics and light&#8208;emitting devices while ensuring excellent phase stability and device longevity.








Abstract
Semiconducting lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are regarded as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices due to their solution processability and outstanding optoelectronic properties. While the field of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and photovoltaics (PVs), two prime examples of optoelectronic devices, has recently seen a multitude of efforts toward high&#8208;performance PNC&#8208;based devices, realizing both devices with high efficiencies and stabilities through a single PNC processing strategy has remained a challenge. &#160;In this work, diphenylpropylammonium (DPAI) surface ligands, found through a judicious ab&#8208;initio&#8208;based ligand search, are shown to provide a solution to this problem. The universal PNC ink with DPAI ligands presented here, prepared through a solution&#8208;phase ligand&#8208;exchange process, simultaneously allows single&#8208;step processed LED and PV devices with peak electroluminescence external quantum efficiency of 17.00% and power conversion efficiency of 14.92% (stabilized output 14.00%), respectively. It is revealed that a careful design of the aromatic rings such as in DPAI is the decisive factor in bestowing such high performances, ease of solution processing, and improved phase stability up to 120&#160;days. This work illustrates the power of ligand design in producing PNC ink formulations for high&#8208;throughput production of optoelectronic devices; it also paves a path for &#8220;dual&#8208;mode&#8221; devices with both PV and LED functionalities.

         <title>Significant Zero Thermal Expansion Via Enhanced Magnetoelastic Coupling in Kagome Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero thermal expansion&#160;(ZTE) with a negligible coefficient of thermal expansion av of 2.4 ppm K&#8722;1 in a broad temperature range is achieved owing to the significant contribution of interstitial C into a Hf&#8211;Ta&#8211;Fe magnet. The corresponding mechanism of tuning normal positive thermal expansion into intriguingly ZTE via enhanced magnetoelastic coupling during magnetic transition is clarified by comprehensive property measurements, direct observation of magnetic transition, and theoretical calculations.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (ZTE) alloys, as dimensionally stable materials, are urgently required in many fields, particularly in highly advanced modern industries. In this study, high&#8208;performance ZTE with a negligible coefficient of thermal expansion av as small as 2.4&#160;ppm K&#8722;1 in a broad temperature range of 85&#8211;245 K is discovered in Hf0.85Ta0.15Fe2C0.01 magnet. It is demonstrated that the addition of trace interstitial atom C into Ta&#8208;substituted Hf0.85Ta0.15Fe2 exhibits significant capability to tune the normal positive thermal expansion&#160;into high&#8208;performance ZTE via enhanced magnetoelastic coupling in stabilized ferromagnetic structure. Moreover, direct observation of the magnetic transition between ferromagnetic and triangular antiferromagnetic states via Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, along with corresponding theoretical calculations, further uncovers the manipulation mechanism of ZTE and negative thermal expansion. A convenient and effective method to optimize thermal expansion and achieve ZTE with interstitial C addition may result in broadened applications based on the strong correlation between the magnetic properties and crystal structure.

         <dc:description>
A bioinspired design concept to endow metal films with 200% stretchability and room&#8208;temperature integration capability with diverse components is reported. By controllable implantation of defects, distinctive venation&#8208;mimicking cracking modes are induced in strained films, leading to intriguing exponential&#8208;to&#8208;linear transition of the film's electromechanical performance. Combined with room&#8208;temperature integration capability, an integrated electronic skin is constructed, showing prospects in helping disabled people.








Abstract
Future electronic skin systems require stretchable conductors and low&#8208;temperature integration of external components, which remains challenging for traditional metal films. Herein, a bioinspired design concept is reported to endow metal films with 200% stretchability as well as room&#8208;temperature integration capability with diverse components. It is revealed that by controllable implantation of defects, distinctive venation&#8208;mimicking cracking modes can be induced in strained metal films, leading to profound stretchability regulation. An intriguing exponential&#8208;to&#8208;linear transition of the film electromechanical performance is observed, which is elucidated by a unified model covering the essence of all modes. Combined with room&#8208;temperature integration capability, an integrated electronic skin is constructed with metal films serving as stretchable electrodes, diverse sensors, and &#8220;tapes&#8221; to attach subcomponents, showing prospects in helping disabled people. This one&#8208;step, defect implantation strategy is applicable to common metals without special substrate treatments, which enables fascinating ultrastretchable metal film conductors with low&#8208;temperature integration capability to spark more sophisticated flexible electronic systems.

         <title>Electrolyte for High&#8208;Energy&#8208; and Power&#8208;Density Zinc Batteries and Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dibetaine zinc(II) complex with additional weakly coordinating acetonitrile ligands proves to be an excellent electrolyte for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;based rechargeable batteries and ion capacitors. It efficiently prevents dendrite formation on the electrode and allows almost degradation&#8208;free, efficient long&#8208;term cycling at high voltage, and very high currents.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, limited coulombic efficiency (CE), and the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes restrict the commercialization of zinc batteries and capacitors. These issues are resolved by a new electrolyte, based on the zinc(II)&#8211;betaine complex [Zn(bet)2][NTf2]2. Solutions in acetonitrile (AN) avoid dendrite formation. A Zn||Zn cell operates stably over 10 110 h (5055 cycles) at 0.2 mA cm&#8722;2 or 110 h at 50 mA cm&#8722;2, and has an area capacity of 113 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 80% depth of discharge. A zinc&#8211;graphite battery performs at 2.6 V with a midpoint discharge&#8208;voltage of 2.4 V. The capacity&#8208;retention at 3 A g&#8722;1 (150 C) is 97% after 1000 cycles and 68% after 10&#160;000 cycles. The charge/discharge time is about 24 s at 3.0 A g&#8722;1 with an energy density of 49 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 6864 W kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode. A zinc||activated&#8208;carbon ion&#8208;capacitor (coin cell) exhibits an operating&#8208;voltage window of 2.5 V, an energy density of 96 Wh kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 610 W kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. At 12 A g&#8722;1, 36 Wh kg&#8722;1, and 13&#160;600 W kg&#8722;1 are achieved with 90% capacity&#8208;retention and an average CE of 96% over 10&#160;000 cycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical methods and vibrational spectroscopy reveal [Zn(bet)2(AN)2]2+ as the dominant complex in the electrolyte.

         <title>Gold Nanobipyramid&#8208;Mediated Apoptotic Camouflage of Adipocytes for Obesity Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages, an immunotherapy for obesity treatment is developed for the first time to activate macrophages resident in adipose tissue to clear adipocytes by camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic features by gold nanobipyramids, which not only induce&#160;significant weight loss but also prevent weight regain, holding great potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Obesity treatment is a global public health challenge due to inadequate weight loss and weight regain even after endeavors with multimodal treatments. Considering the abundance of resident macrophages in adipose tissues, precise regulation of the interactions between macrophages and adipocytes may provide chances for immunotherapy of obesity. Herein, inspired by the phagocytosis of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells in homeostasis, an immunotherapy strategy for obesity treatment is proposed for the first time through apoptotic camouflage of adipocytes by PAAu BPs to activate macrophages for clearance, where PAAu BPs are gold nanobipyramids engineered with adipose&#8208;targeting and apoptotic cell&#8208;mimicking functions. During clearance, the&#160;macrophage is switched from pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 to anti&#8208;inflammatory M2, remarkably modulating the immune microenvironment of adipose tissues to prevent weight regain. After inguinal injection with PAAu BPs, the body weights of obese mice are effectively decreased by 24.4% and can be decreased by 33.3% when combined with photothermal lipolysis, and little weight regain is associated with these treatments. This study demonstrates that the strategy of camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic features holds great potential for obesity immunotherapy.

         <title>Defect Engineering Stabilized AgSbTe2 with High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) generators enable the direct and reversible conversion between heat and electricity, providing applications in both refrigeration and power generation. The grand challenge in the field is related to the low conversion efficiency of TE devices. In the last decade, several TE materials with relatively high figures of merit (zT) have been reported in low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature regimes. However, there is an urgent demand for high&#8208;performance TE materials working in the mid&#8208;temperature range (400&#8208;700 K). Herein, p&#8208;type AgSbTe2 materials stabilized with S and Se co&#8208;doping are demonstrated to exhibit an outstanding maximum figure of merit (zTmax) of 2.3 at 673 K and an average figure of merit (zTave) of 1.59 over the wide temperature range of 300 &#8211; 673 K. This exceptional performance arises from an enhanced carrier density resulting from a higher concentration of silver vacancies, a vastly improved Seebeck coefficient enabled by the flattening of the valence band maximum and the inhibited formation of n&#8208;type Ag2Te, and a highly improved stability beyond 673 K. The optimized material is used to fabricate a single&#8208;leg device with efficiencies of up to 13.3% and an unicouple TE device reaching energy conversion efficiencies up to 12.3% at a temperature difference of 370 K. These results highlight an effective strategy to engineer high&#8208;performance TE material for cost&#8208;effective waste heat recovery in the mid&#8208;temperature range.

         <title>Membrane&#8208;fusion&#8208;mediated Multiplex Engineering of Tumor Cell Surface Glycans for Enhanced NK Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but were immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;surface glycans. To reverse this glycan&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK&#8208;inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK&#8208;activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, we design a core&#8208;shell membrane&#8208;fusogenic liposome (MFL) to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK&#8208;activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane&#8208;fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;triggered&#8208;degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase&#8208;inhibitor&#8208;loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK&#8208;activating&#8208;glycan&#8208;modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially&#8208;differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK&#8208;activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid&#8208;caused immunosuppression of tumor surface was reprogrammed to be LeX&#8208;induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural killer (NK) cell therapies show potential for tumor treatment but were immunologically resisted by the overexpressed immunosuppressing tumor-cell-surface glycans. To reverse this glycan-mediated immunosuppression, the surface NK-inhibitory glycan expressions need to be downregulated and NK-activating glycan levels should be elevated synchronously with optimal efficiency. Here, we design a core-shell membrane-fusogenic liposome (MFL) to simultaneously achieve the physical modification of NK-activating glycans and biological inhibition of immunosuppressing glycans on the tumor cell surface via a membrane-fusion manner. Loaded into a tumor-microenvironment-triggered-degradable thermosensitive hydrogel, MFLs could be conveniently injected and controllably released into local tumor. Through fusion with tumor cell membrane, the released MFLs could simultaneously deliver sialyltransferase-inhibitor-loaded core into cytoplasm, and anchor NK-activating-glycan-modified shell onto tumor surface. This spatially-differential distribution of core and shell in one cell ensures the effective inhibition of intracellular sialyltransferase to downregulate immunosuppressing sialic acid, and direct presentation of NK-activating Lewis X trisaccharide (LeX) on tumor surface simultaneously. Consequentially, the sialic acid-caused immunosuppression of tumor surface was reprogrammed to be LeX-induced NK activation, resulting in sensitive susceptibility to NK-cell-mediated recognition and lysis for improved tumor elimination. This MFL provides a novel platform for multiplex cell engineering and personalized regulation of intercellular interactions for enhanced cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conformal Volumetric Grayscale Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conformal artificial electromagnetic media that feature tailorable responses as a function of incidence wavelength and angle represent universal components for optical engineering. We introduce conformal grayscale metamaterials as a new class of volumetric electromagnetic media capable of supporting highly multiplexed responses and arbitrary, curvilinear form factors. Subwavelength&#8208;scale voxels based on irregular shapes are designed to accommodate a continuum of dielectric values, enabling the freeform design process to reliably converge to exceptionally high Figure of Merits for a given multi&#8208;objective design problem. Through additive manufacturing of ceramic&#8208;polymer composites, we experimentally fabricate microwave metamaterials, designed for the radio frequency range of 8&#8211;12&#160;GHz, and demonstrate devices with extreme dispersion profiles, an airfoil&#8208;shaped beam steering device, and a broadband, broad angle conformal carpet cloak. We anticipate that conformal volumetric metamaterials will lead to new classes of compact and multi&#8208;functional imaging, sensing, and communications systems.

         <title>Dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Approaches capable of simultaneously treating cancer and preventing susceptible patients from lethal infections, such as coronavirus disease 2019, are highly desirable but have proven to be difficult. Here, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface is reported to elicit dual anticancer and antiviral immunity. A combination of checkpoint blocking antibody and virus&#8208;specific antigen is covalently conjugated to polydopamine nanoparticles, which can be anchored onto bacterial surface, by a one&#8208;step in&#8208;situ polymerization of dopamine under a cell&#8208;friendly condition. By virtue of the ability to colonize and penetrate deep tumor tissue, dressed bacteria enable sustained release and expanded exposure of carried immunoactivators to stimulate immune cells. In addition to a carrier role, bacteria are able to further provoke innate immunity due to native immunogenicity of the pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns. Immunization with dressed bacteria promote the maturation and activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells, which induces robust humoral and cellular immune responses in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. As evidenced by efficient production of viral antigen&#8208;specific immunoglobulin G antibody in serum and significantly suppressed tumor growth in different models, dressing bacteria with a hybrid immunoactive nanosurface paves an avenue to prepare next&#8208;generation therapeutics for synergistic treatment and prevention.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations and neuromorphology. Here we report a brand new pseudocapacitor diode having both high charge storage (50.2 C g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, we demonstrate an application of the integrated device in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thoughts for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is now well established that hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem with annual losses in billions of dollars. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology offers security solutions, these are mostly inadequate, inefficient, often inconclusive, and resource extensive in time, energy, and cost, offering tremendous scope for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. Finally, the demise of dimension scaling of silicon transistors and the computing bottleneck enforced by von&#8208;Neumann architecture aggravate the security challenges. In recent years, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, we summarize 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generators (TRNGs), watermarking, anti&#8208;counterfeits, physically unclonable functions (PUFs), and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) along with the discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, we also examine the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D integrated circuits to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry.

         <title>Recent Advances in the Use of Covalent Organic Frameworks as Heterogeneous Photocatalysts in Organic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic photochemistry developed intensely in the 1980s in which the nature of excited electronic states and the energy and electron transfer processes were thoroughly studied and finally well&#8208;understood. This knowledge from molecular organic photochemistry can be transferred to the design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as active visible light photocatalyts. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) constitute a new class of crystalline porous materials with substantial application potentials. Featured with outstanding structural tunability, large porosity, high surface area, excellent stability and unique photoelectronic properties, COFs have been studied as potential candidates in various research areas (e.g., photocatalysis). This review was aimed to provide state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art insights into the design of COF photocatalysts (pristine, functionalized, and hybrid COFs) for organic transformations. The catalytic reaction mechanism of COF&#8208;based photocatalysts and the influence of dimensionality and crystallinity on heterogenous photocatalysis performance was also discussed, followed by perspectives and prospects on the main challenges and opportunities in future research of COFs and COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Reprocessable and Chemically Recyclable Hard Vitrimers Based on Liquid&#8208;Crystalline Epoxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.64 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re&#8208;cured. Surprisingly, the recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re&#8208;hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8764;60&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid increase in demand for recyclable and reusable thermosets has necessitated the development of materials with chemical structures that exhibit these features. Thus, functional mesogenic epoxide monomers bearing both ester and imine groups that can be vitrimerized and recycled are reported herein. The compounds show mesophase characteristics at 100&#8211;200&#176;C and can be converted into hard epoxides by a common curing reaction. The obtained hard epoxides have high isotropic thermal conductivity (&#8764;0.64 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which is derived from their highly ordered microstructures. The cured products can be easily reprocessed through imine metathesis and transesterification, and decomposed products can be obtained through imine hydrolysis under acidic or basic conditions and subsequently be re-cured. Surprisingly, the recycled materials can be repeatedly reprocessed or chemically decomposed. The reprocessed materials retain the properties of their pristine counterparts, and the recycled products preserve the advantages of the hard thermosets without alteration to any of their unique properties. A dehydration reaction occurs between the residual hydroxyl groups during the re-hardening, which dramatically increases the glass transition temperature by &#8764;60&#176;C. These reprocessable and recyclable vitrimers demonstrate the effectiveness and environmental friendliness of the molecular design strategy reported herein.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Efficient Inherent Linearly Polarized Electroluminescence From Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic single crystals (SCs) with an inherent in&#8208;plane anisotropic nature enable direct linearly polarized light emission without the need for spatially separated polarizer and complex optical structures. However, the device performance is severely restricted by the starvation of appropriate SC emitters and the difficulty in the construction of efficient SC electroluminescence (EL) devices, leading to a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of usually smaller than 1.5%. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LP&#8208;LEDs) by exploiting 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) SCs as intrinsically polarized emitters. The LP&#8208;LEDs exhibit a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced maximum EQE of 3.38%, which approaches the theoretical limit for the DPA SC&#8208;based EL device and is the highest among organic SC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes reported thus far. More importantly, a high degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74 is achieved for the intrinsically polarized EL emission of the DPA SC&#8208;based LP&#8208;LEDs. By leveraging the highly efficient LP&#8208;LED, we demonstrate for the first time an inter&#8208;chip polarized optical communication system consisting of organic SCs. This work creates a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast new library of small&#8208;molecule organic SCs for LP&#8208;LEDs and carries broad implications for polarized optics and relevant optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Small-molecule organic single crystals (SCs) with an inherent in-plane anisotropic nature enable direct linearly polarized light emission without the need for spatially separated polarizer and complex optical structures. However, the device performance is severely restricted by the starvation of appropriate SC emitters and the difficulty in the construction of efficient SC electroluminescence (EL) devices, leading to a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of usually smaller than 1.5%. Here, we demonstrate highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light-emitting diodes (LP-LEDs) by exploiting 2,6-diphenylanthracene (DPA) SCs as intrinsically polarized emitters. The LP-LEDs exhibit a 2.5-fold enhanced maximum EQE of 3.38%, which approaches the theoretical limit for the DPA SC-based EL device and is the highest among organic SC-based light-emitting diodes reported thus far.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle&#8208;Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, laggard transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage always lead to severe injuries or even death. Herein, we develop an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST). It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). We have demonstrated the implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared Responsive J&#8208;Aggregates of Fused Quinoidal Tetracyanoindacenodithiophene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Narrowband photoresponsive molecules are highly coveted in high&#8208;resolution imaging, sensing and monochromatic photodetection, especially those extending into the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral range. Here we report a new class of J&#8208;aggregating materials based on quinoidal indacenodithiophenes (IDT) which exhibit an ultra&#8208;narrowband (full width half maxima of 22&#160;nm) NIR absorption peak centered at 770&#160;nm. The spectral width is readily tuned by the length of the solubilising alkyl group, with longer chains resulting in significant spectral narrowing. The J&#8208;aggregate behaviour is confirmed by a combination of excited state lifetime measurements and single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements. Their utility as electron transporting materials is demonstrated in both transistor and phototransistor devices, with the latter demonstrating good response at NIR wavelengths (780&#160;nm) over a range of intensities.

         <title>Well&#8208;defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;performance Tin&#8208;based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4 and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct are isolated and well&#8208;characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59% and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>

Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical sized bone defects cannot heal on its own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remain largely unknown. Here we report mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#956;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses were used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. We demonstrate MSCM coating promotes M&#966; polarization towards regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. MSCM primed with pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines enhances regenerative immune response and promotes MSC osteogenesis. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, primed MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

A retinomorphic vision sensor based on bilayer platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is proposed. The sensor mimics the chromatic adaptation of the human retina. The photocontrolled adsorption and desorption of O2 molecules on the PtSe2 surface lead to wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoconductivity. Spontaneous chromatic adaptation based on this device provides a basis for developing artificial vision perception systems with simplified circuitry.








Abstract
Chromatic adaptation refers to the sensing and preprocessing of the spectral composition of incident light on the retina, and it is important for color&#8208;image recognition. It is challenging to apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images via the same physical process using the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology because of redundant data detection, complicated signal conversion processes, and the requirement for additional memory modules. Inspired by the highly efficient chromatic adaptation of the human retina, a 2D oxygen&#8208;mediated platinum diselenide (PtSe2) device is presented to simultaneously apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images. The device exhibits a wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoresponse and the linear pulse&#8208;number dependence of photoconductivity, which is dominated by the photon&#8208;mediated physical adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules on bilayer PtSe2. The proposed retinomorphic device shows superior image classification accuracy (over 90%) compared to an independent pseudocolor channel (less than 75%). Hence, it is promising for developing artificial vision perception systems with reduced architectural complexity.

         <title>Dynamic Assembly of Viscoelastic Networks by Aqueous Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8211;Solid Phase Separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic assembly of viscoelastic networks is achieved for the first time by aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2). The networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated droplets as templates, followed by liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the continuous phase.








Abstract
Living cells comprise diverse subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal networks, which can regulate essential cellular activities through dynamic assembly and synergistic interactions with biomolecular condensates. Despite extensive efforts, reproducing viscoelastic networks for modulating biomolecular condensates in synthetic systems remains challenging. Here, a new aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) is proposed, which consists of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and dextran (DEX), to construct viscoelastic networks capable of being assembled and dissociated dynamically to regulate the self&#8208;assembly of condensates on&#8208;demand. Viscoelastic networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated DEX droplets as templates and the following liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the PNIPAM&#8208;rich phase. The resulting networks can dissolve liquid fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates within 5 min. This work demonstrates rich phase&#8208;separation behaviors in a single ATPS through incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers. The concept can potentially be applied to other macromolecules through other stimuli to develop materials with rich phase behaviors and hierarchical structures.

         <title>Accelerating Electron&#8208;Transfer Dynamics by TiO2&#8208;Immobilized Reversible Single&#8208;Atom Copper for Enhanced Artificial Photosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating electron&#8208;transfer dynamics by TiO2&#8208;immobilized reversible single&#8208;atom copper is proposed for enhancing artificial urea photosynthesis using N2 and CO2 in pure H2O. The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the accelerated electron&#8208;transfer dynamics can be attributed to the reversibility of single&#8208;atom Cu for ensuring multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demand and supply of urea photosynthesis, thereby yielding as high as 432.12&#160;&#181;g gcat.&#8722;1 of urea.








Abstract
Photocatalysis as a sustainable technology is expected to provide a novel sight for the green synthesis of urea directly using N2, CO2, and H2O under mild conditions. However, the fundamental issue of inefficient electron transfer in photocatalysis strongly hinders its feasibility, especially for the above multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding urea synthesis. Herein, an effective strategy of accelerating electron&#8208;transfer dynamics is reported by TiO2&#8208;immobilized reversible single&#8208;atom copper (denoted as Cu SA&#8208;TiO2) to enhance the performance for photosynthesis of urea from N2, CO2, and H2O. As revealed by a series of quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterizations (e.g., electron paramagnetic resonance, and wavelength&#8208;resolved and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies), the expedited dynamics behaviors originating from reversible single&#8208;atom copper in as&#8208;designed Cu SA&#8208;TiO2 (electron extraction rate: over 30 times faster than the reference photocatalysts) allow the assurance of abundant and continual photogenerated electrons for multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding co&#8208;photoactivation of N2 and CO2, resulting in considerable rates of urea production. The strategy above for improving the photoelectron&#8208;extraction ability of photocatalysts will offer a high&#8208;efficiency and promising route for artificial urea photosynthesis and other multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Activating Organic Phosphorescence via Heavy Metal&#8211;&#960; Interaction Induced Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization strategy is developed to enable efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the organic dye with a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield of 25.1 &#177; 1%. This strategy to brighten the triplet state of organic chromophores may be quite general and open up a new avenue for designing innovative phosphorescent materials.








Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing clusters, nanocrystals, and other semiconductors can sensitize the triplet states of their surface&#8208;bonded chromophores, but the energy loss, such as nonradiative deactivation, often prevents the synergistic light emission in their solid&#8208;state coassemblies. Cocrystallization allows new combinations of molecules with complementary properties for achieving functionalities not available in single components. Here, the cocrystal formation that employs platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) as a triplet sensitizer and electron&#8208;deficient 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene&#160;diimides (NDIs) as organic phosphors is reported. The hybrid cocrystals exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the low&#8208;lying, long&#8208;lived triplet state of NDIs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) exceeding 25% and a phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;Ph) of 156 &#181;s. This remarkable PL property benefits from the noncovalent electronic and spin&#8211;orbital coupling between the constituents.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Polarization Manipulation of Ferroelectricity in Twisted hBN</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectricity is generated in twisted hBN flakes, which are used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction. Spatially resolved investigation by a conductive atomic force microscope tip reveals the unconventional ferroelectricity in this system, including lattice&#8208;slide&#8208;induced domain change, an unusual relationship between the tunneling resistance and polarization, and highly spatially dependent ferroelectric hysteresis.








Abstract
Robust room&#8208;temperature interfacial ferroelectricity has been formed in the 2D&#160;limit by simply twisting two atomic layers of non&#8208;ferroelectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). A thorough understanding of this newly discovered ferroelectric system is required. Here, twisted hBN is used as a tunneling junction and it is studied at the nanometer scale using conductive atomic force microscopy. Three properties unique to this system are discovered. First, the polarization dependence of the tunneling resistance contrasts with the conventional theory. Second, the ferroelectric domains can be controlled using mechanical stress, highlighting the original meaning of the emergent &#8220;slidetronics&#8221;. Third, ferroelectric hysteresis is highly spatially dependent. The hysteresis is symmetric at the domain walls. A few nanometers away, the hysteresis shifts completely to the positive or negative side, depending on the original polarization. These findings reveal the unconventional ferroelectricity in this 2D system.

Third, ferroelectric hysteresis is highly spatially dependent. The hysteresis is symmetric at the domain walls. A few nanometers away, the hysteresis shifts completely to the positive or negative side, depending on the original polarization. These findings reveal the unconventional ferroelectricity in this 2D system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional Coating from Amyloid Superwetting Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid fibrils are used as scaffolds for multifunctional films for different applications, including oil/water separation, antifouling, and antifogging materials. Enzyme immobilization on amyloid&#8208;modified surfaces further enables biocatalytic oxidation and degradation of target compounds, extending use to bio&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films are extended from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. It is shown that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non&#8208;woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass, and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibril coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as shown in the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) oxidation and Reactive Black 5 (RB5)&#160;degradation by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio&#8208;based applications and functionalities.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;Hijacking Nanoparticles Spatiotemporally Directing Endogenous Ferroptosis for Synergistic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) is fabricated by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which can induce ferroptosis through activation of endogenous iron. This strategy highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8211;photodynamic antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Existing ferroptosis as an iron&#8208;dependent form of regulated cell death primarily relies on importing exogenous iron. However, the excessive employment of toxic materials may cause potential adverse effects on human health. Herein, a ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) is fabricated, by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) for endogenous ferroptosis without introducing Fenton&#8208;reactive metals. Once internalized, the designed Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15 NPs can specifically accumulate around ferritin. With laser irradiation, the activated Ce6 in nanoparticles potently generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) surrounding ferritin. Abundant ROS not only helps&#160;to destroy the iron storage protein and activate endogenous ferroptosis but also directly kill tumor cells. In turn, the released iron partially interacts with intracellular excess H2O2 to produce O2, thereby enhancing photodynamic therapy and further amplifying oxidative stress. Overall, this work highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8211;photodynamic antitumor therapy.

         <title>Desolvation Synergy of Multiple H/Li&#8208;Bonds on an Iron&#8208;Dextran&#8208;Based Catalyst Stimulates Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient VC@INFeD catalyst is developed for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, accomplishing fast de&#8208;solvation and enrichment of high&#8208;concentration lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by multiple H/Li&#8208;bonds and resolving subsequent sulfur transformations through cascade catalytic sites where INFeD and VC promote the conversions of long&#8208;chain and short&#8208;chain LiPSs, respectively, which substantially reduce energy barriers and eliminate LiPS shuttling effects.








Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8211;sulfur battery catalysts are still facing substantial challenges in solving sulfur redox reactions, which involve multistep electron transfer and multiphase transformations. Here, inspired by the combination of iron dextran (INFeD) and ascorbic acid (VC) as a blood tonic for the treatment of anemia, a highly efficient VC@INFeD catalyst is developed in the sulfur cathode, accomplishing the desolvation and enrichment of high&#8208;concentration solvated lithium polysulfides at the cathode/electrolyte interface with the assistance of multiple H/Li&#8208;bonds and resolving subsequent sulfur transformations through gradient catalysis sites where the INFeD promotes long&#8208;chain lithium polysulfide conversions and VC accelerates short&#8208;chain lithium polysulfide conversions. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that the VC@INFeD can substantially reduce the energy barrier of each sulfur redox step, inhibit shuttle effects, and endow the lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with high sulfur utilization and superior cycling stability even under a high sulfur loading (5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte (electrolyte/sulfur ratio, &#8776;7&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1) condition.

         <title>Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron with Excitatory&#8211;Inhibitory Spatiotemporal Dynamics Applied for Neuronal Oscillations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;transistor neuron with excitatory&#8211;inhibitory spatiotemporal dynamics is constructed by integrating a threshold switch with a 2D MoS2&#160;channel, which exhibits bio&#8208;realistic dynamics to achieve essential neuronal functions such as leaky integration, threshold&#8208;driven fire, inhibition, and self&#8208;recovery. The device can be adopted to emulate high&#8208;dimensional population code&#8212;neuronal oscillations and support information integration and synchronization.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing systems with the potential to drive the next wave of artificial intelligence demand a spectrum of critical components beyond simple characteristics. An emerging research trend is to achieve advanced functions with ultracompact neuromorphic devices. In this work, a single&#8208;transistor neuron is demonstrated that implements excitatory&#8211;inhibitory (E&#8211;I) spatiotemporal integration and a series of essential neuron behaviors. Neuronal oscillations, the fundamental mode of neuronal communication, that construct high&#8208;dimensional population code to achieve efficient computing in the brain, can also be demonstrated by the neuron transistors. The highly scalable E&#8211;I neuron can be the basic building block for implementing core neuronal circuit motifs and large&#8208;scale architectural plans to replicate energy&#8208;efficient neural computations, forming the foundation of future integrated neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Synergistic Reinforcing of Immunogenic Cell Death and Transforming Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Via a Multifunctional Cascade Bioreactor for Optimizing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CaO2@CuS&#8211;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite is developed to achieve the two&#8208;way enhancement of Ca2+ overload and photodynamic therapy related immunogenic cell death, by disrupting the mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity and allaying hypoxia. Moreover, the subsequently escaped oxidatively damaged mitochondrial DNA is able to activate M1 polarization of tumor associated macrophages. Combining CCMH with aPD&#8208;L1 significantly improves immunotherapy efficacy.

Immunogenic cell death (ICD) has aroused widespread attention because it can reconstruct a tumor microenvironment and activate antitumor immunity. This study proposes a two&#8208;way enhancement of ICD based on a CaO2@CuS&#8211;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite to overcome the insufficient damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of conventional ICD&#8208;inducers. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (1064&#160;nm) of CuS nanoparticles generates 1O2 through photodynamic therapy (PDT) to trigger ICD, and it also damages the Ca2+ buffer function of mitochondria. Additionally, CaO2 nanoparticles react with H2O to produce a large amount of O2 and Ca2+, which respectively lead to enhanced PDT and Ca2+ overload during mitochondrial damage, thereby triggering a robust ICD activation. Moreover, oxidative&#8208;damaged mitochondrial DNA, induced by PDT and released from tumor cells, reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by transforming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to the M1 subphenotype. This study shows that CCMH with NIR&#8208;II irradiation can elicit adequate DAMPs and an active tumor&#8208;immune microenvironment for both 4T1 and CT26 tumor models. Combining this method with an immune checkpoint blockade can realize an improved immunotherapy efficacy and long&#8208;term protection effect for body.

&lt;p&gt;A CaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@CuS&#8211;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite is developed to achieve the two-way enhancement of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; overload and photodynamic therapy related immunogenic cell death, by disrupting the mitochondrial Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering capacity and allaying hypoxia. Moreover, the subsequently escaped oxidatively damaged mitochondrial DNA is able to activate M1 polarization of tumor associated macrophages. Combining CCMH with aPD-L1 significantly improves immunotherapy efficacy.

         <title>Switchable Ion Current Saturation Regimes Enabled via Heterostructured Nanofluidic Devices Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidic devices displaying switchable ion current saturation regimes can be realized by integration of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into asymmetric nanochannels. These unusual transport properties stem from the interplay between the permselectivity and heterostructure of the MOF&#8208;modified nanochannels. These devices can operate over a wide range of saline concentrations and their properties can be reversibly modulated by changing the pH.








Abstract
The use of track&#8208;etched membranes allows further fine&#8208;tuning of transport regimes and thus enables their use in (bio)sensing and energy&#8208;harvesting applications, among others. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been combined with such membranes to further increase their potential. Herein, the creation of a single track&#8208;etched nanochannel modified with the UiO&#8208;66 MOF is proposed. By the interfacial growth method, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined synthesis fills the nanochannel completely and smoothly, yet its constructional porosity renders a heterostructure along the axial coordinate of the channel. The MOF heterostructure confers notorious changes in the transport regime of the nanofluidic device. In particular, the tortuosity provided by the micro&#8208; and mesostructure of UiO&#8208;66 added to its charged state leads to iontronic outputs characterized by an asymmetric ion current saturation for transmembrane voltages exceeding 0.3&#160;V. Remarkably, this behavior can be easily and reversibly modulated by changing the pH of the media and it can also be maintained for a wide range of KCl concentrations. In addition, it is found that the modified&#8208;nanochannel functionality cannot be explained by considering just the intrinsic microporosity of UiO&#8208;66, but rather the constructional porosity that arises during the MOF growth process plays a central and dominant role.

         <title>In Situ Nucleation&#8208;Decoupled and Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of &#197;&#8208;Scale Pores in Graphene Via Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosized epoxy clusters form on graphene surface upon exposure to ozone near room temperature. When sufficient energy is supplied, clusters gasify forming nanopores. The energy barrier is measured for cluster formation as 0.42&#160;eV and for cluster gasification in the pore as 1.3&#160;eV. The approach allows decoupling of pore nucleation (pore density) and expansion (pore size).








Abstract
Generating pores in graphene by decoupled nucleation and expansion is desired to achieve a fine control over the porosity, and is desired to advance several applications. Herein, epoxidation is introduced, which is the formation of nanosized epoxy clusters on the graphitic lattice as nucleation sites without forming pores. In&#160;situ gasification of clusters inside a transmission electron microscope shows that pores are generated precisely at the site of the clusters by surpassing an energy barrier of 1.3&#160;eV. Binding energy predictions using ab initio calculations combined with the cluster nucleation theory reveal the structure of the epoxy clusters and indicate that the critical cluster is an epoxy dimer. Finally, it is shown that the cluster gasification can be manipulated to form &#197;&#8208;scale pores which then effectively sieve gas molecules based on their size. This decoupled cluster nucleation and pore formation will likely pave the way for an independent control of pore size and density.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;Suspended Graphene Grown on a Si Wafer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a precisely designed interface&#8208;decoupling strategy, quasi&#8208;suspended graphene can be grown directly on a 4 inch Si wafer. The obtained Gr/Si sample enables transfer&#8208;free fabrication of graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor devices with high electronic performance and a carrier mobility up to 15&#8239;000 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The direct growth of graphene affording wafer&#8208;scale uniformity on insulators is paramount to electronic and optoelectronic applications; however, it remains a challenge to date, because it entails an entirely different growth mode than that over metals. Herein, the metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free growth of quasi&#8208;suspended graphene on a Si wafer is demonstrated using an interface&#8208;decoupling chemical vapor deposition strategy. The employment of lower&#8208;than&#8208;conventional H2 dosage and concurrent introduction of methanol during growth can effectively weaken the interaction between the synthesized graphene and the underlying substrate. The growth mode can be thus fine&#8208;tuned, producing a predominantly monolayer graphene film with wafer&#8208;level homogeneity. Graphene thus grown on a 4 inch Si wafer enables the transfer&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays that exhibit almost no shift in the charge neutral point, indicating a quasi&#8208;suspended feature of the graphene. Moreover, a carrier mobility up to 15 000 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1 can be attained. This study is anticipated to offer meaningful insights into the synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality graphene on dielectrics for practical graphene devices.

         <title>N &#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) Acetamide Additive Enables Phase&#8208;Pure and Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to obtain phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The additive reduces the potential barrier in the phase transition process, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and phase&#8208;pure&#160;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. The resultant self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits superior performance.








Abstract
Formamidinium&#8211;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite is considered as one of the most promising perovskite materials for high&#8208;performance photodetectors because of its narrow bandgap and superior thermal stability. Nevertheless, to realize efficient carrier transport and highly performing photodetectors, it imposes the requirement of fabricating &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with pure phase, preferred crystal orientation, large grain size, and passivated interface, which still remains challenging. Here, a facile strategy based on additive engineering to obtain pure&#8208;phase FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The formation of chemical bond and hydrogen bond between N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide and perovskite reduces the potential barrier in the phase&#8208;transition process from an intermediate yellow phase to a final black phase, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits a maximum responsivity of 0.48 A W&#8722;1 at 700&#160;nm with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of 95% at 440&#160;nm. Moreover, the optimized device remains 83% of the initial performance after 576&#160;h storage at ambient condition.

     alt="N -(2-aminoethyl) Acetamide Additive Enables Phase-Pure and Stable &#945;-FAPbI3 for Efficient Self-Powered Photodetectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A facile strategy to obtain phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films by introducing N-(2-aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The additive reduces the potential barrier in the phase transition process, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high-quality and phase-pure&#160;&#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. The resultant self-powered photodetector based on the as-fabricated FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film exhibits superior performance.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Formamidinium&#8211;lead triiodide (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) perovskite is considered as one of the most promising perovskite materials for high-performance photodetectors because of its narrow bandgap and superior thermal stability. Nevertheless, to realize efficient carrier transport and highly performing photodetectors, it imposes the requirement of fabricating &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with pure phase, preferred crystal orientation, large grain size, and passivated interface, which still remains challenging. Here, a facile strategy based on additive engineering to obtain pure-phase FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite films by introducing &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The formation of chemical bond and hydrogen bond between &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(2-aminoethyl) acetamide and perovskite reduces the potential barrier in the phase-transition process from an intermediate yellow phase to a final black phase, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high-quality and phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite. A self-powered photodetector based on the as-fabricated FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film exhibits a maximum responsivity of 0.48 A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 700&#160;nm with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of 95% at 440&#160;nm. Moreover, the optimized device remains 83% of the initial performance after 576&#160;h storage at ambient condition. This work provides a simple and feasible scheme for the preparation of high-quality phase-pure &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite and associated devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Microneedle Patches with Ultrafast Dissolution and Rapid&#8208;Onset Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches composed of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives demonstrate strong and tough mechanical properties by virtue of multiple supramolecular interactions, surpassing that of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMN patches. CD DMN can load hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and dissolve extremely fast to achieve a rapid onset of its payloads, which is unachievable with conventional polymeric DMN patches.








Abstract
Dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches are emerging as a minimally invasive and efficient transdermal drug delivery platform. Generally, noncrystalline, water&#8208;soluble, and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers are employed in DMNs because their sufficient intermolecular interactions can endow the DMNs with necessary mechanical strength and toughness. However, high viscosity and heavy chain entanglement of polymer solutions greatly hinder processing and dissolution of polymeric DMNs. Here, a strong and tough supramolecular DMN patch made of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives is described. Due to the synergy of multiple supramolecular interactions, the CD DMN patch exhibits robust mechanical strength outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMNs. The CD DMN displays ultrafast dissolution (&lt;30 s) in skin models by virtue of the dynamic and weak noncovalent bonds, which also enables the CD DMN and its payloads to diffuse rapidly into the deep skin layer. Moreover, the unique supramolecular structure of CD allows the CD DMNs to load not only hydrophilic drugs (e.g., rhodamine B as a model) but also hydrophobic model drugs (e.g., ibuprofen). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, CD DMNs loading ibuprofen show a rapid onset of therapeutic action in a xylene&#8208;induced acute inflammation model in mice. This work opens a new avenue for the development of mechanically robust supramolecular DMNs and broadens the applications of supramolecular materials.

         <title>A Monolithic Graphene&#8208;Functionalized Microlaser for Multispecies Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of 2D materials and optical microcavities offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques. In this work, graphene&#8208;enabled splitting modes in a monolithic microsphere laser are used to obtain multispecies gas detection (CO2, NH3, NO2,&#160;and H2O) with extremely high sensitivity down to individual molecules.








Abstract
Optical&#8208;microcavity&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter interaction offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques, spurring applications in the detection of biochemical targets ranging from cells, nanoparticles, and large molecules. However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, a functionalized microlaser sensor is realized by depositing graphene in an erbium&#8208;doped over&#8208;modal microsphere. By using a 980&#160;nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co&#8208;generated in a single device. The interference between these splitting mode lasers produce beat notes in the electrical domain (0.2&#8211;1.1&#160;MHz) with sub&#8208;kHz accuracy, thanks to the graphene&#8208;induced intracavity backward scattering. This allows for lab&#8208;free multispecies gas identification from a mixture, and ultrasensitive gas detection down to individual molecule.

         <title>Interface Reconstruction from Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Structures Impacts Stability in Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky cations are widely used in the halide perovskite field to reduce nonradiative recombination at interfaces. In this work, a critical perspective on the use of these organohalide salts is provided. It is demonstrated that some of these capping layers are unstable and prolonged annealing is proposed&#160;as a critical way to drive the selection between different bulky cations for improved stability.








Abstract
The impact of the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;modified interfaces on halide perovskite solar cell stability is underexplored. In this work, the thermal instability of the bulky&#8208;cation interface layers used in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells is demonstrated. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal significant changes in the chemical composition and structure at the surface of these films that occur under thermal stress. The changes impact charge&#8208;carrier dynamics and device operation, as shown in transient photoluminescence, excitation correlation spectroscopy, and solar cells. The type of cation used for surface treatment affects the extent of these changes, where long carbon chains provide more stable interfaces. These results highlight that prolonged annealing of the treated interfaces is critical to enable reliable reporting of performances and to drive the selection of different bulky cations.

         <title>Bioinspired Chiral Template Guided Mineralization for Biophotonic Structural Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired artificial molting strategy based on self&#8208;assembly of cellulose nanocrystals and subsequent mineralization is developed to produce biomimetic photonic structural composites. These biomimetic composites exhibit tunable mechanics from &#8220;strong and flexible&#8221; to &#8220;stiff and hard,&#8221; as well as tunable chiral structural color and water&#8208;triggered switchable photonics that are absent in most artificial mineralized materials.








Abstract
Nature provides numerous biomineral design inspirations for constructing structural materials with desired functionalities. However, large&#8208;scale production of damage&#8208;tolerant Bouligand structural materials with biologically comparable photonics remains a longstanding challenge. Here, an efficient and scalable artificial molting strategy, based on self&#8208;assembly of cellulose nanocrystals and subsequent mineralization of amorphous calcium carbonate, is developed to produce biomimetic materials with an exceptional combination of mechanical and photonic properties that are usually mutually exclusive in synthetic materials. These biomimetic composites exhibit tunable mechanics from &#8220;strong and flexible&#8221;, which&#160;exceeds the benchmark of natural chiral materials, to &#8220;stiff and hard&#8221;, which is comparable to natural and synthetic counterparts. Especially, the biomimetic composites possess ultrahigh stiffness of 2&#160;GPa in their fully water&#8208;swollen state&#8212;a value well beyond hydrated crab exoskeleton, cartilage, tendon, and stiffest synthetic hydrogels, combined with exceptional strength and resilience. Additionally, these composites are distinguished by the tunable chiral structural color and water&#8208;triggered switchable photonics that are absent in most artificial mineralized materials, as well as unique hydroplastic properties. This study opens the door for a scalable synthesis of resilient biophotonic structural materials in practical bulk form.

         <title>Metabolic Homeostasis&#8208;Regulated Nanoparticles for Antibody&#8208;Independent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

In order to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment aggravated by X&#8208;ray irradiation, a liposome loaded with mannose and levamisole (M/LM&#8208;Lipo) is developed for cellular metabolism regulation and macrophage polarization. The M/LM&#8208;Lipo orchestrates radio&#8208;immunotherapy by the simultaneous modulation of glucose and mitochondrial metabolic pathways in both cancer cells and macrophages, achieving systematic antitumor immune response for effective tumor ablation and metastasis elimination.








Abstract
The special metabolic traits of cancer cells and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are promising targets for developing novel cancer therapy strategies, especially the glycolysis and mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, therapies targeting a singular metabolic pathway are always counteracted by the metabolic reprogramming of cancer, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Herein, this work employs poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) liposomes as the drug delivery system for both mannose and levamisole hydrochloride to simultaneously inhibit glycolysis and restrain mitochondrial energy metabolism and thus inhibit tumor growth. In combination with radiotherapy, the liposomes can not only modulate the immunosuppressive TME by cellular metabolism regulation to achieve potent therapeutic effect for local tumors, but also suppress the M2 macrophage proliferation triggered by X&#8208;ray irradiation and thus enhance the immune response to inhibit metastatic lesions. In brief, this work provides a new therapeutic strategy targeting the special metabolic traits of cancer cells and immunosuppressive TAMs to enhance the abscopal effect of radiotherapy for cancer.

         <title>Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Nanocomposite Polymers for Durable Daytime Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The issue of durability related to mechanical and UV properties of radiative cooling materials needs to be addressed for practical applications. A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired design of nanocomposite polymers with K2Ti6O13 nanofiber dopants for enhancing the durability without compromising their cooling performance is proposed. This work provides a general strategy to enhance the durability of polymer&#8208;based PDRC materials&#160;toward large&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) materials, that strongly reflect sunlight and emit thermal radiation to outer space, demonstrate great potential in energy&#8208;saving for sustainable development. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based PDRC materials, with advantages of easy&#8208;processing, low cost, and outstanding cooling performance, have attracted intense attention. However, just like other polymer devices (for example polymer solar cells) working under sunlight, the issue of durability related to mechanical and UV properties needs to be addressed for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Here, a spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired design of nanocomposite polymers with potassium titanate (K2Ti6O13) nanofiber dopants is proposed for enhancing the durability without compromising their cooling performance. The formed tough interface of nanofiber/polymer effectively disperses stress, enhancing the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix; while the K2Ti6O13 can absorb high&#8208;energy UV photons and transform them into less harmful heat, thereby improving the UV stabilities. Taking poly(ethylene oxide) radiative cooler as an example for demonstration, its Young's modulus and UV resistance increase by 7 and 12 times, respectively. Consequently, the solar reflectance of nanocomposite poly(ethylene oxide) is maintained as constant in a&#160;continuous aging test for 720&#160;h under outdoor sunlight. The work provides a general strategy to simultaneously enhance both the mechanical stability and the UV durability of polymer&#8208;based PDRC materials&#160;toward large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Photothermal Nanozyme&#8208;Based Microneedle Patch against Refractory Bacterial Biofilm Infection via Iron&#8208;Actuated Janus Ion Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nanozyme&#8208;based microneedle patch FGO@MN is fabricated for eliminating refractory bacterial biofilm infections. FGO@MN disrupts the bacterial biofilm heat&#8208;shock response and induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death in bacterial biofilm. Simultaneously, the suppressed neutrophils in biofilm microenvironment acquire iron nutrition to reactivate antibiofilm immune response. This dual&#8208;modulation of iron metabolism by FGO@MN is referred to as a novel iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy.








Abstract
Owing to high antibiotic resistance and thermotolerance, bacterial biofilm infections (BBIs) are refractory to elimination. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and metabolism, and bacteria can thus accumulate iron from surrounding cells to maintain biofilm formation and survival. Consequently, iron deficiency in the biofilm microenvironment (BME) leads to the functional failure of innate immune cells. Herein, a novel antibiofilm strategy of iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy (IJIT) is proposed to regulate iron metabolism in both bacterial biofilm and immune cells. A BME&#8208;responsive photothermal microneedle patch (FGO@MN) is synthesized by the growth of Fe3O4&#160;nanoparticles on graphene oxide nanosheets and then encapsulated in methacrylated hyaluronic acid needle tips. The catalytic product of &#183;OH by FGO@MN in BME disrupts the bacterial heat&#8208;shock proteins, coercing biofilm thermal sensitization. As synergistic mild photothermal treatment triggers iron uptake, the intracellular iron overload further induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, iron&#8208;nourished neutrophils around BME can be rejuvenated for reactivating the suppressed antibiofilm function. Thus, more than 95% BBIs elimination can be achieved by combining heat stress&#8208;triggered iron interference with iron&#8208;nutrient immune reactivation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments validate the scavenging of refractory BBI after 15&#160;days, suggesting the promising perspective of IJIT in future clinical application.

4.7 V Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 anode&#8208;free Li batteries with a reversible specific capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high capacity retention of 80% after 120 cycles are reported. With the nonflammable F&#8208;rich ionic liquid electrolyte and the seeding Si&#8208;PAN layer (950 nm), an enhanced safety and high&#8208;voltage anode&#8208;free Li battery without dendritic Li growth is demonstrated.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries employ in situ lithium&#8208;plated current collectors as negative electrodes to afford optimal mass and volumetric energy densities. The main challenges to such batteries include their poor cycling stability and the safety issues of the flammable organic electrolytes. Here, a high&#8208;voltage 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal battery is reported,&#160;which uses&#160;a Cu foil coated with a layer (&#8776;950&#160;nm) of silicon&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (Si&#8208;PAN, 25.5&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2) as the negative electrode, a high&#8208;voltage cobalt&#8208;free LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) as the positive electrode and a safe, nonflammable ionic liquid electrolyte composed of 4.5&#160;m lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propyl pyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Py13FSI) with 1 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as additive. The Si&#8208;PAN coating is found to seed the growth of lithium during charging, and reversibly expand/shrink during lithium plating/stripping over battery cycling. The wide&#8208;voltage&#8208;window electrolyte containing a high concentration of FSI&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; facilitates the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, affording a 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery with a reversible specific capacity of &#8776;120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high cycling stability (80% capacity retention after 120 cycles). These results represent the first anode&#8208;free Li battery with a high 4.7&#160;V discharge voltage and high safety.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electrolysis to Ethylene via Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Augmented CO2 Availability</title>

         <dc:description>
Efficient electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added chemicals requires gas diffusion electrode (GDE)&#8208;based electrolyzers. For high&#8208;rate ethylene (C2H4) production with *CO dimerization, a microenvironment with high CO2 availability near the active sites is essential. Metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;induced organic layers in the GDE enable augmentation of the local CO2 concentration and promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction at high current densities.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to ethylene (C2H4) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires fine control over the phase boundary of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to overcome the limit of CO2 solubility in aqueous electrolytes. Here, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;functionalized GDE design is presented, based on a catalysts:MOFs:hydrophobic substrate materials layered architecture, that leads to high&#8208;rate and selective C2H4 production in flow cells and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers. It is found that using electroanalysis and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), MOF&#8208;induced organic layers in GDEs augment the local CO2 concentration near the active sites of the Cu catalysts. MOFs with different CO2 adsorption abilities are used, and the stacking ordering of MOFs in the GDE is varied. While sputtering Cu on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) (Cu/PTFE) exhibits 43% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, 49% C2H4 FE at 1 A cm&#8722;2 is achieved on MOF&#8208;augmented GDEs in CO2RR. MOF&#8208;augmented GDEs are further evaluated in an MEA electrolyzer, achieving a C2H4 partial current density of 220&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2RR and 121&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR), representing 2.7&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold improvement in C2H4 production rate, compared to those obtained on bare Cu/PTFE.

         <title>Decoupled Electrochemical Hydrazine &#8220;Splitting&#8221; via a Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Hydrazine Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine battery is proposed for separate and efficient hydrogen generation by temporally decoupled hydrazine splitting. The battery, realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst, decouples the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (2H2O + 2e&#8722;&#160;&#8594; H2&#160;+ 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;)\[(1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4} + 2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^ - } \to 1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2} + 2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}} + 2{e^ - })\], which achieves separate hydrogen generation, ansimultaneously efficient hydrogen production with low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96%.








Abstract
Hydrogen generation via electrochemical splitting plays an important role to achieve hydrogen economy. However, the large&#8208;scale application is highly limited by high cost and low efficiency. Herein, a new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine (Zn&#8211;Hz) battery is proposed and realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on two separate cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution (discharge: 2H2O + 2e&#8722;&#160;&#8594; H2&#160;+ 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (charge: 1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;$1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4}{\bm{ + }}2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^{\bm{ - }}}{\bm{ \to }}1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{\bm{ + }}2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}}{\bm{ + }}2{e^{\bm{ - }}}$). This Zn&#8211;Hz battery, driven by temporally decoupled electrochemical hydrazine splitting on the cathode during discharge and charge processes, can generate separated hydrogen without purification. When the highly active bifunctional cathode of 3D Mo2C/Ni@C/CS is paired with Zn foil, the Zn&#8211;Hz battery can achieve efficient hydrogen generation with a low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V (77.2&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and high energy efficiency of 96%. Remarkably, this battery exhibits outstanding long&#8208;term stability for 600 cycles (200&#160;h), achieving continuous hydrogen production on demand, which presents great potential for practical application.

         <title>Coexistence of Urbach&#8208;Tail&#8208;Like Localized States and Metallic Conduction Channels in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Curved Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen doping on 3D curved graphene leads to the coexistence of an Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized state and a metallic state. The dual nature of the electronic states can be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption, and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N) doping is one of the most effective approaches to tailor the chemical and physical properties of graphene. By the interplay between N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene lattices, N&#8208;doped 3D graphene displays superior performance in electrocatalysis and solar&#8208;energy harvesting for energy and environmental applications. However, the electrical transport properties and the electronic states, which are the key factors to understand the origins of the N&#8208;doping effect in 3D graphene, are still missing. The electronic properties of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene are systematically investigated by an electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor method. It is demonstrated that Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized states are located around the neutral point of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene with the background metallic transport channels. The dual nature of electronic states, generated by the synergistic effect of N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene, can be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption, and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.

         <title>A Wide Bandgap Halide Perovskite Based Self&#8208;Powered Blue Photodetector with 84.9% of External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance and self&#8208;powered blue perovskite photodetector (PPD) is developed by designing and optimizing A&#8208;site of APb(Br0.65Cl0.35)3 (A = formamidinium (FA+), methylammonium (MA+), Cs+) perovskites (PVSKs). The incorporation of Cs+ into FA/MA&#8208;PVSKs reduces the lattice strain and defect density. Consequently, a best&#8208;performing Cs&#8208;incorporating device shows an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9% which is the highest EQE reported in blue PDs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, color&#8208;filter&#8208;free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites is reported. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A&#8208;site monovalent cations of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs+ ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increases charge&#8208;carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215; 1012 Jones under blue light. Furthermore, Cs+ improves durability under repetitive operations and ambient atmosphere. The proposed device exhibits peak responsivity of 0.307&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, which is higher than that of the commercial InGaN&#8208;based blue PD (0.289&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1). This study will promote the development of next&#8208;generation image sensors with vertically stacked perovskite PDs.

     alt="A Wide Bandgap Halide Perovskite Based Self-Powered Blue Photodetector with 84.9% of External Quantum Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high-performance and self-powered blue perovskite photodetector (PPD) is developed by designing and optimizing A-site of APb(Br&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.35&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (A = formamidinium (FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), methylammonium (MA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) perovskites (PVSKs). The incorporation of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; into FA/MA-PVSKs reduces the lattice strain and defect density. Consequently, a best-performing Cs-incorporating device shows an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9% which is the highest EQE reported in blue PDs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-powered, color-filter-free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites is reported. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A-site monovalent cations of wide-bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increases charge-carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; Jones under blue light.

Tetradentate gold(III) thermally activated delayed fluorescent complexes, showing&#160;green emission with near&#8208;unity &#934; and kr approaching 2 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films,&#160;are reported. The vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them demonstrate maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 27% with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs and LT90 device lifetimes of up to 1820 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
High maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax), small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and long operational lifetime at practical luminances are three crucial parameters for commercialization of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To simultaneously achieve these goals, it is desirable to have the radiative decay rate constant (kr) as large as possible, which, for a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitter, requires both a large S1&#8594;S0 radiative decay rate constant (krS) and a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Here, the design of a class of tetradentate gold(III) TADF complexes for narrowing the &#916;EST while keeping the krS large is reported. The as&#8208;synthesized complexes display green emission with close to unity emission quantum yields, and kr approaching 2&#160;&#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films. The vacuum&#8208;deposited green OLEDs based on 1 and 4 demonstrate maximum EQEs of up to 24 and 27% with efficiency roll&#8208;offs of 5.5 and 2.2% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively; the EQEs maintain high at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 (19% (1) and 24% (4)). A long LT90 device lifetime of 1820&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for complex 1 is achieved, which is one of the longest device lifetimes of TADF&#8208;OLEDs reported in the literature.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Accelerated Development of Efficient Mixed Protonic&#8211;Electronic Conducting Oxides as the Air Electrodes for Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning models are constructed to predict the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of the 3200 newly mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Subsequently, the screened oxide (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 with the highest HPC is synthesized, and it is applied as an air electrode for the protonic ceramic cells operating in both electrolysis and fuel cell modes at intermediate temperatures.








Abstract
Currently, the development of high&#8208;performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes. Despite the extensive research efforts in the past decades, the development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides still remains in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, which is extremely time consuming and high cost. Herein, based on the data acquired from the published literature, the machine&#8208;learning (ML) method is introduced to accelerate the discovery of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Accordingly, the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of 3200 oxides is predicted to evaluate the proton conduction that is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of PCCs. Subsequently, feature importance for HPC is evaluated to establish a guideline for rapid and accurate design and development of high&#8208;efficiency mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Thereafter, screened (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 (LCCN7382) is prepared, and the experimental HPC adequately corresponds with the predicted results. Moreover, the PCC with LCCN7382 exhibits satisfactory electrochemical performances in electrolysis and fuel cell modes. In addition to the development of a promising air electrode for PCC, this study establishes a new avenue for ML&#8208;based development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides.

         <title>Rapidly Photocurable Solid&#8208;State Poly(ionic liquid) Ionogels For Thermally Robust and Flexible Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization of rationally formulated poly(ionic liquid) ionogels enables rapid curing within a minute, forming highly transparent and stretchable electrolytes with excellent thermal, electrochemical, and air stability for high&#8208;performance electrochromic devices&#160;that are operable over wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). These ionogels are used to construct curved electrochromic eye protectors and flexible electrochromic displays, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.








Abstract
Formation of ionogels through in situ polymerization can effectively improve electrolyte processability; however, the curing process has been slow and oxygen&#8208;sensitive. Considering the low oxygen solubility of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs), in situ polymerized ionogels are designed to realize excellent electrolytes. Herein, two in situ polymerized ionogels (PIL A &amp; PIL B) are formulated, and they can be rapidly photocured within a minute. The ionogels are highly transparent, stretchable, and exhibit excellent physicochemical stability, including thermal, electrochemical, and air stability, allowing them to perform in various conditions. Benefitting from these properties, two high&#8208;performance electrochromic devices (ECDs) are assembled, with iron&#8208;centered coordination polymer (FeCP) and tungsten oxide (P&#8208;WO3) electrochromic materials, achieving high color contrast (45.2% and 56.4%), fast response time (1.5/1.9 and 1.7/6.4 s), and excellent cycling endurance (&gt;90% retention over 3000 cycles). Attributed to the thermal robustness of the ionogels, the ECDs can also be operated over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). With the use of deformable substrates (e.g., ultrathin ITO glass), curved electrochromic eye protector and flexible electrochromic displays are realized, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.

         <title>A Zn8 Double&#8208;Cavity Metallacalix[8]arene as Molecular Sieve to Realize Self&#8208;Cleaning Intramolecular Tandem Transformation of Li&#8722;S Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intramolecular relay transformation mechanism of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is realized exclusively by the delicately&#8208;designed Zn8 clusters, which originates from the synergy of steric hindrance within Zn8 clusters and selective adsorption of LiPSs to the active site in Zn8 clusters. This unique mechanism innovatively realizes the self&#8208;cleaning of active sites and continuous electrochemistry for Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Toward the well&#8208;explored lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) catalytic chemistry, the slow adsorption&#8208;migration&#8208;conversion kinetics of lithium polysulfides on catalytic materials and Li2S deposition&#8208;induced passivation of active sites limit the rapid and complete conversion of sulfur. Conceptively, molecular architectures can provide atom&#8208;precise models to understand the underlying active sites responsible for selective adsorption and conversion of LiPSs and Li2S2/Li2S species. Here, an octanuclear Zn(II) (Zn8) cluster is presented, which features a metallacalix[8]arene with double cavities up and down the Zn8 ring. The central Zn8 ring and the specific double cavities with organic ligands of different electronegativity and bonding environments render active sites with variable steric hindrance and interaction toward the sulfur&#8208;borne species. An intramolecular tandem transformation mechanism is realized exclusively by Zn8 cluster, which promotes the self&#8208;cleaning of active sites and continuous electrochemical reaction. Notably, the external azo groups and internal Zn/O sites of Zn8 cluster in sequence stimulate the adsorption and conversion of long chain Li2Sx (x&#160;&#8805; 4) and short chain Li2S/Li2S2, contributing to remarkable rate performance and cycling stability. This work pioneers the application of metallacalix[n]arene clusters with atom&#8208;precise structure in Li&#8722;S batteries, and the proposed mechanism advances the molecule&#8208;level understanding of Li&#8722;S catalytic chemistry.

         <title>A Perovskite Photodetector Crossbar Array by Vapor Deposition for Dynamic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite photodiode&#8211;blocking diode crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by vapor deposition method is presented, which shows a large rectification ratio and suppresses electrical crosstalk in the imaging array. Its fast response time allows smooth&#160;real&#8208;time image acquisition. The imaging sensor exhibits excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range and is sensitive to weak light.








Abstract
With the development of perovskite photodetectors, integrating photodetectors into array image sensors is the next target to pursue. The major obstacle to integrating perovskite photodiodes for dynamic imaging is the optoelectrical crosstalk among the pixels. Herein, a perovskite photodiode&#8211;blocking diode (PIN&#8208;BD) crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by the vapor deposition method is presented. The PIN&#8208;BD shows a large rectification ratio of 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;102 under illumination, suppressing electrical crosstalk to as small as 8.0% in the imaging array. The fast response time of 72.8&#160;ns allows real&#8208;time image acquisition by over 25 frames per second. The imaging sensor exhibits excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range of 112&#160;dB with 4096 gray levels and weak light sensitivity under 1.2&#160;lux.

         <title>Chiral Rashba Ferroelectrics for Circularly Polarized Light Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of 2D chiral perovskite Rashba ferroelectric semiconductors is reported. The fabricated single&#8208;crystal device responds to circularly polarized light (CPL) under 430&#160;nm with an anisotropy factor of 0.20 for the left&#8208; and right&#8208;CPL differentiation, about two times of reported pure chiral counterparts. The enhanced performance is ascribed to the Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus effect with a large Rashba coefficient of 0.93&#160;eV&#160;&#197;.








Abstract
Direct detection of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a challenging task due to limited materials and ambiguous structure&#8211;property relationships that lead to low distinguishability of the light helicities. Perovskite ferroelectric semiconductors incorporating chirality provide new opportunities in dealing with this issue. Herein, a pair of 2D chiral perovskite ferroelectrics is reported, which have&#160;enhanced CPL detection performance due to interplays among lattice, photon, charge, spin, and orbit. The chirality&#8208;transfer&#8208;induced chiral&amp;polar ferroelectric phase enhances the asymmetric nature of the photoactive sublattice and achieves a switchable self&#8208;powered detection via the bulk photovoltaic effect. The single&#8208;crystal&#8208;based device exhibits a CPL&#8208;sensitive detection performance under 430&#160;nm with an asymmetric factor of 0.20 for left&#8208; and right&#8208;CPL differentiation, about two times that of the pure chiral counterparts. The enhanced CPL detection performance is ascribed to the Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus effect that originates from the bulk inversion asymmetry and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, shown with a large Rashba coefficient, which is demonstrated by density functional theory calculation and circularly polarized light excited photoluminescence measurement. These results provide new perspectives on chiral Rashba ferroelectric semiconductors for direct CPL detection and ferroelectrics&#8208;based chiroptics and spintronics.

Perovskite Solar Cells
In article number 2204726, Juan&#8208;Pablo Correa&#8208;Baena and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the thermal instability of the bulky&#8208;cation interface layers used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art halide perovskite solar cells. Under thermal stress, the interface reconstructs, impacting charge&#8208;carrier dynamics and device operation. Characterization of bulky&#8208;cation interfaces before and after annealing to drive the selection of bulky cations toward efficient and stable devices is proposed.

Biomineralization
In article number 2206509, Rui Xiong, Helmut C&#246;lfen, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate an efficient and scalable artificial molting strategy to construct biomimetic photonic structural composites by the chiral nematic liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly of nanocellulose and subsequent mineralization of amorphous CaCO3. These biomimetic composites exhibit excellent mechanical properties as well as tunable chiral structural color and water&#8208;triggered switchable photonics that are absent in most artificial mineralized materials.

Viscoelastic Networks
In article number 2205649, Ho Cheung Shum and co&#8208;workers develop a new aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) that displays dynamic assembly of viscoelastic networks by aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2). Viscoelastic networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated DEX droplets as templates and the subsequent liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the PNIPAM&#8208;rich phase.

Blue Photodetectors
Vertically stacked blue/green/red photodetectors receive great attention for next&#8208;generation image sensors, where a high&#8208;performance blue device is the most important building block. In article 2206932, Gill Sang Han, Hyun Suk Jung, Sangwook Lee, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered blue photodetector based on wide&#8208;bandgap halide perovskites. Outstanding external quantum efficiency (84.9%) and responsivity (0.307 A W&#8722;1) with improved stability is achieved by compositional engineering.

Graphene Nanopores
In article number 2206627, Kumar Varoon Agrawal and co&#8208;workers describe how &#229;ngstrom&#8208;scale pores are generated in graphene at a desired site, on demand, by controlled gasification of pre&#8208;formed epoxy clusters. This strategy allows independent control of pore density and pore size. The illustration shows CO2 released from the gasification event.

         <title>Looking Beyond 0 and 1: Principles and Technology of Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) is an effective means of increasing the bit density and reducing the power consumptions of modern chips. A comprehensive review and classification of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art compact MVL unit devices is presented. Special emphasis is placed on a comparative discussion of advantages and limitations of each class of MVL devices.








Abstract
Ever since the invention of solid&#8208;state transistors, binary devices have dominated the electronics industry. Although the binary technology links the natural property of devices to be in the ON or OFF state with two logic levels, it provides the least possible information content per interconnect. Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) has long been considered as a means of improving the computation efficiency and reducing the power consumption of modern chips. In view of the power density limits of the conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology, MVL technologies have recently gained even more attention, and various MVL unit devices based on conventional and emerging materials have been proposed. Herein, the recent&#160;achievements toward the development of compact MVL unit devices are reviewed. First, basic principles of MVL technologies are introduced by describing methods of obtaining multiple logic states and discussing radix&#8208;related aspects of MVL computation. Next, MVL unit devices are classified and overviewed with emphasis on principles of operation, technologies, and applications. Finally, a&#160;comparative discussion of strengths and weaknesses is provided for each class of MVL devices, and the review concludes with the outlook for the MVL field.

First, basic principles of MVL technologies are introduced by describing methods of obtaining multiple logic states and discussing radix-related aspects of MVL computation. Next, MVL unit devices are classified and overviewed with emphasis on principles of operation, technologies, and applications. Finally, a&#160;comparative discussion of strengths and weaknesses is provided for each class of MVL devices, and the review concludes with the outlook for the MVL field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functional MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 51, December 22, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategies that developed to functionalize MXene&#8208;based materials, including tailoring their microstructure by ions/molecules/polymers&#8208;initiated interaction or self&#8208;assembly, surface/interface engineering with dopants or functional groups, constructing heterostructures from MXenes with various materials, and transforming them into a series of derivatives inheriting the merits of the MXene precursors, are highlighted.








Abstract
MXenes are seen as an exceptional candidate to reshape the future of energy with their viable surface chemistry, ultrathin 2D structure, and excellent electronic conductivity. The extensive research efforts bring about rapid expansion of the MXene families with enriched functionalities, which significantly boost performance of the existing energy&#8208;storage devices. In this review, the strategies that are developed to functionalize the MXene&#8208;based materials, including tailoring their microstructure by ions/molecules/polymers&#8208;initiated interaction or self&#8208;assembly, surface/interface engineering with dopants or functional groups, constructing heterostructures from MXenes with various materials, and transforming them into a series of derivatives inheriting the merits of the MXene precursors are highlighted. Their applications in emerging battery technologies are demonstrated and discussed. With delicate functionalization and structural engineering, MXene&#8208;based electrode materials exhibit improved specific capacity and rate capability, and their presence further suppresses and even eliminates dendrite formation on the metal anodes, which lengthens the lifespan of the rechargeable batteries. Meanwhile, MXenes serve as additives for electrolytes, separators, and current collectors. Finally, some future directions worth of exploration to address the remaining challenging issues of MXene&#8208;based materials and achieve the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;power and low&#8208;cost rechargeable batteries are proposed.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density Over 270 wh/kg</title>

Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers emerged at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 KJ/mol. At the meantime, we proposed the adoption sodium cations (Na+) as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and further identified a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8764;18.5&#160;mg/cm2) delivers a capacity high as 125.1 mAh/g under &#8208;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh/Kg graphite/NCM pouch cell was assembled, and by elevating the cutoff voltage to 4.6&#160;V, the cell affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh/g under &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work would propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperature than ever before.

Abstract
Flexible energy&#8208;storage devices laid the foundation for a convenient, advanced, fossil fuel&#8208;free society. However, the fabrication of flexible energy&#8208;storage devices remains a tremendous challenge due to the intrinsic dissimilarities between electrode and electrolyte. In this study, we proposed a strategy for fabricating the flexible electrode and electrolyte entirely inside a matrix. First, we designed a nest&#8208;structural and redox&#8208;active ionohydrogel with excellent stretchability (up to 3000%) and conductivity (167.9 mS/cm) using a hydrated ionic liquid (HIL) solvent and chemical foaming strategy. The nest&#8208;structure ionohydrogel provided sufficient &#8220;highways&#8221; and &#8220;service area&#8221;, and the cation in HIL facilitated the reaction, transportation, and deposition of benzoquinone. Subsequently, we in&#8208;situ fabricated a novel benzoquinone crystal&#8208;gel interface (CGI) on the surface of the ionohydrogel through electrochemical deposition of benzoquinone. Thus, we successfully achieved an integrated CGI&#8208;gel platform with a middle body as an electrolyte and the surficial redox&#8208;active CGI membrane for electrochemical energy conversion and storage. Based on the CGI&#8208;gel platform, an extreme simple and effective &#8220;stick&#8208;to&#8208;use&#8221; strategy was proposed for constructing flexible energy&#8208;storage devices and then we fabricated a series of flexible supercapatteries with high stretchability and capacitance (5222.1 mF/cm2 at 600% strain), low self&#8208;discharge and interfacial resistance and a wearable, self&#8208;power and intelligent display.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive STAT3 Inhibitor Nanoprodrug Combined with Oncolytic Virus Elicits Synergistic Antitumor Immune Responses by Igniting Pyroptosis</title>

Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy shows excellent efficacy against malignancies; however, insufficient tumor immunogenicity and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are considered as the two major stumbling blocks to a broad ICB response. Here, we report a combinational therapeutic strategy combining tumor microenvironment reactive oxygen species (ROS)/pH dual&#8208;responsive signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor nanoprodrugs MPNPs with oncolytic herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV&#8208;1) virotherapy to synergistically ignite pyroptosis for enhancing immunotherapy. MPNPs exhibited a certain level of tumor accumulation, reduce tumor cell stemness, and enhance antitumor immune responses. Furthermore, the simultaneous application of oncolytic viruses (OVs) confers MPNPs with higher tumor penetration capacity and remarkable gasdermin E&#8208;mediated pyroptosis, thereby reshaping the tumor microenvironment and transforming &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors into &#8220;hot&#8221; ones. This &#8220;fire of immunity&#8221; strategy successfully activates robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor responses, potentiating ICB effects against local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis in preclinical &#8220;cold&#8221; murine triple&#8208;negative breast cancer and syngeneic oral cancer models. Collectively, this work may pave a new way and offer an unprecedented opportunity for the combination of OVs with nanomedicine for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homojunction Organic Nonfullerene Photovoltaics Featuring Fundamentals Distinct from Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonfullerene organic solar cells based on quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804;10 wt.%) are fabricated. A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.








Abstract
In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll&#8208;off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7&#8208;Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.

A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high-efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi-homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high-efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7-Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll-off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7-Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Implantable Magnetic Vascular Scaffold for Circulating Tumor Cell Removal In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a new type of vascular&#8208;like ITD with artificial adhesion repertoires and a wireless magnetothermal response for high metastatic circulating tumor cell removal in vivo is proposed. The ITD implanted in the artery mainly comprises PLLA fibers encapsulated with FeCo@G and a 3D structure with HA and gelatin for the preparation of bioinspired adhesive sites.








Abstract
An integrated trapped device (ITD) capable of removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can assuage or even prevent metastasis. However, adhesion repertoires are ordinarily neglected in the design of ITDs, possibly leading to the omission of highly metastatic CTC and treatment failure. Here a vascular&#8208;like ITD with adhesive sites and wireless magnetothermal response to remove highly metastatic CTC in vivo is presented. Such a vascular&#8208;like ITD comprises circumferential well&#8208;aligned fibers and artificial adhesion repertoires and is optimized for magnetothermal integration. Continuous and repeated capture in a dynamic environment increases capture efficiency over time. Meanwhile, the heat generation of the ITD leads to the capture of CTC death owing to cell heat sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed bioinspired ultrastructure of the ITD prevents vascular blockage and induces potential vascular regeneration. Overall, this work defines an extendable strategy for constructing adhesion repertoires against intravascular shear forces, provides a vascular&#8208;like ITD for reducing CTC counts, and is expected to alleviate the risk of cancer recurrence.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of High&#8208;Quality Graphene Films via Electrostatic&#8208;Repulsion Aligning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films are assembled from pristine graphene nanosheets via electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning where highly electronegative titania nanosheets play a key role. The obtained graphene films present significantly enhanced mechanical properties and electrical properties for electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal&#8208;management multifunctional applications in smart and wearable electronics.








Abstract
Assembling pristine graphene into freestanding films featuring high electrical conductivity, superior flexibility, and robust mechanical strength aims at meeting the all&#8208;around high criteria of new&#8208;generation electronics. However, voids and defects produced in the macroscopic assembly process of graphene nanosheets severely degrade the performance of graphene films, and mechanical brittleness often limits their applications in wide scenarios. To address such challenges, an electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning strategy is demonstrated to produce highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films. Typically, the high electronegativity of titania nanosheets (TiNS) induces the aligning of negatively charged graphene nanosheets via electrostatic repulsion in the film assembly. The resultant graphene films show fine microstructure, enhanced mechanical properties, and improved electrical conductivity up to 1.285 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1. Moreover, the graphene films can withstand 5000 repeated folding without structural damage and electrical resistance fluctuation. These comprehensive improved properties, combined with the facile synthesis method and scalable production, make these graphene films a promising platform for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal&#8208;management applications in smart and wearable electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micropollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular engineering of amorphous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) successfully generates hydrophilic porous materials, which exhibit an exceptional removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% of phenol derivatives) and excellent recyclability. The photothermal characteristics of oxidized CTFs show a high volatile organic compound (VOC) rejection rate (&#8776;98% of phenol). Synergistic interplay of high&#8208;performance adsorption and solar&#8208;driven evaporation enables complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of mixture of phenol derivatives.








Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires an energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% in 10&#160;s) and can be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Quaternary 2D BiCuSeO p&#8208;Type Semiconductor with Intrinsic Degeneracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets with heteroanionic crystal structure are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Its intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy is systemically revealed and leveraged for fabricating 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors. These results significantly boost the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of tunnel devices.








Abstract
2D BiCuSeO is an intrinsic p&#8208;type degenerate semiconductor due to its self&#8208;doping effect, which possesses great potential to fabricate high&#8208;performance 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs). However, the controllable synthesis of multinary 2D materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still a challenge due to the restriction of thermodynamics. Here, the CVD synthesis of quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets is realized. As&#8208;grown BiCuSeO nanosheets with thickness down to &#8776;6.1&#160;nm (&#8776;7 layers) and domain size of &#8776;277&#160;&#181;m show excellent ambient stability. Intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, capable of maintaining even in a few layers, is comprehensively unveiled. By varying the thicknesses and temperatures, the carrier concentration of BiCuSeO nanosheets can be adjusted in the range of 1019 to 1021 cm&#8722;3, and the Hall mobility of BiCuSeO is &#8776;191 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (at 2 K). Furthermore, taking advantage of the p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, a prototypical BiCuSeO/MoS2 TFET is fabricated. The emergence of the negative differential resistance trend and multifunctional diodes by modulating the gate voltage and temperature reveal the great practical implementation potential of BiCuSeO nanosheets. These results pave way for the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of high&#8208;performance tunnel devices.

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis and Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered polymeric adsorbent (SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively adsorb chemo exposure in the GI tract is developed. The SPORA&#8208;SN9 sharply decreases the toxic chemo content of the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen, thereby preventing chemo&#8208;induced GI mucositis and chemo&#8208;induced microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the protected gut microbiome improves the antitumor efficacy of the followed immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) is reported, which can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protects the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol is achieved in a flow&#8208;cell, which is enabled by V&#8208;doped Cu2Se hierarchical nanotubes. The hierarchical nanotubes meet the requirement for flow&#8208;cells while the V doping steers the reaction pathway toward ethanol production.








Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products is heavily pursued because of their commercial values, and the efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. A flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, it is reported that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cells and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by the experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and, as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens an avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>Robust and Multifunctional Kirigami Electronics with a Tough and Permeable Aramid Nanofiber Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing robust and multifunctional kirigami electronics for wearable applications imposes strict restrictions on the constituent materials. In this work, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto the CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve measurements of physiological parameters.








Abstract
Kirigami designs are advantageous for the construction of wearable electronics due to their high stretchability and conformability on the 3D dynamic surfaces of the skin. However, suitable materials technologies that enable robust kirigami devices with desired functionality for skin&#8208;interfaces remain limited. Here, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. The self&#8208;assembled fibrillar network involving aramid nanofibers and poly(vinyl alcohol) combines high toughness, permeability, and manufacturability, which are desirable for the fabrication of hybrid devices. Multiscale simulations are conducted to explain the high fracture resistance of the&#160;CNFF&#8208;based kirigami structures and provide essential guidance for the design, which can be further generalized to other kirigami devices. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto a CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyogram (EMG), skin&#8208;temperature measurements, and measurement of other physiological parameters. These mechanically robust, multifunctional, lightweight, and biocompatible kirigami devices can shed new insights for the development of advanced wearable systems and human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, Long&#8208;Range Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides and two crystalline cobalt oxides are studied in&#160;situ to deduce the role of the reconstruction conditions, the effect of the electrolyte, and structure&#8211;activity relations for near&#8208;neutral water oxidation. Multiple aspects are considered and interconnected, deducing a comprehensive concept for the different electrocatalytic performances, including mass transport.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same short&#8208;range order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#183;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface. Ex situ and in situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass&#8208;transport limitations, a comprehensive picture is provided explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bonded buffers, and the morphology. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in near&#8208;neutral potassium borate medium at 1.62&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;month without degrading performance.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Assisted Cobalt Ditelluride Polyhedra Inducing Lattice Strain to Endow Efficient Adsorption&#8208;Catalysis for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Lattice strain generated by Zn&#8208;doped CoTe2 polyhedra balances the intrinsic catalytic effect and the adsorption of polysulfides, and the catalytic mechanism for accelerating polysulfide conversion is verified in combination with d&#8208;band center theory, Bader charge, and Gibbs free energy. It offers a guiding idea for the device of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Developing a conductive catalyst with high catalytic activity is considered to be an effective strategy for improving cathode kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially at large current density and with lean electrolytes. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering has been a strategy to tune the local structure of catalysts and to help understand the structure&#8211;activity relationship between strain and catalyst performance. Here, Co0.9Zn0.1Te2@NC is constructed after zinc atoms are uniformly doped into the CoTe2 lattice. The experimental/theoretical results indicate that a change of the coordination environment for the cobalt atom by the lattice strain modulates the d&#8208;band center with more electrons occupied in antibonding orbitals, thus balancing the adsorption of polysulfides and the intrinsic catalytic effect, thereby activating the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Benefiting from the merits, with only 4 wt% dosages of catalyst in the cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 1 C and stable cycling performances are achieved for 1500/2500 cycles at 1 C/2 C. Upon sulfur loading of 7.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the areal capacity can reach 12.8 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work provides a guiding methodology for the design of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies for the rational design of cathode in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Decorated Nanostructure for Precision Sonodynamic&#8208;Catalytic Therapy of MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable nanostructure is developed and assessed for outstanding biofilm disruption effect by capturing bacteria and penetrating biofilm matrix of guanidinium, and the synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic effect. The remotely controlled nanostructure efficiently clears infection and mediates the inflammation resolution in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;infected osteomyelitis, thus providing a novel sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy for osteomyelitis.








Abstract
Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life&#8208;threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep&#8208;seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy of MRSA&#8208;infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium&#8208;rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)&#8208;absorbing gold&#8208;doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep&#8208;penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates 1O2 for sonodynamic therapy and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into toxic &#8226;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria&#8208;capturing ability, the biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and the subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to M2&#8208;type while suppressing the M1&#8208;type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.

         <title>Dense Local Triplet States and Steric Shielding of a Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enable High&#8208;Performance Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.132, 0.092), narrow full width at half maximum of 22&#160;nm, and high external quantum efficiency of 23.4% is developed by introducing bulky biphenyls and N&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;N&#8208;ortho&#8208;dimethylphenylamine that create dense local triplet states and suppress intramolecular aggregation. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules based on boron and nitrogen atoms are emerging as next&#8208;generation blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrow emission spectra and triplet harvesting properties. However, intermolecular aggregation stemming from the planar structure of typical MR&#8208;TADF molecules that leads to concentration quenching and broadened spectra limits the utilization of the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Herein, a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me, is developed to suppress intermolecular interactions effectively. Furthermore, photophysical investigation and theoretical calculations reveal that adding biphenyl moieties to the core body creates dense local triplet states in the vicinity of S1 and T1 energetically, letting the emitter harvest excitons efficiently. OLEDs based on pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a pure&#8208;blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.132, 0.092), which are maintained even at a high doping concentration of 100&#160;wt%. Furthermore, by incorporating a conventional TADF sensitizer, deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIE value of (0.133, 0.109) and an extremely high EQE of 30.1% are realized. These findings provide insight into design strategies for developing efficient deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters with fast triplet upconversion and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation.

         <title>Direct Observation of Self&#8208;Hybridized Exciton&#8208;Polaritons and Their Valley Polarizations in a Bare WS2 Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized exciton&#8208;polaritons in a bare WS2 layer is reported. The polariton emission is demonstrated to be controllable by varying the thickness of the sample or excitation power. It is also shown that the polariton inherits the valley degree of freedom from excitons and exhibits high valley polarization (Pv =&#160;0.18) at room temperature.








Abstract
The strong excitonic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have led to the successful demonstration of exciton&#8208;polaritons (EPs) in various optical cavity structures. Recently, self&#8208;hybridized EPs have been discovered in a bare TMD layer, but experimental investigation is still lacking because of their nonradiative nature. Herein, the direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized EPs in a bare multilayer WS2 via the evanescent field coupling technique is reported. Because of the thickness&#8208;dependent Rabi splitting energy, the dispersion curves of the EPs change sensitively with sample thickness. Moreover, continuous tuning of EP dispersion curves is demonstrated by controlling the excitation laser power. Lastly, it is observed that guided EPs retain valley polarization up to 0.2 at room temperature, representing a valley&#8208;preserved strong coupling regime. It is believed that the high tunability and valley polarization properties of the guided EPs in bare TMD layers can facilitate new nanophotonic and valleytronic applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Sustainable Defect&#8208;Passivation for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable dynamic passivation strategy by incorporating a photoisomeric molecule is put forward, which greatly enhances the photostability of perovskite photovoltaics. This dynamic strategy pays attention to and well matches the dynamics of defect generation during operation. The characteristics of the changeable molecular structure enable us to cope with defects updated in operation without introducing excess active sites.








Abstract
The generation of photoinduced defects and freely moving halogen ions is dynamically updated in real time. Accordingly, most reported strategies are static and short&#8208;term, which make their improvements in photostability very limited. Therefore, seeking new passivation strategies to match the dynamic characteristics of defect generation is very urgent. Without newly generated defects, a passivation molecule should exist in the configuration that would not become the initiation sites for defect generation. With newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should transfer into the other configuration that possesses the passivation sites. Herein, a classical photoisomeric molecule, spiropyran, is adopted, whose pre&#8208; and post&#8208;isomeric forms meet the requirements for two different configurations, to realize the state transition once the photoinduced defects appear during subsequent operation and dynamic capture for continuous renewal of defects. Consequently, spiropyrans work as light&#8208;triggered and self&#8208;healing sustainable passivation sites to realize continuous defect repair. The target devices retain 93% and 99% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 456&#160;h aging under ultraviolet illumination and 1200&#160;h aging under full&#8208;spectrum illumination, respectively. This work provides a novel concept of sustainable passivation strategy to realize continuous defect&#8208;passivation and film&#8208;healing in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Pd&#8211;Sb Rhombohedra with an Unconventional Rhombohedral Phase as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra&#160;with exposed (003) facets are successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient trifunctional catalysts. The specific ordered arrangement of Pd and Sb atoms on the Pd20Sb7(003) facet not only lowers the oxygen binding energy to an optimal value for the oxygen reduction reaction, but also reduces CO binding for superior resistance to CO poisoning during the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering is an important strategy for designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts with optimized activity and stability. From the thermodynamic point of view, it remains a great challenge to synthesize unconventional phases of noble metals. Here, a new class of Pd&#8208;based nanostructure with unconventional rhombohedral Pd20Sb7 phase is successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the high proportion of the unique exposed Pd20Sb7 (003) surface, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra display much enhanced ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction performance compared with commercial Pd/C. Moreover, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra are also demonstrated as an effective air cathode in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8211;air batteries with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH3CO* to CH3COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble AIEgen for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Kidney Fibrosis via SWIR Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly nanoprobe, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics is elaborately designed and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression, specifically 1 week of modeling, via short&#8208;wave infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The high renal clearance efficiency, outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive for renal fibrosis detection in preclinical settings.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of renal fibrosis is crucially significant on account of its worldwide prevalent tendency. Optical imaging in the near&#8208;infrared window has been recognized as an appealing technique for the timely detection of renal dysfunction. However, formulating a contrast agent that allows early monitoring of renal fibrosis and concurrently renally clearable in a normal group is still challenging. Herein, a nanosized fluorophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, is well&#8208;tailored and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression specifically in the early&#8208;stage via short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The small size (&#8776;26&#160;nm), renally filtrable molecular weight (3.3&#160;kDa), high renal clearance efficiency (93.1 &#177; 1.7% excretion through the kidneys within 24&#160;h), outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility, together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive and far superior to clinical diagnostic assays. The finding in this study would provide a blueprint for the next generation of diagnostic agents for the extent of renal fibrosis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered, Implantable, and Wirelessly Controlled NO Generation System for Intracranial Neuroglioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated and self&#8208;powered NO generation system for intracranial glioma gas therapy is designed. The NO releasing device, which is intracranially&#160;implanted, can be driven by a wearable triboelectric nanogenerator, and the system is wirelessly operated by a smartphone to control NO release for efficient intracranial glioma therapy.








Abstract
Gas therapy is an emerging technology for improving cancer therapy with high efficiency and low side effects. However, due to the existence of the gatekeeper of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the limited availability of current drug delivery systems, there still have been no reports on gas therapy for intracranial neuroglioma. Herein, an integrated, self&#8208;powered, and wirelessly controlled gas&#8208;therapy system is reported, which is composed of a self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self&#8208;driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self&#8208;controlled power source. When delivering energy to light a&#160;light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. The efficacy of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats is verified. This self&#8208;powered gas&#8208;therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.

         <title>Shining Transparent Displays with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent displays have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. In this work, the novel narrow&#8208;band blue&#8208;emitting NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design for transparent display. The fabricated prototype can render &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle and large color gamut.








Abstract
Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow-band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, the novel narrow-band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity, and good reliability, and the TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8211;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and microstructural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8776; 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;&lt;sub&gt;cfs&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8776; 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776; 3; &lt;i&gt;&#295;&#969;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776; 285 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

A facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the fast synthesis of fully conjugated phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The as&#8208;prepared COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries with the achievement of a high reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;due to their good conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature.








Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (BBTC) and quinoxalino[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (QPPTC) in ZnCl2&#160;leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8211;1.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 100&#160;cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;for over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>Donor End&#8208;Capped Alkyl Chain Length Dependent Non&#8208;Radiative Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>

MPhS&#8208;C2 with shortened terminal alkyl chain, features thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condense packing, leading to suppressed upshifts of highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and efficient charge transport at small phase separation in BTP&#8208;eC9 blended devices, obtaining the highest PCE of 17.11% with &#916;Vnr of 0.192 V in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
A critical bottleneck for further efficiency breakthroughs in organic solar cells (OSCs) is to minimize the non&#8208;radiative energy loss (e&#916;Vnr) while maximizing the charge generation. With the development of highly emissive low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, the design of high&#8208;performance donors becomes critical to enable the blend with the electroluminescence quantum efficiency to approach or surpass the pristine acceptor. Herein, by shortening the end&#8208;capped alkyl chains of the small&#8208;molecular donors from hexyl (MPhS&#8208;C6) to ethyl (MPhS&#8208;C2), the material obtained aggregation that was&#160;insensitive to thermal annealing (TA) along with&#160;condensed packing simultaneously. The former leads to small phase separation and suppressed upshifts of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and the latter facilitates its efficient charge&#8208;transport at aggregation&#8208;less packing. Hence, the &#916;Vnr decreases from 0.242 to 0.182&#160;V, from MPhS&#8208;C6 to MPhS&#8208;C2 based OSCs. An excellent PCE of 17.11% is obtained by 1,8&#8208;diiodoctane addition due to almost unchanged high Jsc (26.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Voc (0.888&#160;V) with improved fill factor, which is the record efficiency with the smallest energy loss (0.497&#160;eV) and &#916;Vnr (0.192&#160;V) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs. These results emphasize the potential material design direction of obtaining concurrent TA&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condensed packing to maximize the device performances with a super low &#916;Vnr.

         <title>Dielectric Polymer with Designable Large Motion under Low Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions is reported to be actuated under low electric fields (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1). The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This induces a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in&#8208;plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e&#8208;field)&#8208;induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in&#8208;plane actuation is converted into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e&#8208;field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e&#8208;field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) is reported. The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a DE. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.

&lt;p&gt;Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in-plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e-field)-induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in-plane actuation is converted into out-of-plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e-field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e-field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported.

These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Sb2Te3/GeTe Superlattice Film and Its Melt&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Free Phase&#8208;Transition Mechanism for Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ crystallized Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice film is grown by atomic layer deposition on the planar and sidewall memory cell, showing a significantly decreased reset current compared with the homogeneously mixed alloy. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress and effective electromigration of the Ge atoms induce a melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization mechanism.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO2 insulator is demonstrated. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb2Te3 enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of &#8776;1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)&#8208;oriented face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress, induced by the SL&#8208;to&#8208;FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement. Set operation switches the amorphous to the (111)&#8208;oriented FCC structure.

         <title>Polymeric Single&#8208;Ion Conductors with Enhanced Side&#8208;Chain Motion for High&#8208;Performance Solid Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC) based on heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers high ionic conductivity with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number, leading to high&#8208;performance solid zinc batteries.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have enormous potential in realizing high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC)&#8208;based SPEs can largely eradicate anion migration and side reactions of electrodes with decreased polarization, but the ionic conductivity is still unsatisfactory due to the tight localized ion interactions and sluggish chain motion. Herein, by employing the heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain, a novel PSIC is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers an ionic conductivity up to 5.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number of 0.94. Based on the PSIC, dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping cycling (2000&#160;h) is achieved. A further assembled Zn&#8214;V2O5 battery exhibits superior performances to other solid ZIBs, including a high discharge capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life. In addition, a remarkable shelf&#8208;life (90 d), low self&#8208;discharge rate, and good temperature adaptability of the solid battery can be achieved benefiting from the high stability of the SPE during operation. The PSIC&#8208;based SPEs with advanced ion&#8208;transport structure endow solid ZIBs with significant performance improvement, high safety, and durability.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Boosted Imine Cathodes with Extended Conjugated Structure for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been the spotlight in energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety, fast kinetics, and low cost. In this work, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated structure is in situ injected into layered Ti&#8208;based MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. The assembled ZIBs exhibit ultralong cycle stability and display impressive potential for electronic devices.








Abstract
Organic molecules have been considered promising energy&#8208;storage materials in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but are plagued by poor conductivity and structural instability because of the short&#8208;range conjugated structure and low molecular weight. Herein, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated effects along the C&#63742;N backbones is proposed, which is in situ injected into layered MXene to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. Theoretical and electrochemical analyses reveal a selective H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism in TAP, which is ascribed to the steric effect on the availability of active C&#63742;N sites. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx, as a conductive scaffold, favors fast Zn2+ diffusion to boost the electrode kinetics of TAP. Close electronic interactions between TAP and Ti3C2Tx preserve the structural integrity of TAP/Ti3C2Tx during the repeated charge/discharge. Accordingly, the TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 303 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.04 A g&#8722;1 in aqueous ZIBs, which also realizes an ultralong lifetime over 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 81.6%. Furthermore, flexible Zn||TAP/Ti3C2Tx batteries with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrate potential application in wearable electronic devices. This work offers pivotal guidance to create highly stable organic electrodes for advanced ZIBs.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced organic synapse with single&#8208;polarity presynaptic voltage driven facilitation and depression is reported. The device is controlled by the coupling effect in a polyelectrolyte&#8208;electret bilayer. It produces synaptic facilitation by electrochemical doping and depression by electret&#8208;charging. As a result, the device outperforms conventional organic electrochemical synapses with simplified operations and sophisticated functionality.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decade electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.

To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical-electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation-to-depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold-controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude-dependent, dual-modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulate Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized two&#8208;enzyme nanoparticles are constructed using GOx, Mn2+, and HA (GOx&#8208;Mn/HA). GOx&#8208;Mn/HA can target the tumor site and, self&#8208;amplifying, regulate the tumor glycometabolism to cause tumor cell pyroptosis and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression. GOx&#8208;Mn/HA is further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to treat tumors, which can effectively inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. In this work,&#160;regulating tumor glycometabolism is found to induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy is investigated here. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method is used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It has the ability to self&#8208;amplify regulation of the glycometabolism of tumor cells. It can also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, nanoparticles are further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibits tumor development and significantly increases &#160;the survival time of mice. Combination therapy also has a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This is thought to be the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immunocheckpoint blocking in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy can have good prospects in clinical applications.

         <title>In situ Observation of Structural Evolution and Phase Engineering of Amorphous Materials during Crystal Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation from the amorphous phase is probed at the atomic scale through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. Three distinct stages, including aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals, are observed. Unconventional crystal phases, e.g., fcc Ru, hcp Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo, are formed through nucleation from the corresponding amorphous C&#8208;doped metal nanosheets.








Abstract
The nucleation pathway determines the structures and thus properties of formed nanomaterials, which is governed by the free energy of the intermediate phase during nucleation. The amorphous structure, as one of the intermediate phases during nucleation, plays an important role in modulating the nucleation pathway. However, the process and mechanism of crystal nucleation from amorphous structures still need to be fully investigated. Here, in situ aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) is employed to conduct real&#8208;time imaging of the nucleation of ultrathin amorphous nanosheets (NSs). The results indicate that their nucleation contains three distinct stages, i.e., aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals. In particular, the crystallization processes of various amorphous materials are investigated systematically to form corresponding nanocrystals with unconventional crystalline phases, including face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) Ru, hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo alloy. In situ electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis unveils that the doped carbon in the original amorphous NSs can migrate to the surface during the nucleation process, stabilizing the obtained unconventional crystal phases transformed from the amorphous structures, which is also proven by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of using preexisting polymer chains to fabricate hydrogels from doughs is reported. The dough is formed by mixing the polymers with water and photoinitiator. Kneading and annealing then homogenize the dough and entangle the polymers. The polymers are crosslinked and swollen in water to equilibrium. Such a hydrogel resolves the conflict between swell&#8208;resistance and toughness, while having near&#8208;perfect elasticity.








Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with two widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Multifunctional 4D&#8208;Printed Sperm&#8208;Hybrid Microcarriers for Assisted Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D&#8208;printed microcarriers are developed to perform various functions, including multiple sperm cargo&#8208;release, local sperm capacitation, and mediation of cumulus&#8211;oocyte complex removal by in situ enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Remotely controllable microrobots are appealing for various biomedical in vivo applications. In particular, in recent years, our&#160;group has focused on developing sperm&#8208;microcarriers to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies or low sperm count (two of the most prominent male infertility problems) to reach the oocyte toward in&#8208;vivo&#8208;assisted fertilization. Different sperm carriers, considering their motion in realistic media and confined environments, have been optimized. However, the already&#8208;reported sperm carriers have been mainly designed to transport single sperm cell, with limited functionality. Thus, to take a step forward, here, the development of a 4D&#8208;printed multifunctional microcarrier containing soft and smart materials is reported. These microcarriers can not only transport and deliver multiple motile sperm cells, but also release heparin and mediate local enzymatic reactions by hyaluronidase&#8208;loaded polymersomes (HYAL&#8208;Psomes). These multifunctional facets enable in situ sperm capacitation/hyperactivation, and the local degradation of the cumulus complex that surrounds the oocyte, both to facilitate the sperm&#8211;oocyte interaction for the ultimate goal of in vivo assisted fertilization.

A spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (NTAs) photoanode is developed for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The superiority of the co&#8208;edged FeO6 octahedral structure in the Formox process is demonstrated. Impressively, the heterostructure and the interfacial effect of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 and CoFe2O4 facilitates the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, resulting in superior PEC methanol conversion efficiency and formaldehyde selectivity.








Abstract
The interaction mechanism between the reacting species and the active site of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;based photoanodes in photoelectrochemical methanol conversion reaction is still ambiguous. Herein, a simple two&#8208;step strategy is demonstrated to fabricate a porous &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 heterojunction for the methanol conversion reaction. The influence of the electronic structure of active site and interfacial effect on the reaction are investigated by constructing two different FeO6 octahedral configurations and heterogeneous structures. The optimal sample ZnFeCo&#8208;2 affords high photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 3.2 times than that of ZnFe (0.37 mA cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the ZnFeCo&#8208;2 also exhibits 97.8% Faraday efficiency of CH3OH to HCHO, and long&#8208;term stability over 40 h. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the heterostructured &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 with favorable electron transfer effectively lowers methanol adsorption, C&#8211;H bond activation, and HCHO desorption energy relative to the pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, resulting in excellent methanol conversion efficiency.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are developed by designing a new series of polymer donors (PDs, PhAm) featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable flexible spacers. High power conversion efficiency (PCE = 12.7%) and stretchability (PCE retention of &gt; 80% at 32% strain) are demonstrated, which represent the best performances in terms of both PCE and stretchability among the IS&#8208;OSCs reported to date.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (N1,N3&#8208;bis((5&#8208;bromothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)isophthalamide, PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions is developed. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention of &gt;80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. It is also found that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

Organic Solar Cells
In article number 2207544, Jung&#8208;Yong Lee, Bumjoon J. Kim, and co&#8208;workers report the development of efficient and intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), by designing new polymer donors featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable spacers. The use of the new polymer donors significantly enhances the stretchability of the active layers, and the resulting IS&#8208;OSCs, maintain 86% of the initial efficiency after 100 cycles of stretching/releasing under 15% strain.

Methanol Oxidation Reaction
To investigate the mechanism of the  coedge/coplanar FeO6 structure for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube array structures are designed by Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu and co&#8208;workers, as reported in article number 2208438. Benefiting from the special electronic structure of the coedge active FeO6 site and the interfacial effect of the heterojunction, the obtained CoFe2O4/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 demonstrates favorable performance for the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde.

         <title>Stabilization of Perovskite Solar Cells: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The roles of electrode materials and interfaces in perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices are discussed&#160;in terms of perovskite stability. The various factors responsible for rapid degradation in PSCs are provided. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials for carbon&#8208;based PSC as a substitute for noble metals are addressed, along with the recent progress.








Abstract
Exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved, which is comparable with their traditional rivals (Si&#8208;based solar cells). However, commercialization&#8208;worthy efficiency and long&#8208;term stability remain a challenge. In this regard, there are increasing studies focusing on the interface engineering in PSC devices to overcome their poor technical readiness. Herein, the roles of electrode materials and interfaces in PSCs are discussed in terms of their PCEs and perovskite stability. All the current knowledge on the factors responsible for the rapid intrinsic and external degradation of PSCs is presented. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials as substitutes for noble metals are focused on, along with the recent research progress in carbon&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a sub&#8208;category of PSCs, that is, flexible PSCs, is considered as a type of exceptional power source due to their high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and figures of merit for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. Last, the future perspectives and directions for research in PSCs are discussed, with an emphasis on their commercialization.

         <title>Understanding of Oxygen Redox in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of oxygen redox in lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. Meanwhile, the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction on metal oxides is interpreted and perspectives on the future development of LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often either proceeds solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike the AEM, the LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen (O&#63743;O) bond. As a result, such a process is able to bypass the rate&#8208;determining step, that is, O&#63743;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM&#8208;based catalysts are able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM&#8208;based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;Thick 2D Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to print arrays of atomic&#8208;thick semiconducting thin films is demonstrated, which enables printed devices with micrometer&#8208;scale resolution, high density, and attractive performance, thus paving the way for practical large&#8208;area application of 2D crystals in electronic devices at an affordable cost.








Abstract
2D semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum&#8208;metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy is demonstrated utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 at 25&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, 2D transistors are printed with a density of &#8776;47&#160;000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provides a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Partially Solvating Diluent for Lithium/Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte employing partially solvating monofluorobenzene as the diluent is developed for Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Benefiting from the stable interphases simultaneously formed on both the anode and cathode, dendrite&#8208;free cycling of lithium&#8208;metal anodes with high Coulombic efficiency and highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells with low lithium&#8208;metal excess have been achieved.








Abstract
The development of Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries requires electrolytes that can form stable electrolyte/electrode interphases simultaneously on lithium&#8208;metal anodes (LMAs) and SPAN cathodes. Herein, a low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (LCILE) employing monofluorobenzene (mFBn) as the diluent is proposed for Li/SPAN cells. Unlike non&#8208;solvating diluents in other LCILEs, mFBn partially solvates Li+, decreasing the coordination between Li+ and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;). In turn, this triggers a more substantial decomposition of FSI&#8722; and consequently results in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in inorganic compounds, which enables a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (99.72%) of LMAs. Meanwhile, a protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), derived mainly from FSI&#8722; and organic cations, is generated on the SPAN cathodes, preventing the dissolution of polysulfides. Benefiting from the robust interphases simultaneously formed on both the electrodes, a highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells for 250 cycles with a capacity retention of 71% is achieved employing the LCILE and only 80% lithium&#8208;metal excess.

         <title>Anharmonic Cation&#8211;Anion Coupling Dynamics Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Sulfide Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By comparing the anharmonic phonon coupling calculations with the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, this study unveils a unique phenomenon in sulfide solid electrolytes in comparison with halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors often show higher Li&#8208;ion conductivity than other types of electrolyte materials. This work unveils a unique Li&#8208;ion conductive behavior in these materials through the perspective of anharmonic coupling assisted Li&#8208;ion diffusion. Li hopping events can happen simultaneously with various types of lattice dynamics, while only a statistically important synchronization of motions may indicate coupling. This method enables a direct evaluation of the coupling strength between these motions, which more fundamentally decides if a specific type of lattice motion is really anharmonically coupled to the Li hopping event and whether the coupling can facilitate the Li diffusion. By a new ab initio computational approach, this work unveils a unique phenomenon in prototype sulfide electrolytes in comparison with typical halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing phonon modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes. The coupling pushes Li ions toward the diffusion channels for reduced diffusion barriers. The result from the lower temperature range (&#8776;0&#8211;300 K) of simulation can also be more relevant to the application of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphocholine&#8208;based Janus dendrimer is reported, which lacks the &#8220;weak points&#8221; that result in the chemical and physical instability of natural liposomes. Despite their synthetic nature, the resulting self&#8208;assembled dendrimersomes recapitulate the most important physical properties of cell membranes. This enables functionalization with natural functional molecules as well as mimicry of cellular functions on a basic level.








Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron is introduced. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information&#8208;storage expansion, and dual&#8208;encryption are realized.








Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information&#8208;storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Design of Smart Aggregates: Toward Rapid Clinical Diagnosis of Hyperlipidemia in Human Blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. They can act as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221; and autonomously respond to HLP to realize in vitro detection and in vivo imaging in mice and human blood. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm).








Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive properties are desired for their wide practical applications such as bioprobes. Here, a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit a twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect in aqueous media, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in highly viscous media due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. These aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures are described, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Bithiophene&#8208;Imide&#8208;Based Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM)&#160;PFBTI is successfully developed for PVSCs. The suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent surface passivation effects endow PFBTI&#8208;based organic/inorganic hybrid PVSCs with a promising PCE of 23.1% and much&#8208;enhanced stability. PFBTI can be further used in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and achieve high PCEs.








Abstract
The development of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability, and comprehensive passivation is significant for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety effectively enhances hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as the HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Photoswitchable Microgels for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light is demonstrated. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light stimulates in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that increases RGD availability, thereby facilitating macrophage adhesion linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization. Visible light induces the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that decreases RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled structures is achieved irreversibly or under non&#8208;physiological conditions, thereby limiting their biomedical, environmental, and catalysis applicability. In this study, microgels composed of azobenzene derivatives stacked via &#960;&#8211;cation and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are developed that are electrostatically stabilized with Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD)&#8208;bearing anionic polymers. Lateral swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels occurs via cis&#8208;azobenzene formation mediated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light, which disrupts intermolecular interactions on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;coated materials. Real&#8208;time imaging and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;azobenzene formation. Near&#8208;infrared light can induce in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to increase RGD availability and trigger release of loaded interleukin&#8208;4, which facilitates the adhesion structure assembly linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages. In contrast, visible light can induce deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to decrease RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization. These microgels exhibit high stability and non&#8208;toxicity. Versatile use of ligands and protein delivery can offer cytocompatible and photoswitchable manipulability of diverse host cells.

         <title>Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributor to self&#8208;regulate/orientate the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level. Remarkably, Na symmetric cells achieve unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities in additive&#8208;free carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource.

&lt;p&gt;This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion-redistributor to self-regulate/orientate the flux of Na-ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic topological materials rely on strong interaction between localized spins and states comprising the topological bands. This interaction is directly interrogated in an intrinsic magnetic topological material, MnBi2Te4, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. It is found that this exchange coupling is &gt;100 times stronger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of &gt;25 meV.








Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, a topological insulator with intrinsic antiferromagnetism. This is achieved by optically exciting Bi&#8208;Te p states comprising the bulk topological bands and interrogating the consequent Mn 3d spin dynamics, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. Ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that the p states demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation, the Mn 3d spins, probed by resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are observed to disorder concurrently with the p spins. Together with atomistic simulations, this reveals that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the surface states. By quantifying this exchange coupling, this study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to manipulate topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Zn&#8211;Air Batteries&#160;with Long Lifetime Enabled by Reconstructed Amorphous Multi&#8208;Metallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air battery&#160;works well at high current densities of 100&#8211;400&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low voltages due to the OER intermediate O* migration from the Ni to the Fe site in a defect&#8208;rich ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide derived by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, helping to break the restriction of the scaling relationship and then resulting in high intrinsic OER activity with a theoretical overpotential of 170&#8201;mV.








Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries is crucial for widening their application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100, and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, is developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8&#160;mAh (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8211;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8722;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi&#8208;active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of the pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule&#8208;based engines with a quantum advantage are implemented using spin electronics to harvest the most basic form of energy: ambient heat. This ground&#8208;breaking interdisciplinary approach enables electrical output above room temperature using nanoscale electrical devices. This opens quantum technologies and spintronics toward disruptive energy applications, as a possible technological game&#8208;changer to help mitigate the energy/climate crises.








Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous is proposed. The spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co center of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron&#8208;spin&#8208;selecting Fe/C60 interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C60 interface are measured. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built&#8208;in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic&#8208;based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide/Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>

A graphene oxide/porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO/PG/GO) membrane separation technology by pressure&#8208;driven filtration is reported and it is applied in isotope separation at room temperature. It shows&#160;an excellent structural, long&#8208;term stability, ultralow energy consumption, and ultrahigh selectivity for deuterium water, including rejection rate of &#8776;97%, the selectivity of &#8776;35.2 as well.








Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is a strategic material that is widely used in and scientific research and has applications in fields such as nuclear energy generation. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room&#8208;temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores are sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25&#160;&#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O is &#8776;97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O is &#8776;35.2, and the excellent performance can be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water is successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage, and the membrane exhibits excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method does not require ultralow temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Textured perovskite films are formed artificially by controlling the dwell time of the antisolvent. Due to scattering at the textured surface, photons trapped in the waveguide mode can be extracted. Therefore, the external quantum efficiency is boosted significantly from 10% for flat perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to 20.5% for textured PeLEDs with an extraordinarily thick perovskite layer of 1.5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs is reported. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film&#8208;forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nm, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 &#181;m. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 &#181;m. This study provides a novel way of forming light&#8208;extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;Doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high sonodynamic therapy efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.








Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, resulting in redshifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, it is found that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs (nanoparticles of BAnTh&#160;and BTeTh) shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell Toward Superior Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ is modified by 2&#8208;propanol to form a eutectic solvation shell, which can promote the oriented deposition of Zn metal and great desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. Attributed to its new outer solvation structure design, fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling capability of Zn&#8208;ion batteries under extreme temperature operation condition are achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among a next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, it is demonstrated that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500&#160;h under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance is achieved in a 150&#160;mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

         <title>Spontaneous Interface Healing by a Dynamic Liquid&#8208;Crystal Transition for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) molecules interacting with PbI2 retard the crystallization of the perovskite film, and finally increase the grain size. During annealing, the LC molecules undergo a phase transition, and then the flowable LC is extracted by the lower interface to release the residual stress, and accelerate electron extraction.

Low&#8208;temperature solution processing of thin&#8208;film semiconductors is more cost&#8208;effective than traditional vacuum processing; however, it leads to more defects during fast bulk crystallization and residual tensile stress. Herein, a new strategy of dynamic liquid&#8208;crystal transition (DLCT) is developed to solve these problems in one step. The design principle is used to suggest that the DLCT molecule should firstly interact with the perovskite grains in the bulk and meanwhile go through a dynamic transition to spontaneously heal the interface. A thermotropic LC molecule (CBO6SS6OCB) is then designed to demonstrate the strategy. The LC interacting with perovskite colloid forms an intermediate adduct to retard the crystallization. The annealing processes stimulate the concentrated LC solid, causing it to flow to the electron transport layer to release the residual stress to attain improved electron extraction. Consequently, the device efficiency is increased to 24.38%, where its VOC of 1.184&#160;V is among the best for the formamidine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the ambient stability (93.0% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of aging) and light stability (96.3% of initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of aging) are much improved. This work conceives a new engineering of additive phase transition for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

&lt;p&gt;Liquid-crystal (LC) molecules interacting with PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; retard the crystallization of the perovskite film, and finally increase the grain size. During annealing, the LC molecules undergo a phase transition, and then the flowable LC is extracted by the lower interface to release the residual stress, and accelerate electron extraction. A new engineering of additive phase transition is thus conceived.

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on a Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrode with tailor&#8208;made hierarchical pores spanning from nanometer to millimeter scale is fabricated by in&#160;situ growth vertically aligned covalent organic framework nanoplatelets on graphene aerogel. This electrode exhibits an integration of high energy density and high power density as well as good cyclic stability in flexible supercapacitor devices.








Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#181;m is reported. Vertically aligned 2D covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm are in&#160;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5&#160;to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2&#160;to 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Simultaneously Stabilizing Both Electrodes and Electrolytes by a Self&#8208;Separating Organometallics Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries at Wide Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aid of electrochemical evolution of an organometallic compound, a self&#8208;separating interface layer for Zn anodes is designed, which can promote the electrode and electrolyte stability simultaneously. The interface with a polymeric C4N3 skeleton and cations homogenizes the Zn2+ flux, induces planar deposition, and maintain cathode stability, leading to high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long&#8208;term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self&#8208;separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon&#8208;enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc&#8208;ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface and sodium ions&#8217; equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000&#160;h and rate performance at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self&#8208;separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles from &#8722;35 to 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with an Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to construct superactive engines for self&#8208;propulsion of nanomotors under physiological concentration of H2O2. The PtPdMo ternary alloy induced by plasma improves the catalytic activity of the Pt&#8208;based engine, thus promoting movement both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously achieves nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy in traumatic&#8208;brain&#8208;injury mice.








Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing a feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. Herein, Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half&#8208;coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt&#8208;based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first&#8208;aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible gallium&#8208;based antifungal strategy (MLPGa), integrating lyticase and Ga ions, is&#160;developed for effective fungal keratitis treatment, which can degrade the permeation barrier of exopolysaccharides, then eradicate Candida albicans and biofilms through the mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharide degradation, intrinsic reactive oxygen production, and metabolic interference under Raman/PA bimodal imaging monitors.








Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in the fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) are presented that can degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both planktonic Candida albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron&#8208;ion&#8208;utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm&#8208;development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between the nanosystems and the gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

&lt;p&gt;A biocompatible gallium-based antifungal strategy (MLPGa), integrating lyticase and Ga ions, is&#160;developed for effective fungal keratitis treatment, which can degrade the permeation barrier of exopolysaccharides, then eradicate &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; and biofilms through the mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharide degradation, intrinsic reactive oxygen production, and metabolic interference under Raman/PA bimodal imaging monitors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in the fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, lyticase and gallium ions co-integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) are presented that can degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both planktonic &lt;i&gt;Candida albicans&lt;/i&gt; and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic interference of antioxidant-related genes, exopolysaccharide-related genes, iron-ion-utilization-related genes, fungal/biofilm-development-related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between the nanosystems and the gallium ions provide a real-time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa-based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed SnOCl ternary tin (II) alloy as hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells is reported, which results in efficiencies of 23.2% and 26.3% for Sn&#8211;Pb single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, respectively. Greatly enhanced light stabilities with T87 of &gt;1200 h and 85 &#176;C thermal stability with T85 of &gt;1500 h are achieved by using the SnOCl HTM.








Abstract
Tin&#8211;lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl is reported as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. The solution&#8208;processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that not only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#181;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1200&#160;h, and keeps 85% efficiency under 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 1500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improves the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multicomponent metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8211;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst (IrW&#8208;WO3/KIT&#8208;6) containing only 1&#160;wt% Ir is synthesized for efficient catalytic reduction of NO by CO to N2 under O2&#8208;containing conditions. This catalyst consists of ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6) supported with WO3 nanoparticles, and the latter is covered with atomic&#8208;dispersed IrW intermetallics.








Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here, a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1&#160;wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enables complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and has a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possesses a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Spectral Indicators of Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven classifier of band topology for a database of over 10&#160;000 compounds using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) features as input, achieving over 90% accuracy is developed. By leveraging the simplicity and versatility of XAS, this classifier has the potential to accelerate the discovery and screening of a much broader category of candidate topological materials.








Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials&#8217; topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms&#8217; local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10&#160;000 inorganic materials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively is leveraged. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase&#160;transitions.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles with SHP2 High Expression Promote Mitophagy for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2) is developed. MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation, accompanied by rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, a platform for AD therapy is developed using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV&#8208;engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.

The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC-EVs-SHP2 is demonstrated in AD-mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC-EVs-SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage-mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV-engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;Sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germanium oxide can function as a modifier of zeolite crystallization counter to its conventional role as a heteroatom. This effect is observed for two zeolite frameworks wherein GeO2&#160;addition promotes the formation of nano&#8208;sized crystals. Catalytic tests reveal significant enhancement in their performance, suggesting this method can be a commercially viable route to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites.








Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide (GeO2), to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultrasmall dimensions. This effect is observed for zeolites ZSM&#8208;11&#160;and ZSM&#8208;5 over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2&#160;in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2&#160;recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2&#160;compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid Electrolytes Induced by Growth of Internal Lithium Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphysics simulation presents electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte caused by internal electroplating of lithium (Li) through visualizing local stress, damage accumulation, and crack propagation. The results show that geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the solid electrolyte are critical factors dominating degradation of solid electrolytes, providing novel insights for design of future solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to mechanical degradation of the electrolyte and even short circuit of the cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercialization of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical phenomenon is hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields inside the solid electrolyte. Here, a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate evolution of the mechanical failure of the solid electrolyte induced by the internal growth of Li is reported. Visualization of local stress, damage, and crack propagation within the solid electrolyte enables examination of factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the&#160;electrolyte. Relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur in the region of the electrolyte/Li interface having great fluctuations. A high number density of Li filaments or voids triggers integration of damage and crack networks by enhanced propagation. This model is built on coupling of mechanical and electrochemical processes for internal plating of Li, revealing evolution of multiphysical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. Understanding mechanical degradation of solid electrolytes with the presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolytes for future solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cascade Responsive Nanoparticles Enhance Pancreatic Cancer Therapy by Eliminating Tumor&#8208;Resident Intracellular Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticles, consisting of a hyaluronic acid shell and a core assembled by an antibacterial polymer, are proposed. The nanoparticles sequentially trigger active tumor targeting, deep tumor penetration, efficient killing of intratumoral bacteria, and controlled drug release. The nanoparticles augment anticancer efficacy by eliminating tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria via non&#8208;antibiotic therapy.








Abstract
The limited drug penetration and robust bacteria&#8208;mediated drug inactivation in pancreatic cancer result in the failure of chemotherapy. To fight against these issues, a dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticle (sNP@G/IR) that can sequentially trigger deep penetration, killing of intratumor bacteria, and controlled release of chemo&#8208;drug, is reported. sNP@G/IR consists of a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;core (NP@G/IR), that encapsulates gemcitabine (Gem) and photothermal agent (IR1048). The polymer core, as an antibiotic alternative, is tailored to exert optimal antibacterial activity and selectivity. sNP@G/IR actively homes in on the tumor due to the CD44 targeting of the HA shell, which is subsequently degraded by the hyaluronidase in the extracellular matrix. The resultant NP@G/IR in decreased size and reversed charge facilitates deep tumor penetration. After cellular endocytosis, the exposed guanidine on NP@G/IR kills intracellular bacteria through disrupting cell membranes. Intracellular GSH further triggers the controlled release of the&#160;cargo. Thus, the protected Gem eventually induces cell apoptosis. Under laser irradiation, the hyperthermia of IR1048 helps further elimination of tumors and bacteria. Moreover, sNP@G/IR activates immune response, thereby reinforcing anticancer capacity. Therefore, this dual&#8208;cascade responsive sNP@G/IR eliminates tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria and augments drug delivery efficacy, providing a new avenue for improving cancer therapy.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.








Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through&#160;covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky&#8208;end&#8208;coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments&#160;using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18&#160;self&#8208;assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8211;9.32&#160;&#197; are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross&#8208;sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine&#8208;tuned for the self&#8208;assembly of designer nanocages, guest&#8211;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.

Tensegrity Architectures
In article number 2206876, Ruojie Sha and co&#8208;workers develop a structural library of augmented tensegrity architectures based on geometric expansion of triangular tiles. The highly asymmetric structure highlighted in the crystal lattice contains three linearly independent design axes that lay the foundation for the self&#8208;assembly of designer, heterogenous nanomaterials.

Organic Sonosensitizers
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented by Zhenqi Jiang, Frieder J&#228;kle, Xiaodong Yin, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2206594. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high SDT efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.

Microgels
In article number 2205498, Sehoon Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report the remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light. The microgels are electrostatically stabilized by cationic photoisomers and polyanions. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light using upconversion nanoparticles stimulates in situ swelling of the microgels and release of loaded cytokines, which facilitates pro&#8208;regenerative and anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of macrophages.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relation between morphology&#8211;structure and applications is intricate in covalent organic frameworks. This review highlights the progressive utilization of morphology&#8211;structure design toward the success of various applications. Furthermore, an outlook is put forward for improving the material performance by controlling the morphology&#8211;application design space.








Abstract
Translating the performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano&#8208; to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize, and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology versus application will help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. 2D and 3D frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, the carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. However, the research on COF chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications are provided. In each case, the underlying role of morphology is unveiled. Toward the end, a correlation between morphology and application is provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Catalytic Effects of Electrodes and Electrolytes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Progress and Prospective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with proper catalytic effects are promising in improving the performance of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. To promote the commercialization process of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in the future, the research progress of catalytic effects in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in recent years is reviewed, and the development direction of catalytic effects for next&#8208;generation metal&#8211;sulfur batteries is discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;sulfur (M&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices due to their advantages such as large energy density and the low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8211;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8211;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and, as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with desirable design can catalyze electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8211;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8211;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. The objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8211;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Challenges of Wafer&#8208;Scale Integration of 2D Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Transistor Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

The optimized two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) static random&#8208;access memory designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around structure to 2DMs further improves speed and area density, showing the feasible scaling path beyond the Si technology. The process challenges of 2DM nanosheet field&#8208;effect transistors are also discussed.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of 2D material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness reveals that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibits lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. This simulation predicts that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet (NS) gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduces cell read access time and write time and improves the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM NSFETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM NSFETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, are also discussed.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Pass&#8208;Transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is realized on a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 wafer. Such preliminary integration efforts exhibit a promising future for 2D semiconductors in integrated circuit application.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit&#8208;level optimization. Herein, a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film is successfully synthesized, which is then used to fabricate top&#8208;gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as static random access memory and ring oscillators are examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Precise Layer Control and Electronic State Modulation of a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Phase&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth is effective for synthesizing layer&#8208;controlled and electronic&#8208;state&#8208;modulated MoS2 films. The energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy is efficiently converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film on a wafer scale with excellent uniformity. The number of layers is precisely controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy (a&#8208;MoSxOy) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film. The number of MoS2 layers is readily controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a&#8208;MoSxOy, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb&#8208;inserted MoS2 with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS2 effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.

         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Logic and Ternary Content&#8208;Addressable Memory Based on Complementary Black Phosphorus and Rhenium Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;footprint nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide are demonstrated. A logic inverter with a high gain of over 270 and retention of 1000 s with a Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop feature is demonstrated by using only two transistors. Furthermore, a four&#8208;transistor nvTCAM cell with low processing temperature is realized with a high Rratio of &#8776;103.








Abstract
Hardware realization of in&#8208;memory computing for efficient data&#8208;intensive computation is regarded as a promising paradigm beyond the Moore era. However, to realize such functions, the device structure using traditional Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology is complex with a large footprint. 2D material&#8208;based heterostructures have a unique advantage to build versatile logic functions based on novel heterostructures with simplified device footprint and low power. Here, by adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism between a black phosphorus (BP) channel and a phosphorus oxide (POx) layer, a nonvolatile CMOS logic circuit based on 2D BP and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) with a high voltage gain of &#8776;275 is realized with a persistent hysteresis window. A Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop using only two transistors is also demonstrated, with far fewer transistor numbers than the conventional silicon counterpart, which usually requires six transistors. Furthermore, four&#8208;transistor (4T) nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (nvTCAM) cells are demonstrated with far fewer transistors for parallel data search. The nvTCAM cells exhibit high resistance ratios (Rratio) up to &#8776;103 between match and mismatch states with zero standby power thanks to the nonvolatility of the BP transistors. This back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible nvTCAM shows advantages over other structures with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <title>A Reconfigurable Two&#8208;WSe2&#8208;Transistor Synaptic Cell for Reinforcement Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Power&#8208;Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power&#8208;detector circuits are realized based on MoS2 channel transistors fabricated on flexible polyimide substrates. The work compares the DC and radio&#8208;frequency performance of multilayer and monolayer wafer&#8208;scale grown MoS2 for power detection and shows that both materials allow the fabrication of circuits that work at GHz frequencies with excellent dynamic range and responsivity.








Abstract
The design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated. The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick polyimide film, which, in principle, serves as a flexible substrate. The performances of two chemical vapor deposition MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power&#8208;detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in the Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best&#8208;performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB, outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures show a great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer RC. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect is realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work can provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;Timing&#8208;Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2&#8208;based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy&#160;and area efficient in&#8208;sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here a medium&#8208;scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21&#160;memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D&#160;monolayer MoS2&#160;for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1&#160;&#181;J by the 2D&#8208;memtransistor&#8208;based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in&#8208;sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

2D Transistors
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials have recently attracted great interest in ultra&#8208;scaled chips. The current device structures, contact engineering, and doping methods of 2D TMDC for scaling down and performance optimization are summarized by Xing Wu, He Tian, Tian&#8208;Ling Ren, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201916, who propose the Moore's law of 2D materials and present a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art compilation of the most sophisticated strategies developed to date.

Logic Circuits
Are 2D semiconductors ready for next&#8208;generation IC application? In article number 2202472, Yufeng Xie, Lifeng Bian, Wenzhong Bao, and co&#8208;workers present a wafer&#8208;scale demonstration by circuit&#8208;level fabrication on a 4&#8208;inch MoS2 wafer. While pass&#8208;transistor configuration is more like an expedient to build logic circuits based on n&#8208;type MoS2, future development should add complementary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors to realize more complex ICs.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Microwave Circuits: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene&#8208;based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high&#8208;frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high&#8208;frequency applications.

         <title>Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (FETs) are affected by time&#8208;dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial&#8208;scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.








Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.

         <dc:description>
The developments of circuit&#8208;level memory technologies and in&#8208;memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large&#8208;scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large&#8208;scale 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory, static random&#8208;access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, mostly on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

Recent progress and ongoing challenges for memtransistors are reviewed in the context of neuromorphic computing in solid&#8208;state circuits and systems. Gate&#8208;tunable learning and bio&#8208;realistic functions in multi&#8208;terminal synaptic devices are compared for memtransistors and related floating gate and ferroelectric memories, suggesting opportunities for new architectures that are suitable as hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence algorithms.

Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing of the brain. While non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switches, phase&#8208;change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions has shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi&#8208;terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio&#8208;realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. Herein, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices including dual&#8208;gated floating&#8208;gate memories, dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual&#8208;gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase&#8208;changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer&#8208;scale integration of memtransistors and multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>

The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Compact Modeling Technology for the Simulation of Integrated Circuits Based on Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

The progress made toward the development of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors under DC, transient, AC, and noise analysis, is reported. This includes non&#8208;idealities such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, traps&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi&#8208;static&#8208;effects.

Abstract
The progress made toward the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits is reported. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Another set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which can have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology toward higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers, is provided.
