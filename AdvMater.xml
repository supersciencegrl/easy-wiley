         <title>Hierarchical Co&#8208;Assembly Achieves Shape&#8208;Programmable All&#8208;Boron&#8208;Nitride Monoliths with Excellent Thermophysical Performances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical co&#8208;assembly of physically exfoliated and mechanochemically functionalized boron nitride enables binder&#8208;free, shape&#8208;programmable monoliths. This strategy secures tunable rheology for diverse processing forms while achieving exceptional thermal conductivity and neutron shielding performance, offering a robust solution for thermal management in extreme environments.








ABSTRACT
Despite boron nitride's (BN) exceptional physical performance and durability, the current lack of a systematic methodology for BN processing, which stems from its extreme robustness, often necessitates the use of additive materials, thereby frequently sacrificing its desirable properties. Here, we report binder&#8208;free BN monoliths derived from a suspension with tunable rheology and long&#8208;term colloidal stability. The control of solvent affinity allows the production of two distinct BN morphologies: (1) physically exfoliated, large&#8208;size BN flakes (p&#8208;BN) and (2) mechanochemically produced, small&#8208;size BN particles (m&#8208;BN) with hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized edges. Crucially, the interfacial interactions and aspect ratio complementarity between the two BN components enable spontaneous co&#8208;assembly into a long&#8208;term stable, binder&#8208;free suspension with programmable rheology. The resulting binder&#8208;free BN films exhibit a 19&#8208;fold enhancement in cohesive energy (3.8 J&#183;m&#8722;2 vs. 0.20 J&#183;m&#8722;2 for p&#8208;BN), high in&#8208;plane thermal conductivity (&gt;40.6 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1), and a neutron absorption coefficient of 28.3 cm&#8722;1, offering a promising solution for advanced aerospace, nuclear, and optoelectronic systems operating under severe environmental constraints.

         <title>A Critical Strain Window for Stabilizing Polar Orthorhombic Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Epitaxial Thin Films with Scale&#8208;Free Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical strain window is identified, stabilizing the metastable polar orthorhombic phase in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 epitaxial films. The scale&#8208;free ferroelectric domain walls observed potentially solve the long&#8208;standing reliability issue in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 based memory devices.








ABSTRACT
Ferroelectric (Hf, Zr)O2 (HZO) films are well positioned to revolutionize the next&#8208;generation memories and neuromorphic computing, though metastability of their polar orthorhombic phase remains a daunting challenge. Here, we demonstrate that the phase structure of epitaxial HZO films can be effectively tuned on yttria&#8208;stabilized&#8208;zirconia (YSZ) substrate, resulting in tetragonal, orthorhombic, and monoclinic phases with distinct strain states modulated by film thickness. A critical strain window (+1.16% &lt; &#949;yy
 &lt; +2.30%) is identified to stabilize the polar orthorhombic phase, outside of which tetragonal or monoclinic phase emerges. Tetragonal&#8208;orthorhombic phase transition is observed from lattice relaxation, confirming that the phase structure of HZO is governed by strain. 90&#176; nanoscale domains with interleaved yet atomically sharp domain walls are also revealed, rendering direct experimental evidence for scale&#8208;free ferroelectricity. Our findings not only establish critical conditions for stable polar orthorhombic HZO, but also shed new insight into unconventional scaling of ferroelectric fluorite oxides.

         <title>Poly(Ionic Liquid) Nanofibers Suppress S. aureus Membrane Vesicle&#8208;Induced NETosis to Mitigate Wound and Lung Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered PIL nanofibers selectively adsorb S. aureus membrane vesicles and their virulence factors, suppressing excessive NETosis and vascular leakage, thereby mitigating purulent&#8208;exudative wound injury and fatal lung damage, and establishing a materials&#8208;based clearance strategy for infection control.








ABSTRACT
Staphylococcus aureus membrane vesicles (MVs) cause host injury and excessive inflammation, yet their pathological roles and clearance strategies remain undefined. Guided by molecular dynamics simulations of MV&#8208;polymer interactions, we engineered imidazolium&#8208;based poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) electrospun nanofibers for targeted MV interception. Among multiple formulations, PIL&#8208;C4 demonstrated optimal performance, combining potent antibacterial activity, robust adsorption of methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) MVs and their virulence factors, minimal cytotoxicity, and inhibition of resistance transmission. In vivo, PIL&#8208;C4 attenuated MV&#8208;induced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation (NETosis) and vascular leakage, thereby reducing purulent&#8208;exudative wound injury and preventing systemic organ damage, including fatal lung injury. Notably, DNase&#8208;mediated NET degradation alone failed to rescue MV pathology, underscoring the necessity of direct MV clearance. This study uncovers previously unrecognized NETosis&#8208;driven phenotypes of S. aureus MVs&#8212;local purulent&#8208;exudative wound injury and systemic lethal lung damage&#8212;and establishes a polymer&#8208;based clearance strategy with translational potential for infection control.

         <title>Synergistic Engineering of Molecular Asymmetry and Short Linkers Enables High&#8208;Performance Hole&#8208;Selective Contacts in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzo[c]carbazole phosphonate self&#8208;assembled monolayers with orthogonal variations in bromination symmetry and alkyl linker length reveal a concise interfacial design rule. Asymmetric monobromination combined with a short linker maximizes lateral molecular dipoles, densifies packing, and accelerates hole extraction, enabling inverted perovskite solar cells with 26.24% efficiency and outstanding long&#8208;term operational stability.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) have emerged as highly promising hole&#8208;selective contacts for inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) due to their tunable energy levels and molecular dipoles. However, deriving generalizable rules that explicitly connect halogenation symmetry and linker length to interfacial properties and device performance remains difficult. Herein, we systematically decouple these two variables by synthesizing a series of benzo[c]carbazole&#8208;phosphonate&#8208;based SAMs with orthogonal variations in bromination pattern, comparing asymmetric monobromination with symmetric dibromination, and in alkyl linker length, comparing short with long. We show that asymmetric monobromination is the dominant factor in enhancing the molecular dipole and optimizing energy&#8208;level alignment. It breaks the in&#8208;plane molecular symmetry, generating a substantial lateral dipole that drives optimized antiparallel packing. Furthermore, a short alkyl linker plays a critical role in improving interfacial quality and charge transport kinetics by fostering denser molecular packing, stronger substrate anchoring, and reduced interfacial resistance. When combined, these two design strategies produce a powerful synergistic effect. Consequently, IPSCs incorporating the optimized asymmetric, short&#8208;linker SAM (1Br2PADCB) achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.24% with a high fill factor (FF) of 86.36%, and retain over 80% of their initial efficiency after 800&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking. This work establishes a concise and broadly applicable design rule: asymmetric halogenation with short linkers, providing a clear blueprint for engineering high&#8208;performance buried interfaces in perovskite photovoltaics and beyond.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Defect Dual Management for Achieving Efficient Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells With Certified Efficiency 27.1%</title>

         <dc:description>
A molecular &#8220;ion&#8208;defect dual&#8208;management&#8221; strategy using ABSC is developed for ambient&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells. ABSC simultaneously converts I&#8722; to I3&#8722; in precursor and passivates Pb2+ defects in films, enabling a certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 27.10% and &gt;98% retention after 1000h operation. The approach also supports scalable fabrication of flexible and bifacial modules.








ABSTRACT
Achieving high&#8208;efficiency and durable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under ambient fabrication remains a fundamental challenge due to the coupled instabilities arising from halide redox chemistry and Pb&#8208;related defects. Here, we introduce a molecular &#8220;ion&#8211;defect dual&#8208;management&#8221; strategy using N&#8208;Acetylsulfanilyl Chloride (ABSC) that simultaneously regulates iodide redox species in precursor solutions and passivates electronic imperfections in the crystallized films. ABSC selectively induces the in situ formation of I3&#8722; without FA+ deprotonation, while its multidentate functional groups strongly coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ to suppress deep traps and enhance crystallinity. This synergistic regulation yields air&#8208;processed inverted PSCs with a certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 27.10% and long&#8208;term operational stability retaining over 98% of the initial performance after 1000&#160;h of maximum power point tracking. Importantly, ABSC is fully compatible with vacuum flash&#8208;evaporation, enabling scalable fabrication of large&#8208;area flexible and bifacial modules exceeding 16% efficiency. Our findings establish a mechanistically grounded and industrially relevant route for stabilizing soft ionic lattices, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward practical, high&#8208;performance deployment.

         <title>Perovskite Fluoride Anode Stabilized via Ligand&#8208;Field Engineering for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand&#8208;field engineering regulates the Fe electronic environment in the KFe0.5Mn0.5F3@C anode. This effectively suppresses structural distortion and promotes a robust SEI, achieving an ultra&#8208;long cycle life for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite fluorides (AMF3, A = alkali metal ions; M&#9552;Fe, Mn, etc.) have emerged as promising high&#8208;capacity anode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their practical application is hindered by an intrinsic coupling of structural degradation and interfacial instability, primarily arising from the dynamic evolution of transition&#8208;metal (TM) electronic states during cycling. Conventional extrinsic modification strategies have proven inadequate in addressing this intrinsic limitation. Herein, we propose a universal ligand&#8208;field engineering strategy to intrinsically regulate the TM electronic environment, with KFeF3 employed as a representative model system. Isovalent Mn3+ doping effectively tunes the Fe&#8208;centered ligand field, suppressing Jahn&#8208;Teller distortions and mitigating spin&#8208;state fluctuations. The resulting KFe0.5Mn0.5F3@C composite exhibits outstanding cycling stability, demonstrating negligible capacity decay after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and an unprecedented capacity retention of 94.65% after 1700 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Theoretical calculations further reveal that Mn doping stabilizes a low&#8208;spin Fe state, which mitigates crystal&#8208;field distortions while simultaneously facilitating the formation of a robust LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI). This work offers an electronic&#8208;state&#8208;driven solution to the coupled mechanical&#8208;chemical degradation, thereby establishing ligand&#8208;field regulation as a fundamental design principle for developing advanced conversion&#8208;type electrodes.

         <title>An AI&#8208;embedded, Wearable Dual Closed&#8208;Loop Insulin Delivery System for Precision Diabetes Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable dual closed&#8208;loop drug delivery system for diabetes management is presented, featuring an adaptive, on&#8208;body trained edge AI algorithm for precise insulin delivery, which enhances therapeutic accuracy from 92.10% to 98.82%. 








Abstract
Effective blood glucose management is an increasing demand worldwide. Traditional solutions separate glucose detection and insulin delivery, which is less efficient compared to emerging closed&#8208;loop wearable systems controlled by continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). However, CGM&#8208;controlled systems raise new safety risks, as false CGMs readings can cause insulin overdose, which results in hypoglycemia and fatal consequences. This work proposes a concept of a dual closed&#8208;loop insulin delivery system (DuoLoop) to mitigate the risk issue of CGM&#8208;controlled systems. The first closed&#8208;loop is automated insulin delivery controlled by CGM. The second closed&#8208;loop is the controlled release of glucose&#8208;responsive insulin (GRI), whose release rate depends on actual glucose levels. A customized algorithm is trained and embedded into the wearable CGMs for edge computing. The DuoLoop system shows improved safety in preliminary in vivo test&#160;(longer normoglycemia durations, 98.82% vs 92.10%), encouraging its deployment toward precision diabetes care.

         <title>Vapor&#8208;Flux Growth of c&#8208;BP Single Crystals With Concurrently High Electrical Resistivity and Isotope&#8208;Enhanced High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality cubic boron phosphide (c&#8208;BP) single crystals grown by a vapor&#8211;flux method simultaneously achieve high electrical resistivity and isotope&#8208;enhanced high thermal conductivity, approaching the semi&#8208;insulating regime. Combining record thermal transport with suppressed electrical conduction, c&#8208;BP emerges as a promising platform for solid&#8208;state thermal management and device&#8208;level heat spreading in power and high&#8208;frequency electronics.








ABSTRACT
Cubic boron phosphide (c&#8208;BP) is another class of high thermal conductivity material alongside cubic boron arsenide (c&#8208;BAs) and diamond, as a promising candidate semiconductor for thermal management applications. Here, we report a new vapor&#8208;flux growth method that enables the growth of several mm&#8208;size crystals with significantly reduced defect densities, impurity inclusions, and achieving room temperature resistivity as high as 600&#160;&#937;&#160;cm. The resistivity value is much higher than previous reports and approaches the semi&#8208;insulating regime, a desirable characteristic of semiconductors. Most notably, the isotope&#8208;enriched c&#8208;10BP shows thermal conductivity values that are significantly higher than natural c&#8208;BP and c&#8208;11BP across a wide temperature range. Specifically, at room temperature the corresponding values are &#8776;600&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, 488&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 and 540&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, respectively. This enhancement is attributed to the weaker anharmonic phonon&#8208;phonon interaction in c&#8208;10BP compared to c&#8208;11BP, as explained by first principles calculations.

         <title>Scaling Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Detector Pixels to Subwavelength Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report the pixel&#8208;scaling behavior of carbon nanotube (CNT) film heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) detectors. Scaling the pixel pitch from 5.5 &#181;m to the subwavelength regime (0.65&#955;, &#8764;1.0 &#181;m) improves key performance metrics, yielding a record specific detectivity exceeding 1015 cm&#183;Hz1/2&#183;W&#8722;1 at 1300 nm. Submicron&#8208;pixel CNT HGFET arrays compatible with silicon&#8208;based readout circuits offer a scalable and cost&#8208;effective route to high&#8208;resolution SWIR imaging.








ABSTRACT
Pixel miniaturization is crucial for advancing high&#8208;resolution short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) imaging, particularly for remote sensing, consumer electronics, and portable platforms. However, conventional epitaxial photodiode technologies have been limited to approximately 10&#160;&#181;m pixels, and systematic investigations of pixel miniaturization limits in SWIR detection are lacking. Here, we report the pixel scaling behavior of carbon nanotube (CNT) film heterojunction&#8208;gated field&#8208;effect transistor (HGFET) detectors and demonstrate the feasibility and performance improvement of subwavelength pixel SWIR detectors. Specifically, the main performance indicators of the HGFET detectors consistently improve, particularly the specific detectivity and response speed as the pixel is scaled from 5.5 to 1.0&#160;&#181;m. A HGFET detector with a subwavelength pitch of 0.65&#955; (&#8764;1.0&#160;&#181;m) has a record specific detectivity exceeding 1015 cm&#183;Hz1/2&#183;W&#8722;1 at 1300&#160;nm and rise/fall times of 132/148 &#181;s. Through their compatibility with silicon&#8208;based readout circuits, submicron&#8208;pixel CNT HGFET arrays offer scalable and cost&#8208;effective platforms for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;resolution SWIR imaging systems.

         <title>From Failure to Design: Modulating Phase Transitions and Oxygen Release in Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This table of contents outlines the paradigm shift from conventional suppression to proactive design strategies. It explores how detrimental phase transitions and oxygen release can be precisely engineered into stabilized spinel boundaries and beneficial oxygen vacancies, ultimately constructing advanced cathode materials that reconcile high energy density with long cycle life.








ABSTRACT
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNixCoyMnzO2, x + y + z = 1, x &#8805; 0.8) are among the most promising cathode materials for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs); however, their structural instability during cycling significantly impedes large&#8208;scale commercialization. Conventional approaches have primarily aimed at suppressing phase transitions and oxygen vacancies (OVs), as these have long been regarded as detrimental owing to their close association with voltage decay, capacity fading, and interface degradation. In contrast, this review highlights a paradigm shift from conventional suppression strategies to the controlled utilization of these structural features. Specifically, localized spinel domains facilitate Li+ diffusion and act as stress buffers, whereas well&#8208;regulated oxygen vacancies enhance electrochemical kinetics and structural robustness. We critically examine the dual roles of these structural features and summarize advanced regulation strategies, including doping engineering, surface modification, and innovative synthesis methods, which collectively enable precise manipulation of phase transitions and defect chemistry. Furthermore, we emphasize the integration of in situ/operando characterization, multiscale computational modeling, and machine learning as indispensable tools for guiding the rational design of next&#8208;generation cathodes. Overall, this review establishes a comprehensive framework for transforming conventional failure mechanisms into proactive stabilization strategies, thereby addressing the long&#8208;standing trade&#8208;offs among energy density, cycle life, and safety in Ni&#8208;rich systems.

         <title>Dynamic Polyiodide&#8208;Trapping and Proton&#8208;Capturing Dual&#8208;Network Engineering for High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity, Long&#8208;Cycling and High&#8208;Temperature Zn&#9472;I2 Batteries</title>

Aminonicotinic acid (AMI) enhances the Zn&#8208;I2 battery performance through a dual&#8208;network engineering strategy: the proton&#8208;capturing network enables pH buffering, while the polyiodide&#8208;trapping network mitigates the shuttle effect.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#9472;I2) batteries demonstrate great potential in the large&#8208;scale grid&#8208;scale energy storage. However, severe polyiodide shuttling and interfacial parasitic reactions limit the practical application of aqueous Zn&#9472;I2 batteries with high iodine loading. Here, aminonicotinic acid (AMI) is first introduced in this work to address these issues by dynamic polyiodide&#8208;trapping and proton&#8208;capturing dual&#8208;network engineering. The abundant active sites on AMI effectively trap the I3&#8722; ions for inhibiting the polyiodide dissolution and migration in the electrolyte. Moreover, AMI reversibly captures H+ ions and neutralizes OH&#8722; ions, thereby effectively mitigating pH fluctuations to suppress the interfacial side reaction on the Zn anode. Consequently, the Zn//Zn symmetrical battery demonstrates prolonged cycling stability over 7000 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh cm&#8722;2. The Zn&#9472;I2 battery maintains stable cycling for over 2800 cycles based on an ultrahigh I2 cathode loading of 23.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (3.1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and 3000 cycles at a high temperature of 50&#176;C at 2 A g&#8722;1. This work pioneers a novel electrolyte additive strategy for polyiodide&#8208;trapping and pH&#8208;buffering dual&#8208;network engineering, providing a straightforward and innovative approach toward energy&#8208;dense, endurable, and high&#8208;temperature Zn&#9472;I2 batteries.

         <title>Spectroscopic Performance of CsPbBr3 Perovskite &#947;&#8208;Ray Detectors Despite Grain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Grain boundaries (GBs) typically degrade &#947;&#8208;ray semiconductor performances (e.g., CZT,TlBr), whereas CsPbBr3 remains spectroscopically robust. Detectors fabricated from Bridgman&#8208;grown wafers, with and without GBs, resolve 241Am and 57Co photopeaks at room temperature and show (&#181;&#964;)h &#8776; 10&#8722;3&#8211;10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1. Two&#8208;photon excitation PL microscopy indicates zero&#8208;field impeded transport near GBs, and transients show field&#8208;assisted detrapping. These results highlight CsPbBr3's defect tolerance for functional &#947;&#8208;ray spectroscopy.








ABSTRACT
The CsPbBr3 perovskite has emerged as a promising material for next&#8208;generation &#947;&#8208;ray detection owing to its high stopping power, wide bandgap, and excellent charge&#8208;transport properties. Unlike conventional semiconductors, in which grain boundaries (GBs) degrade response, we observed that CsPbBr3 retains functional spectroscopic performance in their presence, demonstrating remarkable defect tolerance. We systematically investigate the impact of GBs on the performance and stability of CsPbBr3&#8208;based detectors. Detectors containing GBs exhibit measurable spectroscopic performance at room temperature, including resolved photopeaks at 59.5&#160;keV (241Am) and 122&#160;keV (57Co), along with hole mobility&#8208;lifetime products (&#181;&#964;)h on the order of &#8764;10&#8722;4 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1, highlighting the defect&#8208;tolerant nature of CsPbBr3. Two&#8208;photon excitation PL microscopy shows asymmetric carrier diffusion near GBs (under zero field bias), indicative of impeded charge transport, while transient waveform analysis captures field&#8208;assisted detrapping that recovers charge collection on application&#8208;relevant timescales. Our measurements indicate that device engineering choices, pixel placement/size, guard rings, field shaping, and electrode work&#8208;function design can help drift paths and electric fields away from defects, and may reduce GB impacts.

         <title>Heptazine&#8208;Assisted Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitters With Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing for Efficient Solution&#8208;Processed OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
Heptazine&#8208;assisted MR&#8208;TADF emitters enable narrowband yellow emission with high efficiency at high luminance in solution&#8208;processed OLEDs. In doped films, HAP&#8208;3CzBN achieves a record&#8208;fast kRISC of 1.19 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1. The optimized HAP&#8208;3CzBN devices deliver 15.5% EQEmax with negligible roll&#8208;off at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, 11.2% at 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a benchmark 20.3% EQEmax in a trap&#8208;free transport layer configuration. 








ABSTRACT
The development of solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SP&#8208;OLEDs) with narrowband emission, high brightness, and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a series of heptazine&#8208;assisted multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters for high&#8208;performance SP&#8208;OLEDs. By integrating a heptazine core with one to three MR units (tBuCzBN), we synthesized three emitters (HAP&#8208;CzBN, HAP&#8208;2CzBN, and HAP&#8208;3CzBN) exhibiting excellent photoluminescence quantum yields and progressively reduced singlet&#8211;triplet energy gaps (&#916;EST) with increasing MR content. Among these, HAP&#8208;2CzBN and HAP&#8208;3CzBN show green and yellow emission at 537 and 556&#160;nm with small full widths&#160;at half maximum (FWHM) of 43 and 45&#160;nm in toluene, respectively. Notably, both emitters exhibit concentration&#8208; and temperature&#8208;dependent dual emission with TADF behavior in n&#8208;hexane, suggesting potential for optical temperature sensing. In the solid state, HAP&#8208;3CzBN achieves the shortest reported delayed lifetime of 0.92 &#181;s and a record&#8208;high reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate constant of 1.19 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 among MR&#8208;TADF emitters without heavy atoms with long&#8208;wavelength emission. SP&#8208;OLEDs based on HAP&#8208;3CzBN exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 15.5%, negligible roll&#8208;off at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 (EQE1000 = 15.4%), and maintain 11.2% EQE at 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, setting a new benchmark for high brightness MR&#8208;TADF devices via solution processing. An OLED employing a trap&#8208;free transport layer configuration further increases the EQEmax to 20.3%, along with exceptional current efficiencies of 90.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1.

         <title>AI&#8208;Driven Big Data Frameworks for Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interphases in Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rechargeable batteries are vital for electronics, electric vehicles, and grid storage, yet their performance and safety are highly dependent on the complex, poorly understood electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase. As such, this review presents data&#8208;centric frameworks that include high&#8208;throughput experiments, large&#8208;scale computations, and AI&#8208;driven analysis to map interface behavior, guide closed&#8208;loop optimization, and accelerate the design of next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage materials.








ABSTRACT
This review presents a comprehensive perspective on how AI and big data strategies can transform the understanding and design of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphases (EEI) in rechargeable batteries, highlighting their pivotal role in battery performance and longevity. Through uniting high&#8208;throughput experimentation and high&#8208;throughput computation (HTC), which includes automated cell fabrication, advanced characterization, large&#8208;scale HTC screening, and reaction network modeling, diverse datasets can be generated to reveal the mechanistic foundations of interfacial processes. The integration of these datasets with artificial intelligence&#8208;orchestrated workflows and machine learning models, such as closed&#8208;loop optimization and large language model&#8208;assisted hypothesis generation, enables the prediction of interphase behavior, linking molecular&#8208;level EEI understanding and macroscale device performance, and data&#8208;driven discovery of optimal material combinations. Critically, the review identifies persistent challenges, including limited data standardization, a shortage of high&#8208;quality interoperable datasets, the gap between optimization and generalizable understanding, the limits of currently available self&#8208;driving labs, and outlines mitigation strategies for building intelligent, data&#8208;centric frameworks for rational engineering of next&#8208;generation battery systems.

         <title>Observation of Dispersion Anomalies by Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper utilizes negative physical stiffnesses to reveal a new family of dispersion curves with anomalies in both frequency and wavenumber domains. The work not only opens wavenumber bandgaps at zero frequency in passive lattices but also demonstrates such gaps in 2D lattices for the first time. In addition, the authors show the evolution of zero&#8208;frequency BGs into wavenumber BGs accompanied by hidden dualities along the stiffness ratio axis.








ABSTRACT
Band structures encode electronic, optical, and acoustic properties of matter and can serve as an essential tool in material discovery and design. Dispersion anomalies&#8208; sharp, non&#8208;standard features in the frequency&#8208;wavenumber relation&#8208; have been historically correlated with phonon&#8208;electron coupling or long&#8208;range interaction. Here, through a combination of experimental, numerical, and analytical methods, it is shown how magnetic couplings can induce negative stiffness and sculpt dispersion relations to support zero&#8208;frequency phonon anomalies at arbitrary, non&#8208;zero wavenumbers. The approach enables the realization of complete wavenumber bandgaps without time&#8208;modulation, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, or long&#8208;range interactions. The conditions under which non&#8208;differentiable zero&#8208;frequency phonons exist away from the high&#8208;symmetry points are identified. The framework generalizes across monoatomic and diatomic lattices, locally resonant metamaterials, non&#8208;local systems, as well as higher dimensional crystals. In addition, the first&#8208; passive or active&#8208; experimental observation of wavenumber bandgaps in higher dimensions is reported. This work establishes a new paradigm in dispersion engineering and provides means for understanding wave&#8208;matter interaction in both the frequency and wavenumber&#160;domains.

         <title>Spectral Tuning of Hyperbolic Shear Polaritons in Monoclinic Gallium Oxide via Isotopic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spectral tuning of highly directional hyperbolic shear polaritons is realized via isotopic substitution of 16O to 18O in monoclinic &#946;$\beta$&#8208;phase gallium oxide. A red&#8208;shift of almost 40&#160;cm&#8722;1 is experimentally demonstrated with near&#8208;field imaging, corroborated by the permittivity change extracted from far&#8208;field experiments and density functional theory.








ABSTRACT
Hyperbolic phonon polaritons &#8208; hybridized modes arising from the ultrastrong coupling of infrared light to strongly anisotropic lattice vibrations in uniaxial or biaxial polar crystals &#8208; enable to confine light to the nanoscale with low losses and high directionality. In even lower symmetry materials, such as monoclinic &#946;$\beta$&#8208;Ga2O3 (bGO), hyperbolic shear polaritons (HShPs) further enhance the directionality. Yet, HShPs are intrinsically supported only within narrow frequency ranges defined by the phonon frequencies of the host material. Here, we report spectral tuning of HShPs in bGO by isotopic substitution. Employing near&#8208;field optical microscopy to image HShPs in 18O bGO films homoepitaxially grown on a 16O bGO substrate, we demonstrate a spectral redshift of &#8764;$\sim$40&#160;cm&#8722;1 for the 18O bGO, compared to 16O bGO. The technique allows for direct observation and a model&#8208;free estimation of the spectral shift driven by isotopic substitution without the need for knowledge of the dielectric tensor. Complementary far&#8208;field measurements and ab initio calculations &#8208; in good agreement with the near&#8208;field data &#8208; confirm the effectiveness of this estimation. This multifaceted study demonstrates a significant isotopic substitution induced spectral tuning of HShPs into a previously inaccessible frequency range, creating new avenues for technological applications of such highly directional&#160;polaritons.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Induced Ferroelectricity in Charge&#8208;Transfer Supramolecular Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;inspired supramolecular charge&#8208;transfer amphiphiles self&#8208;assemble into nanoribbons in water, where peptide chirality&#8208;induced symmetry breaking generates robust ferroelectricity across multiple systems. These water&#8208;processable organic ferroelectrics also enhance neuronal outgrowth and electrophysiological maturity, offering a versatile strategy for designing functional ferroelectric biomaterials for sustainable electronics and biointerfaces.








ABSTRACT
Organic ferroelectrics are of great interest in sustainable energy conversion, information storage, flexible electronics, and potential biomedical applications as soft implants, among many other applications. Despite their broad potential, the development of organic ferroelectrics has remained limited, with only a few known examples in solid&#8208;state systems, primarily due to the lack of well&#8208;established design strategies compared to inorganic systems. Bio&#8208;inspired supramolecular chemistry offers a path to create functional nanostructures that are water&#8208;processable and biocompatible. We report here on supramolecular charge transfer (CT) systems in which peptides are covalently linked to dyads of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting moieties, creating amphiphiles that self&#8208;assemble into nanoscale ribbons in water. The peptide chirality&#8208;induced symmetry breaking in these crystalline nanostructures not only results in second harmonic activity but also generates ferroelectric behavior across multiple CT systems, demonstrating a versatile supramolecular approach to the design of new organic ferroelectrics. Furthermore, culturing primary neuron cells on coatings of the ferroelectric materials promoted axonal growth and enhanced action potentials, indicating improved neuronal maturity facilitated by the polar structure of the ferroelectric nanomaterials. The supramolecular strategy used here holds promise to create new water&#8208;processable ferroelectric biomaterials, opening avenues for innovative applications in cell charge transfer, neuronal axon growth, peptide symmetry breaking, self&#8208;assembling peptides, supramolecular ferroelectrics proliferation, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Recycling and Upcycling of Polyurethane Thermosets: The Second Life of Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers a comprehensive overview of recent advances in the recycling and upcycling of polyurethane (PU) thermosets. It highlights the recent development of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PU with mechanical recycling, chemical upcycling paths for commodity plastics, synthetic paths for depolymerization and upcycling of PU thermosets, dynamic polymers, and other polymer chemistry advances in chemical recycling. Furthermore, the review discusses future challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable PU thermosets.








ABSTRACT
Polyurethanes (PU) have been widely utilized in various advanced sectors, from insulation, elastomers, adhesives, and coatings to civil engineering materials. However, within the framework of the circular economy and in light of the urgent need to reduce the environmental impact of plastics, technologies have been designed, assessed, and exploited for the recycling and upcycling of discarded PU thermosets, which are chemically crosslinked and difficult to reprocess. This review comprehensively examines the current state of PU thermosets, discusses various recycling technologies, and highlights emerging upcycling strategies that promise to transform low&#8208;value waste into high&#8208;performance products. By also addressing the design of smart PU derivatives featuring reversible covalent and non&#8208;covalent bonds, this paper provides a detailed analysis of how innovative material design can promote a more sustainable and circular life cycle for PU thermosets. Finally, the review offers perspectives on future research directions and industrial implementation of recycled/upcycled PU thermosets, providing readers with some perspectives about the possible future developments.

         <title>Anisotropic Biomass Microfluidics via Directed Moisture Transport and Enhanced Water&#8208;Binding Capacity for High&#8208;Yield Solar&#8208;driven Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports anisotropic biomass&#8208;based hygroscopic aerogels with vertically aligned microfluidic architectures for high&#8208;yield solar&#8208;driven atmospheric water harvesting. Directed moisture transport, enhanced water&#8208;binding capacity, and efficient heat&#8211;mass transfer synergistically enable high moisture uptake and rapid water release. Together with low cost, mechanical robustness, and scalable fabrication, the aerogels demonstrate strong potential for sustainable, decentralized freshwater production.








ABSTRACT
Solar&#8208;driven adsorption&#8211;desorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AD&#8208;AWH) presents a promising strategy for sustainable freshwater production. However, conventional hygroscopic materials typically feature disordered internal architectures, severely hindering vapor diffusion and heat transfer. These structural limitations constrain adsorption kinetics and elevate the energy demand for desorption. Here, we report a biomass&#8208;based hygroscopic aerogel (BHA) with vertically aligned microfluidic channels, fabricated via directional freeze&#8208;drying. This anisotropic architecture enables directed vertical moisture transport combined with radial diffusion into secondary pores, effectively reducing vapor transport tortuosity while simultaneously increasing water&#8208;binding capacity. As a result, the BHA achieves a high&#8208;water uptake of 3.18 g g&#8722;1 at 80% RH and a rapid adsorption rate of 0.25 g g&#8722;1 within 6&#160;h at 30% RH. Upon surface modification with a photothermal ink, the evaporation rate increases to 2.89 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, and the desorption ratio reaches 76.63% under one sun irradiation. Outdoor field tests confirm a high daily water yield of 1.51 L m&#8722;2 day&#8722;1. Furthermore, the incorporation of montmorillonite significantly reinforces the mechanical robustness of the aerogel. This work presents a structurally engineered strategy for optimizing internal fluidic and thermal dynamics in hygroscopic materials, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient pathway for AD&#8208;AWH in water&#8208;stressed regions.

         <title>Operando X&#8208;ray Spectroscopy Study of Pd and Pd&#8211;Au Laterally Condensed Catalysts during Selective Acetylene Hydrogenation: The Role of Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selective hydrogenation of acetylene over laterally condensed Pd and Pd&#8211;Au catalysts (LCCs) was investigated using operando X&#8208;ray absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy in combination with density functional theory. Pd&#8208;LCCs were found to incorporate significantly more carbon into the metal lattice than Pd&#8211;Au LCCs, where the carbon uptake governs the evolution of their chemical and electronic structure, exerting a pronounced influence on catalytic&#160;activity.








ABSTRACT
In this study, near ambient pressure X&#8208;ray photoelectron and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (NAP&#8208;XPS and NAP&#8208;XAS) were performed during the selective acetylene hydrogenation reaction on Pd and Pd&#8208;Au laterally condensed catalysts. The activity and selectivity of this reaction are strongly influenced by the incorporation of carbon into the Pd and Pd&#8211;Au lattice, which is investigated by both experiment and theory. We find that Pd can take up much more carbon than Pd&#8208;Au, which can be used to tune the activity of the catalyst during the hydrogenation reactions. The amount of the carbonaceous species dissolved in the Pd and Pd&#8211;Au lattice was quantified and their effect on the chemical and the electronic structure was tracked by means of operando spectroscopy throughout different stages of the acetylene hydrogenation&#160;reaction.

         <title>CdTe Quantum Dots Encapsulated on Perovskite Grains Enable Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient laser&#8208;assisted localized interfacial engineering strategy that achieves epitaxial&#8208;grade atomic coherence in spatially defined p&#8208;n microscopic heterointerfaces, via precisely embedding p&#8208;type CdTe QDs into an n&#8208;type perovskite matrix, which concurrently establishes dual optimization of microscale carrier management and microstructural integrity, consequently resulting in a new performance benchmark of 26.73% in regular PSCs.








ABSTRACT
Solution&#8208;processed polycrystalline perovskites are inevitably endowed with inherent discontinuity at device heterointerfaces, which creates numerous interface segments that demand deliberate engineering of metastable interfacial configurations. Nevertheless, critical challenge remains in synchronously manipulating interfacial microscale carrier management while maintaining their microstructural integrity under operational stresses. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to fabricate localized microscopic p&#8208;n heterointerfaces with high coherence and ionic bridging through encapsulating well&#8208;defined p&#8208;type CdTe quantum dots (QDs) on n&#8208;type perovskite grains. Surface embeddings of such QDs establish unidirectionally aligned built&#8208;in electric fields that facilitate directional carrier transport across micro&#8208;heterointerfaces while expanding depletion regions to minimize recombination loss. Moreover, CdTe&#8208;induced heteroepitaxial growth yields dislocation&#8208;less interfaces between CdTe and perovskite, simultaneously&#160;passivating accessible defects of iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb2+ at both the surface and grain boundaries, enabling high&#8208;crystallinity perovskite films with robust microstructures. Given these striking merits, a record&#8208;high efficiency of 26.73% (certified 26.02%) with a remarkable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.222 V is achieved, setting a new performance benchmark among regular perovskite solar cells, along with pronounced operational stability with negligible efficiency degradation after nearly 700 h. This work pioneers a transformative laser&#8208;mediated microscopic heterointerface engineering strategy that fundamentally reengineers microstructural carrier management and long&#8208;term durability in advanced optoelectronics.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solution-processed polycrystalline perovskites are inevitably endowed with inherent discontinuity at device heterointerfaces, which creates numerous interface segments that demand deliberate engineering of metastable interfacial configurations. Nevertheless, critical challenge remains in synchronously manipulating interfacial microscale carrier management while maintaining their microstructural integrity under operational stresses. Herein we demonstrate a strategy to fabricate localized microscopic p-n heterointerfaces with high coherence and ionic bridging through encapsulating well-defined p-type CdTe quantum dots (QDs) on n-type perovskite grains. Surface embeddings of such QDs establish unidirectionally aligned built-in electric fields that facilitate directional carrier transport across micro-heterointerfaces while expanding depletion regions to minimize recombination loss. Moreover, CdTe-induced heteroepitaxial growth yields dislocation-less interfaces between CdTe and perovskite, simultaneously&#160;passivating accessible defects of iodine vacancies and undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at both the surface and grain boundaries, enabling high-crystallinity perovskite films with robust microstructures. Given these striking merits, a record-high efficiency of 26.73% (certified 26.02%) with a remarkable open-circuit voltage of 1.222 V is achieved, setting a new performance benchmark among regular perovskite solar cells, along with pronounced operational stability with negligible efficiency degradation after nearly 700 h. This work pioneers a transformative laser-mediated microscopic heterointerface engineering strategy that fundamentally reengineers microstructural carrier management and long-term durability in advanced optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Earthing&#8208;Inspired Nanoparticle&#8208;Filled Nanosheet Arrays for Robust and Efficient Electrochemical Gas Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by earthing&#8208;up, a moderately nanoparticle&#8208;filled nanosheet array is constructed via a confined&#8208;growth phosphorization strategy. Bubble&#8208;induced electrolyte flow reduces electrocatalyst&#8208;bubble adhesion, while embedded nanoparticles strengthen the catalyst&#8208;support interface. This dual interfacial optimization enables high activity and long&#8208;term durability in electrochemical gas evolution reactions, offering a robust and generalizable design for high&#8208;current electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Industrial&#8208;scale gas evolution reactions (GERs) are central to energy conversion and storage technologies, yet are often hindered by catalyst delamination and performance degradation caused by rapid and continuous bubble detachment under high current densities. Inspired by earthing&#8208;up in agriculture, a moderately nanoparticle&#8208;filled nanosheet array architecture is reported, constructed via a phosphorization&#8208;controlled confined&#8208;growth strategy, that achieves dual interfacial optimization through nanoparticle&#8208;nanosheet cooperativity. Experimental and finite element simulations reveal that electrolyte flow induced by bubble destabilization within the nanosheet voids facilitates efficient gas release, thereby reducing electrocatalyst&#8208;bubble interfacial adhesion force. Simultaneously, embedded nanoparticles with larger critical buckling forces enhance the structural rigidity of the nanosheet arrays, significantly strengthening the electrocatalyst&#8208;support interfacial binding force. When applied as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the resulting electrode exhibits a low overpotential of 256&#160;mV at 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains stable operation for 2400&#160;h, which ranks among the best reported for OER electrocatalysts under high&#8208;current densities. Likewise, this design strategy can be universally extended to other GERs, including hydrogen evolution reaction, urea oxidation reaction, and hydrazine oxidation reaction. This work underscores the potential of nanoparticle&#8208;filled nanoarchitectures in optimizing interfacial mechanics and advancing durable, high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for GERs.

         <title>Role of the Recombination Zone in Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the critical role of the recombination zone in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). We highlight that broadening the recombination zone in OLEDs based on emissive layers with balanced charge transport and high photoluminescence quantum yields provides a promising route toward achieving both long operational lifetime and high efficiency.








ABSTRACT
The impact of the recombination zone in organic light&#8208;emitting devices on the device efficiency and stability is discussed. We first summarize the basic idea of the dipole model to describe the optical outcoupling efficiency in planar organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with a thin recombination zone. This model is further compared with the resonance interference effect in weak cavities, showing that maximum device outcoupling can be achieved when the device cavity is close to the condition of constructive interference. Recent developments in understanding the optical outcoupling efficiency for OLEDs with a broad recombination zone are further summarized, pointing out that carrier transport is crucial here. For emissive systems with balanced electron and hole transport, the broadening of the recombination zone has only a minor effect on the optical outcoupling efficiency. However, for emissive systems with inferior electron transport due to trapping effects, the recombination zone is located close to the metallic cathode side, leading to pronounced optical losses. Inverted device structures can reduce optical losses and therefore improve device performance. Based on emissive materials with balanced charge transport, high device efficiency and a long operational lifetime can be simultaneously achieved in OLEDs with a broad recombination zone. Potential research directions related to the recombination zone to achieve efficient and stable organic light&#8208;emitting devices are discussed as well.

         <title>Highly Stable Organic Electrochemical Transistors Based on Cyclopenta Dithiophene and Benzothiadiazole Donor&#8211;Acceptor Copolymer with Optimized Glycol Side Chain Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based on the glycolated cyclopenta dithiophene (gCPDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) donor&#8211;acceptor copolymer is achieved by modulating the glycol side chain length. The copolymer with optimized glycol side chain length (P3gCPDT&#8208;BT) exhibits significantly enhanced oxidation current and ion doping capacity without altering charge delocalization, rending a high &#181;C*; meanwhile the OECT shows high transconductance and exceptional stability.








ABSTRACT
The glycolated cyclopenta dithiophene (gCPDT) and benzothiadiazole (BT) donor&#8211;acceptor copolymers have been synthesized by the method of direct arylation polymerization, and served as highly stable active material of accumulation mode organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). Structure characterization, optical/electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory calculation demonstrate that the glycol side chain length does not have obvious effects on the backbone structure and charge delocalization, but exhibits crucial contribution to the film structural order, oxidation current, and ion doping capacity. The CPDT&#8208;BT copolymer with optimized glycol side chain length (P3gCPDT&#8208;BT) shows the best OECT performances with the normalized peak transconductance of 134.2 &#177; 3.2 S cm&#8722;1, charge carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance, &#181;C* of 479.3 &#177; 11.6 F V&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. The P3gCPDT&#8208;BT is also applied to flexible OECT and shows no signs of degradation when operated for 15&#160;000 pulse cycles at ambient conditions, autoclave sterilization procedure, 2&#160;h of ultrasonic treatment, 500 bending cycles, and 60 days long&#8208;term storage. These performances should pave the way for the practice applications of OECT in the bio&#8208;organic electronic devices.

         <title>Fully&#8208;Printed Optical&#8208;Electric Dual Mode Flexible Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;sensitivity and high&#8208;resolution optical&#8208;electric dual mode flexible sensor was developed through the integration of 2D and 3D printing technologies for human&#8208;machine interface.








ABSTRACT
As a pivotal component of smart home control systems (SHCS), the human&#8208;computer interaction (HCI) interface facilitates human&#8208;home information exchange and control. But contemporary HCI interfaces still harbor substantial security vulnerabilities due to the static and singular nature of the collected information. In this study, we formulate high&#8208;performance ZnS:Mn2+ mechanoluminescence (ML) ink featuring high&#8208;resolution printing capability (around 100&#160;&#181;m) and achieve a stress detection threshold as low as 0.01&#160;MPa. Subsequently, we present an optical&#8208;electric dual&#8208;mode flexible sensor (OEDM&#8208;FS) crafted combining 2D and 3D printing technologies. This sensor integrates a capacitive pressure sensor (CPS) with a ML sensor. It precisely responds to the magnitude and distribution of applied stress through capacitive output and luminescent imaging. The system boasts exceptional stability in stress sensing (signal fluctuation below &#177;0.3% under fatigue testing involving over 10&#160;000 cycles), and it can achieve a very high&#8208;resolution stress spatial distribution up to about 200 micrometers. By amalgamating the ML signals with machine learning algorithms, we can accurately identify stress distribution with distinct characteristics, attaining an impressive accuracy rate of 98.5%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the functionality of this OEDM&#8208;FS as an HCI interface for human recognition and its potential applications within SHCS.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) exhibits poor prognosis and rapid resistance to sorafenib, particularly involving p53 loss and Nrf2 hyperactivation. Here, we employ machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted structure&#8211;activity relationship (SAR) analysis to guide the engineering of a library of 120 degradable ionizable lipids, enabling the rational design of fluorinated aromatic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) optimized for combinatorial RNA delivery. ML&#8208;based feature&#8208;importance analysis prioritizes &#8211;CF3 aromatic tails, and molecular dynamics simulations confirm that these tails enhance RNA binding and nanoparticle stability. The resulting A2T5&#8208;s LNPs, functionalized with lactobionic acid for selective HCC targeting, enable efficient co&#8208;delivery of p53 mRNA and Nrf2 siRNA. This strategy restores ferroptosis and induces apoptosis in sorafenib&#8208;resistant HCC by suppressing SLC7A11, leading to marked tumor inhibition. Our study demonstrates an ML&#8208;assisted LNP optimization strategy, advancing precision RNA therapeutics to overcome resistance in refractory liver cancer.

         <title>Close&#8208;Spaced Sublimation of CdCl2 Enables Uniform CdS Thin Films for Certified 8.08%&#8208;Efficient Sb2S3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A close&#8208;spaced sublimation strategy delivers homogenous CdCl2 vapor treatment of CdS thin films, fully overcoming the inhomogeneity of traditional spin&#8208;coating and annealing method. The CdS thin films featuring conformal substrate coverage significantly enhance charge extraction efficiency and suppress interfacial recombination, yielding a champion Sb2S3 solar cell with a record power conversion efficiency of 8.30% (certified 8.08%).








ABSTRACT
CdCl2 treatment has emerged as a transformative protocol for augmenting the crystallinity and electrical performance of CdS thin films, representing a foundational advancement in the development of high&#8208;efficiency CdTe and Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells. However, the conventional spin&#8208;coating method causes inhomogeneous deposition of CdCl2 on the surface of CdS films, resulting in vastly different CdS(solid)&#8211;CdCl2(solid) and CdS(solid)&#8211;CdCl2(vapor) reaction modes during annealing. This process activates pinhole or crack formation and causes grain inhomogeneity due to the CdS(solid)&#8211;CdCl2(solid) faster reaction rate, deleteriously impacting the device performance through compromised carrier extraction and enhanced interfacial recombination. This study introduces a close&#8208;spaced sublimation (CSS) approach for uniform CdCl2 vapor treatment of CdS films. This methodology disrupts the inhomogeneous growth paradigm, enabling the conformal deposition of ultrathin CdS layers (&#8764;20&#160;nm) on FTO/TiO2 substrates. The optimized CdS thin films demonstrated enhanced charge extraction efficiency and suppressed interfacial recombination&#8212;evidence of improved carrier transport kinetics. Under AM 1.5G illumination, the best Sb2S3 solar cell fabricated through this strategy delivered a record power conversion efficiency of 8.30% (certified 8.08%). The CSS technique, which enables controlled homogeneous crystallization, establishes a paradigm for realizing high&#8208;quality CdS films and is an essential breakthrough for high&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S,Se)3 and CdTe photovoltaic devices.

         <title>Synergistic PtAg Dual&#8208;Atom Sites Boost Photocatalytic Nonoxidative Methyl Activation for Coproduction of 1,2&#8208;Diphenylethane and Hydrogen From Toluene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a PtAg dual&#8208;atom catalyst on CdS for efficient photocatalytic C&#9472;H activation of toluene coupled with H2 production under anaerobic conditions. The synergistic diatomic sites enable a novel dual&#8208;site parallel reaction pathway, which splits the rate&#8208;determining step into two parallel steps with lower energy barriers, significantly boosting reaction kinetics.








ABSTRACT
Photocatalytic nonoxidative methyl activation and subsequent C&#9472;C coupling in the methyl group of arenes offer an attractive strategy for the coproduction of value&#8208;added polycyclic aromatics and hydrogen with 100% atom economy and positive delta Gibbs free energy. However, its application remains constrained by the limited availability of highly active redox sites capable of simultaneously facilitating efficient dehydrogenation oxidation and proton reduction. Herein, a platinum&#8208;silver dual&#8208;atom catalyst (PtAg DAC) anchored on CdS is designed to enable a water&#8208;assisted photocatalytic nonoxidative conversion of toluene to 1,2&#8208;diphenylethane with hydrogen evolution. In situ infrared, ESR, and DFT analyses unveil an atomic&#8208;scale synergy within the PtAg&#8211;Sbridge unit that facilitates C(sp3)&#8211;H cleavage of methyl and formation of key C7H7&#183; radical via a water&#8208;assisted pathway, lowering the overall energy barrier from 3.02 to 1.31&#160;eV. Consequently, the PtAg DAC yields 1,2&#8208;diphenylethane at 32.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 77.35% selectivity, outperforming monometallic counterparts by up to 3.1&#8208;fold. Simultaneously, a hydrogen evolution rate of 89.8&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 was achieved over PtAg DAC, which was 2.1&#8208; and 6.5&#8208;fold higher than Pt and Ag single&#8208;atom catalysts, respectively, resulting in a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion due to positive &#916;G.

         <title>Synthetic Disaggregators Enhance Central&#8208;Peripheral Amyloid&#8208;&#946; Clearance in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xinyi Jiang, Yulin Zhang, and co&#8208;workers report an in situ engineered synthetic A&#946; disaggregator (SAD) delivered to macrophages via neuroprotective DHA&#8208;based lipid nanoparticles (SDLNPs). This work uncovers a dual&#8208;action mechanism of SAD through the synergistic interplay of direct A&#946; disaggregation and enhanced macrophage&#8208;mediated clearance. In sum, these findings establish that the central&#8208;peripheral targeting therapeutic strategy significantly reversed Alzheimer's disease pathology.








ABSTRACT
Pathogenic amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) accumulation defines Alzheimer's disease (AD), directly inflicting neuronal damage and driving chronic neuroinflammation. While both central microglia and peripheral macrophages are critical for A&#946; clearance, their functional impairment in AD inexorably leads to escalating A&#946; burden and disease progression. We here report an in situ engineered synthetic A&#946; disaggregator (SAD) delivered to macrophages via neuroprotective DHA&#8208;based lipid nanoparticles (DLNPs). This platform transcends current therapeutic limitations by not only potently dismantling neurotoxic A&#946; aggregates but also by fundamentally reprogramming peripheral macrophages to enhance A&#946; clearance. Specifically, our results demonstrate that DLNPs effectively reprogram peripheral macrophages to produce and secrete cerebral&#8208;penetrating SAD both in vitro and in vivo. The SAD can promote cerebral A&#946; disaggregation, thereby inhibiting neuroinflammatory pathology progression. Moreover, the DLNPs efficiently reprogram the peripheral macrophages to enhance phagocytosis, further facilitating drainage of A&#946; and reducing cerebral A&#946; accumulation in mouse models. Collectively, these findings uncover a dual&#8208;action mechanism of SAD through the synergistic interplay of direct A&#946; disaggregation and enhanced macrophage&#8208;mediated clearance. In sum, our findings establish that the central&#8208;peripheral targeting therapeutic strategy significantly reversed AD pathology, highlighting the therapeutic potential of mRNA&#8208;based in situ fusion protein in AD treatment.

         <title>Femtosecond Laser Non&#8208;Diffracting&#8208;Beam Lithography via Phase Modulation for Dielectric Metasurface Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The team proposes femtosecond&#8208;laser phase&#8208;modulated non&#8208;diffracting&#8208;beam lithography, which, by superimposing axicon and blazed grating phases, shapes femtosecond beams into quasi&#8208;Bessel non&#8208;diffracting&#8208;beam (over 10 times deeper focus than Gaussian beam), controls deflection to 7 nm, enables maskless lithography via chemical processing of phase&#8208;change voxel metasurfaces, and fabricates 9 nm&#8208;resolution Ge2Sb2Te5 metasurfaces and tunable photonic devices.








ABSTRACT
Dielectric phase&#8208;change metasurfaces enable programmable light control and show great application potential in optoelectronics. However, current technologies are limited by challenges in achieving high&#8208;uniformity, high&#8208;precision fabrication over large areas, as well as selective phase&#8208;state modulation of individual meta&#8208;atoms. To address these challenges, a femtosecond (fs)&#8208;laser phase&#8208;modulated non&#8208;diffracting&#8208;beam lithography (PNDL) technique is proposed. By superimposing axicon and blazed grating phases, the fs&#8208;laser beam is shaped into a quasi&#8208;Bessel non&#8208;diffracting&#8208;beam with a depth of focus over 10 times greater than that of a tightly focused Gaussian beam, thereby reducing the need for refocusing and minimizing focal drift. The dynamic beam deflection during fabrication can be controlled with 7 nm precision. The voxel metasurfaces composed of phase&#8208;change regions are then chemically processed to achieve maskless lithography. PNDL is used to fabricate a tunable Ge2Sb2Te5 metasurface with a structural feature size of 9 nm. Furthermore, multifunctional programmable photonic logic devices are fabricated and modulated, demonstrating high&#8208;precision capabilities. This approach provides a novel paradigm for active metasurface fabrication and modulation, laying the foundation for next&#8208;generation photonic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The team proposes femtosecond-laser phase-modulated non-diffracting-beam lithography, which, by superimposing axicon and blazed grating phases, shapes femtosecond beams into quasi-Bessel non-diffracting-beam (over 10 times deeper focus than Gaussian beam), controls deflection to 7 nm, enables maskless lithography via chemical processing of phase-change voxel metasurfaces, and fabricates 9 nm-resolution Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; metasurfaces and tunable photonic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Dielectric phase-change metasurfaces enable programmable light control and show great application potential in optoelectronics. However, current technologies are limited by challenges in achieving high-uniformity, high-precision fabrication over large areas, as well as selective phase-state modulation of individual meta-atoms. To address these challenges, a femtosecond (fs)-laser phase-modulated non-diffracting-beam lithography (PNDL) technique is proposed.

         <title>Tailoring Sulfide Particle Size for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work highlights the critical role of sulfide particle size in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A precisely controlled sulfide particle distribution fills cathode gaps. Guided by the ratios D50Cathode/D50SE &#8805; 7.3 and 2.0 &#8804; D90Cathode/D90SE &#8804; 3.5, the microstructure ensures excellent interfacial contact, high capacity (&gt;200 mAh/g), superior rate performance, and outstanding cyclability (81.5% retention after 4000 cycles).








ABSTRACT
The precise control of sulfide solid electrolyte (SSE) particle size distribution is crucial for constructing efficient ion&#8208;conducting networks in composite cathodes of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (ASSLBs). This work systematically investigates the effects of key particle size parameters (D10, D50, D90) of Li6PS5Cl SSE on battery performance through controlled mechanical grinding. In this study, the optimal SSE particle size composition enables exceptional electrochemical performance of ASSLB: a high reversible capacity of 202.2 mAh/g at 0.25C, superior rate capability (76% capacity retention of 5C/0.25C), and outstanding cyclability (81.5% and 80% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 3C and 5C, respectively). Microstructural analysis indicates that the optimized SSE particle configuration, when 7.3 &#8804; D50Cathode/D50SSE and 2.0 &#8804; D90Cathode/D90SSE &#8804; 3.5, forms a hierarchical ion&#8208;conducting network. In this configuration, the fine particles of SSE in the composite cathode can effectively fill the cathode gaps, while the medium&#8208;sized particles can provide rapid ion transport channels, resulting in excellent rate performance and reversible capacity. Larger electrolyte particles will lead to insufficient interfacial contact and &#8220;island&#8208;like&#8221; ion transport paths. Additionally, excessively lowering D90 will also result in reduced battery performance (3.5 &#8804; D90C/D90SE). This study provides quantitative guiding principles for SSE particle engineering.

         <title>Understanding and Designing Lithiophilic Alloyed Metal Anodes for Practical Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review establishes a descriptor&#8208;based framework that elucidates lithiophilicity by bridging empirical observations with thermodynamic, kinetic, and electronic&#8208;structure descriptors. Building on this framework, we further outline design and fabrication strategies for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithiophilic alloy metal anodes (LAMAs), thereby accelerating developments toward high&#8208;energy, manufacturable, and durable metal batteries with practical relevance.








ABSTRACT
Lithiophilic alloyed metal anodes (LAMAs) are emerging as a transformative platform for enabling practical Li metal batteries. By harnessing alloy chemistry, LAMAs combine favorable Li nucleation and growth behavior, robust interfacial chemistry, and mechanical integrity, thereby mitigating the long&#8208;standing challenges of manufacturability and cycling stability that have hindered large&#8208;scale deployment of Li metal anodes. Nevertheless, a unifying framework that quantitatively defines lithiophilicity, the central design parameter of LAMAs, remains underdeveloped. This review establishes a descriptor&#8208;based paradigm to systematically elucidate lithiophilicity, bridging empirical observations with thermodynamic, kinetic, and electronic&#8208;structure descriptors, while also addressing the temporal stability of lithiophilic interfaces. Building upon these insights, we critically analyze state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies for designing and fabricating LAMAs, including alloy&#8208;embedded architectures, interfacial engineering approaches, modified current collector substrates, Li&#8208;free anode concepts, and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state configurations. We conclude by outlining key research opportunities and design principles that couple materials chemistry, interfacial science, and scalable manufacturing, aiming to accelerate the rational development of LAMAs for high&#8208;energy, industrially viable Li metal batteries.

         <title>Direct Hydrogen Energy Conversion on Industrial&#8208;Current&#8208;Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, we establish a new intelligent charge regulation strategy for the controllable growth of the GDY/RhOx/NiO heterostructure. Charge distribution modulation across the GDY surface is achieved through differences in p&#8208;d orbital interactions at the interface of GDY/RhOx and GDY/NiO, leading to exceptional alkaline HER performance with ultralow overpotentials and excellent durability for large&#8208;current hydrogen evolution reaction.








ABSTRACT
Realizing efficient hydrogen evolution reaction at an industrial scale and achieving high current density is of great significance for building a sustainable hydrogen energy system and is highly anticipated by both the scientific and industrial communities. The key to achieving this goal lies in developing a transformative catalytic system that can promote rapid and efficient hydrogen production at high current density. In this report, we propose a strategy to regulate the electrochemical environment and activation energy at the atomic level, enabling intelligent control of the surface charge distribution and bringing the p&#8208;band center of carbon active sites closer to the Fermi level, thereby giving rise to a new concept catalytic system of GDY/RhOx/NiO. Both the theoretical and experimental results evidenced the obvious charge redistribution and strong p&#8208;d orbital coupling at the heterointerface, greatly enhancing the spatial charge inhomogeneity and improving the transformative electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution capability under alkaline conditions, with overpotentials of 60 and 67&#160;mV to deliver large current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and robust stability at industrial&#8208;grade current densities for 200 h. This intelligent charge regulation strategy through differential p&#8208;d orbital coupling provides a new direction for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in industrial electrocatalytic processes.

         <dc:description>
Vasculature is indispensable for tissue viability in regenerative medicine.

Abstract
Vasculature plays a crucial role in tissue engineering since it is essential for maintaining tissue viability by efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange as well as waste removal. The creation of biomimetic vascular networks is therefore critical for the development of functional tissue constructs. Sacrificial biofabrication has emerged as an effective method for engineering vascular structures by creating temporary templates that are subsequently removed to form well&#8208;defined vascular channels. In this review, the concept of sacrificial biofabrication is introduced and defined, with a focus on vascularization. Then, a comprehensive overview of the commonly used sacrificial materials based on different types of external stimuli is provided, and the classification and design principles of surrounding materials are briefly introduced. Additionally, various fabrication technologies employed to process sacrificial materials are summarized, and the diverse applications of sacrificial biofabrication in disease models and regenerative medicine are discussed. Finally, the current challenges are highlighted, and the future perspectives for advancing sacrificial biofabrication are explored to address the demand for vasculature manufacturing.

Blue&#8208;emitting electroluminescent quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) face critical challenges that limit their practical application, including short operational lifetimes, low color purity, broad spectral linewidths, and unpredictable transient effects like blinking and positive aging. This review explores the underlying mechanisms behind these challenges, discussing key knowledge gaps that require further investigations, and highlighting recent developments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue QD&#8208;LEDs.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QD&#8208;LEDs) are electroluminescent devices where the emissive layer consists of inorganic colloidal quantum dots. Recent breakthroughs have enabled the development of bright and efficient blue&#8208;emitting QD&#8208;LEDs based on heavy metal&#8208;free compositions. However, challenges remain that hinder their practical application in electroluminescent displays and lighting technologies. The primary obstacle is their limited operational lifetimes which remain significantly below practical requirement standards, especially in comparison to the red&#8208; and green&#8208;emitting QD&#8208;LEDs. Another important issue is the low color purity and broad spectral linewidths of heavy metal&#8208;free blue quantum dot compositions. Additional problems include transient electroluminescent behaviors such as fluorescence intermittency and positive aging effects. This review examines the current understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying these challenges faced by blue QD&#8208;LEDs. Often, contradictory explanations are proposed to account for the same phenomenon. Here, potential interpretations are suggested that may help reconcile the conflicting reports. Recent advances are further examined that have contributed to the development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue QD&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Emerging Atomistic Modeling Catalysts for C&#9472;N Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines C&#8722;N coupling mechanisms, discusses atomic&#8208;level catalysts with multiple active sites (dual&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;nucleus heterogeneous dual&#8208;atom, and dual&#8208;nucleus heteroatomic dual&#8208;atom), highlights characterization and theoretical calculations in C&#8722;N electrocatalysis, identifies future challenges/opportunities, aiming to guide atomic&#8208;level catalyst design for electrochemical C&#8722;N coupling.








Abstract
Electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling for the synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals, such as urea and amides, offers a significant advantage over traditional chemical methods. The latter are characterized by high energy consumption and pollution. However, the complexity of reaction intermediates and competing reactions in electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling leads to low product selectivity. In addition, Faradaic efficiency is typically below 50%. Therefore, studying intermediates and designing catalysts are crucial for improving selectivity. Atomic&#8208;level dispersed catalysts modify the structure and composition around the central metal atoms. This results in higher atomic efficiency and catalytic selectivity. This review systematically examines the C&#9472;N coupling mechanism, from single&#8208;step reactions to intermediate coupling processes. It then discusses the design of atomic&#8208;level catalysts with multiple active sites from three perspectives: 1) dual&#8208;nucleus single&#8208;atom catalyst, 2) dual&#8208;nucleus heterogeneous dual&#8208;atom catalysts, and 3) dual&#8208;nucleus heteroatomic dual&#8208;atom catalyst. Additionally, the review highlights the applications of characterization techniques and theoretical calculations in C&#9472;N electrocatalysis. Finally, it identifies future challenges and opportunities for development in this field. The review aims to provide theoretical guidance for designing atomic&#8208;level catalysts for electrochemical C&#9472;N coupling reactions.

Abstract

However, its efficiency is often hindered by rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;a class of crystalline, porous organic polymers&#8212;offer exceptional potential for photocatalysis owing to their precisely tunable structures and distinctive physicochemical properties, yet their performance remains limited by intrinsic charge recombination. To overcome this limitation, the construction of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions has been proposed as a promising strategy to enhance charge separation while maintaining strong redox capabilities. This review begins by presenting a comprehensive perspective on the development and scientific significance of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. It then systematically summarizes the design principles and synthetic strategies of COFs, followed by an in&#8208;depth discussion of the fabrication methods and principles of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques that enable precise elucidation of charge migration pathways within these heterostructures are highlighted. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of recent applications of COF&#8208;based S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, environmental remediation, hydrogen peroxide production, and others. Finally, current challenges and future perspectives are discussed to inspire continued innovation in the development of high&#8208;performance S&#8208;scheme photocatalytic systems.

         <title>Strong Stabilization of Co Nanoparticles by CeO2&#8208;x Clusters in Inverse CeOx/Co Catalysts for Enhanced CO2 Methanation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse CeOx/Co catalysts are promising new materials for CO2 methanation. Operando spectroscopy reveals that small, reducible CeO2&#8208;x clusters effectively stabilize Co nanoparticles from sintering during H2 reduction and promote CO2 activation at the Co&#8208;CeO2 interface. This leads to abundant metallic Co surface sites and a high coverage of surface carbonyl intermediates, thereby facilitating CH4 formation.








Abstract
Inverse catalysts, where metal oxide species are dispersed over metallic nanoparticles, represent a promising class of materials for accelerating various chemical reactions. However, stabilizing metal nanoparticles with a small amount of oxide clusters remains a significant challenge, as the metallic phase tends to sinter under reaction conditions due to insufficient immobilization. In this study, flame spray pyrolysis is employed to synthesize uniformly sized inverse CeOx/Co catalysts for CO2 methanation (Sabatier reaction). It is found that small, highly reducible CeO2&#8208;x clusters effectively stabilize metallic cobalt nanoparticles, thereby preventing sintering even during hydrogen reduction at 500&#160;&#176;C and during CO2 hydrogenation. Detailed operando characterization demonstrates that this stabilization leads to a high density of metallic Co sites interfaced with CeO2&#8208;x clusters, which facilitates CO2 activation into carbonyl (CO*) intermediates, resulting in significantly enhanced&#160;CH4 formation rates. Notably, an inverse CeOx/Co catalyst containing 20 mol% Ce exhibits a methanation rate an order of magnitude higher than that of a CeO2&#8208;free Co catalyst. These findings highlight the dual role of CeO2&#8208;x clusters in both stabilizing Co nanoparticles and enhancing catalytic performance, offering a robust strategy for improving CO2 hydrogenation performance.

Notably, an inverse CeO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/Co catalyst containing 20 mol% Ce exhibits a methanation rate an order of magnitude higher than that of a CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-free Co catalyst. These findings highlight the dual role of CeO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; clusters in both stabilizing Co nanoparticles and enhancing catalytic performance, offering a robust strategy for improving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Personalized Vaccination of Tumor&#8208;Derived Antigens and STING Agonists for Specific Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Personalized immunotherapy strategy to treat tumors by its own mechanism is achieved through the hydrogel&#8208;integrated delivery of tumor&#8208;derived antigens and STING agonists, which can activate specific antitumor immune responses for prevention and inhibition of tumor growth via promotion of the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and elicitation of tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.








Abstract
Personalized vaccines have shown their promise in cancer immunotherapy, while screening of personalized antigens remains challenging. Herein, a personalized immunotherapy strategy to treat tumors by its own mechanism is reported, which is achieved through the hydrogel&#8208;integrated delivery of tumor&#8208;derived antigens and STING signaling activation. Self&#8208;assembled nanoparticles composed of gallic acid, manganese ions, and mitoxantrone are prepared to induce immunogenic cell death of tumor cells in vitro to release damage&#8208;associated&#8198;molecular&#8198;patterns and autologous antigens. Sodium alginate integrated with the released antigens and STING agonists (i.e., MSA&#8208;2) can be instantaneously cross&#8208;linked with endogenous calcium ions in vivo to form hydrogels upon subcutaneous injection. The hydrogels allow for the controlled release of autologous tumor antigens and agonists to activate specific anti&#8208;tumor immune responses via promotion of the maturation of dendritic cells and elicitation of tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As a result, the in&#8208;situ formation of hydrogel&#8208;based vaccines can prevent homologous tumor progression and inhibit metastatic tumor growth. This work outlines a straightforward and generalized strategy for personalized vaccination to enhance cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Neuroimmune Microenvironment Reprogramming via Immuno&#8208;piezoelectric Transducers for Synergistic Stem Cell Therapy in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer is innovatively developed. This device promotes neural stem cell (NSC) differentiation and maturation via ultrasound&#8208;induced electrical stimulation and it amplifies the therapeutic efficacy of NSC in traumatic brain injury (TBI) by modulating the immune microenvironment. This piezoelectric transducer with &#8220;immune&#8208;neuro&#8221; dual&#8208;modulation functions, combined with NSC, provides a new strategy for nerve regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Secondary traumatic brain injury (TBI) induces a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment that hampers neural stem cells (NSCs) therapy and tissue regeneration. To address this challenge, an immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer have been developed to create an anti&#8208;inflammatory immune microenvironment, deliver wireless electrical stimulation, and facilitate multimodal NSCs therapy. The immuno&#8208;piezoelectric transducer drives the polarization of microglia towards the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype and secretion of anti&#8208;inflammatory cytokines. This modulation significantly reduces the inflammatory response, creating an optimal microenvironment for NSCs survival. Furthermore, the wireless electrical stimulation generated by ultrasound facilitates NSCs differentiation into glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, enhances neurite complexity, upregulates synaptic proteins expression and neural integration in injured regions. The multimodal therapy demonstrates superior outcomes in restoring structural integrity, improving functional, and enhancing behavioral action in TBI rat models. This study integrates piezoelectric with immunomodulation to reprogram the neuroimmune microenvironment, providing novel therapeutic paradigm for brain injury repair.

         <title>A Zero&#8208;Thermal Quenching Flexible Fiber for Visible Cellular Concentration Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional biosensors suffer thermal drift, limiting accuracy. Here, an innovative flexible optical fiber detector incorporating a novel phosphor Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3&#8314; is developed, which exhibits zero thermal quenching (up to 200&#160;&#176;C) at 577 nm. This device achieves stable (&#916;x/y &lt; 0.003) and precise (200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1) HbO2 concentration measurement. This work provides a breakthrough in reusable, temperature&#8208;resistant biosensing technology.








Abstract
The development of stable and precise visible light sources is crucial for advanced cellular analysis, yet current spectrophotometric systems face significant challenges, particularly temperature&#8208;dependent signal drift and decreased measurement accuracy. In this work, a novel yellow&#8208;emitting phosphor Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3+ is developed, which demonstrates exceptional thermal stability with zero&#8208;thermal quenching (ZTQ) up to 200&#160;&#176;C. This remarkable performance is achieved through the strategic manipulation of trap&#8208;assisted thermoluminescence enhancement mechanisms. In addition, a flexible optical detector is developed for oxyhemoglobin (HbO2) concentration testing by incorporating Gd3ScGa4O12: Dy3+ in stretchable elastomer&#8208;based optical fiber. The fabricated device exhibits exceptional photoluminescence stability (near&#8208;zero chromaticity drift, &#916;x/y &lt; 0.003 from 10 to 40&#160;&#176;C), and promising measurement accuracy (200 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1). Tb3+/ Eu3+/ Pr3+ doped Gd3ScGa4O12 is also developed, which all perform favorable thermal stability. This finding not only provides a reliable and reusable cellular concentration detector but also establishes a ZTQ design framework for lanthanide&#8208;doped materials.

         <title>Achieving Enhanced Reversible Anionic Redox Activity in Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides via LiCoMn5 Superstructure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moderate incorporation of Co into LiMn6 mainly produces LiCoMn5 superstructure units in LRLO&#8208;Co10, where highly reversible ARR activity is achieved, and Li3&#8208;O&#8208;LiTM2 coordination is regulated from O(I)&#8208; or/and O(II)&#8208;type coordination to relatively stable Li3&#8208;O(III)&#8208;LiCoMn. With this unique structure, LRLO&#8208;Co10 exhibits a reversible capacity of 259.2 mAh g&#8722;1 after 300 cycles at 1C with a capacity retention of 95.7%.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;rich layered oxide (LRLO) cathode drives the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;based batteries, owing to its ultrahigh capacity contributed from cationic redox and extra oxygen anionic redox reaction (ARR). However, unlocking higher ARR activity without compromising reversibility remains challenging. Herein, a series of LRLO samples with varying Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;Mn compositions is designed to synergistically enhance ARR activity and reversibility. On the one hand, the absence of Co results in suppressed ARR activity for traditional Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 with LiMn6 superstructures, causing inferior O&#8208;related capacity and cycling stability. On the other hand, excessive Co/Mn atomic exchange within the honeycomb structure by forming LiConMn6&#8208;n (n &#8805; 2) units activates more O&#8208;redox capacity for another typical Li1.2Ni0.13Mn0.54Co0.13O2, but induces oxygen instability and low ARR reversibility. Notably, moderate incorporation of Co into LiMn6 mainly produces LiCoMn5 (n = 1) superstructures in Li1.2(Mn0.65Ni0.25Co0.1)0.8O2 (LRLO&#8208;Co10) with Li3&#8208;O&#8208;LiCoMn coordination. This unique structure enables highly reversible ARR activity. Consequently, LRLO&#8208;Co10 exhibits a reversible capacity exceeding 300 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C and retains 95.7% of the initial capacity (271.1 mAh g&#8722;1) after 300 cycles at 1C. These findings provide a valuable insight into compositional optimization and a strategy for achieving high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;rich cathodes.

On the other hand, excessive Co/Mn atomic exchange within the honeycomb structure by forming LiCo&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;6-n&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; &#8805; 2) units activates more O-redox capacity for another typical Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.54&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.13&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, but induces oxygen instability and low ARR reversibility. Notably, moderate incorporation of Co into LiMn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; mainly produces LiCoMn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1) superstructures in Li&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;(Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.65&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LRLO-Co10) with Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-O-LiCoMn coordination. This unique structure enables highly reversible ARR activity. Consequently, LRLO-Co10 exhibits a reversible capacity exceeding 300 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1C and retains 95.7% of the initial capacity (271.1 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) after 300 cycles at 1C. These findings provide a valuable insight into compositional optimization and a strategy for achieving high-capacity Li-rich cathodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrabright and Ultrasmall Chiral Luminescence Pixel Based on Thorned&#8208;Helicoid&#8208;on&#8208;Mirror</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superbright chiral photoluminescence is achieved based on the chiral Purcell enhancement of plasmonic nanocavities made of thorned helicoid&#8208;on&#8208;mirror (THoM). The chiral emission can be tunable through the assembly of achiral dyes in the chiral plasmonic nanocavity, which displays colored chiral images of letters &#8220;P&#8221; and &#8220;L&#8221; through circular polarizers.








Abstract
Achieving highly circularly polarized luminescence has long been a primary objective in the design, synthesis, and application of chiral luminophores. However, a persistent challenge arises from the trade&#8208;off between large luminescence dissymmetry factors (glum) and high luminescence efficiency, resulting in typically mediocre brightness for most chiral emitters and limiting their practical use. While various strategies have been proposed to enhance glum, these values rarely exceed 1.0 and often come at the cost of diminished luminescence intensity. In this article, an extreme nanophotonic approach is employed using thorned helicoid&#8208;on&#8208;mirror (THoM) constructs to generate intense local optical chirality, which is then coupled to achiral dyes with high quantum yields. An efficient coupling is revealed between the strong superchiral near field and the dyes within the chiral nanocavity, which not only produces glum values exceeding 1.0 but also amplifies both excitation and emission processes via a pronounced chiral Purcell effect, leading to ultrahigh brightness in circularly polarized luminescence. By adjusting the dye assembly and its corresponding emission peaks, tunable chiral emission is achieved, demonstrating significant potential for advanced chiral displays and information encryption. Furthermore, this high&#8208;performance chiral emitting system holds promise for on&#8208;chip integration of chiral lasers and chiral single&#8208;photon sources.

         <title>Oriented Crystallization of Perovskite Film via Fluorine&#8208;Containing Hyperbranched Polymer for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorine&#8208;containing hyperbranched polymer is developed to guide oriented crystallization and construct a cross&#8208;linked hydrophobic network, enabling the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with enhanced environmental stability. The resulting devices deliver a PCE of 26.05% (0.04&#160;cm2) and 22.43% (16.1&#160;cm2), while maintaining 97% of their initial efficiency after 1500 h of unencapsulated operation at 50&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskite solar cells have significant potential for large&#8208;scale manufacture, but the production of perovskite film with high crystallinity over large areas remains a major challenge. Here, a fluorine&#8208;containing hyperbranched polymer is shown for meticulous control of the perovskite film crystallization. Synergistic coordination of functional fluorine groups and perovskite species constrains the complex intermediate phases and facilitates the formation of spatially oriented perovskite films with high crystallinity and phase purity. Simultaneously, the thermal radical polymerization during the annealing process creates a cross&#8208;linked hydrophobic network, which enhances resistance to moisture. This results in efficient regular planar perovskite solar cells with a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 26.05% for small devices (active area 0.04 cm2) and 22.43% for large devices (active area 16.1 cm2) under simulated AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm&#8722;2). Moreover, the unencapsulated devices exhibit excellent operating stability, with 97% of initial efficiency remaining at the maximum power point tracking for 1500 h under continuous illumination (one sunlight intensity) at 50&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Octahedral Twisting&#8208;Mediated van der Waals Stacking Induces Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>

Low thermal conductivity (&#954;) is an important physical parameter inherent to all solids, and the quest for intrinsic ultralow&#8208;&#954; solids is one of the key scientific issues. By designing asymmetric units in van der Waals material In2Ge2Se&#8326;, ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.2 W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1) is achieved, demonstrating functional&#8208;unit control over phonon anharmonicity and group velocity. 








Abstract
Low thermal conductivity (&#954;) is an important physical parameter inherent to all solids, and the quest for intrinsic ultralow&#8208;&#954; solids is one of the key scientific issues. Material design based on functional units can achieve control over lattice and phonon dynamics, and it is proposed that asymmetric structural units&#8208;mediated van der Waals stacking can collectively lead to the low thermal conductivity. Herein, a novel van der Waals material In2G2Se&#8326; is reported, in which the distorted InSe&#8326; octahedron forms monolayers in conjunction with Ge2Se&#8326; dimers, which are further stacked along the c&#8208;axis via weak metavalent bonding. The distorted octahedron and van der Waals stacking result in large anharmonicity and ultrasoft acoustic phonon along &#915;&#8211;Z direction, respectively. Consequently, In2Ge2Se6 exhibits ultralow out&#8208;of&#8208;plane thermal conductivity, &#954;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane &#8776;0.2&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1K&#8722;1 at 600 K. This study establishes a model for phonon physics that simultaneously enhances phonon&#8208;phonon scattering and lowers the phonon group velocity, revealing the great potential of functional&#8208;unit&#8208;based material design for low&#8208;&#954; solids.

         <title>Increasing Aromaticity in Selenium&#8208;Embedded Hetero Ring Enables Stable Narrowband Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter for Long&#8208;Lifetime Pure&#8208;Green OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing aromaticity in a series of selenium&#8208;embedded hetero rings stabilizes the emitter while exploits the advantages of heavy atoms effect, which results in narrowband pure&#8208;green OLEDs with high efficiency, reduced roll&#8208;off and long device lifetime.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) that simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, superior efficiency, and extended operational stability remains a significant challenge for thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Herein, a novel molecular architecture is reported that strategically integrates selenium (Se) into a rigid pentagonal aromatic sextet (dibenzoselenophene, DBSe) within a multi&#8208;resonance (MR) framework, addressing the intrinsic limitations of hexagonal Se&#8208;MR systems. The developed molecule DBSe&#8208;BN exhibits a rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate in the order of 106 s&#8722;1 and narrow emission bandwidth of 21&#160;nm, providing persuasive guarantee for high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;green emission. Notably, the DBSe&#8208;BN&#8208;based OLEDs demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 38.8%, suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE1000 = 33.7%), and pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.73). The devices exhibit remarkable operational stability, with greatly prolonged lifetime (LT50) of 1341&#160;h based on binary&#8208;emitting system and 5310&#160;h based on the ternary device, at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

     alt="Increasing Aromaticity in Selenium-Embedded Hetero Ring Enables Stable Narrowband Multi-Resonance TADF Emitter for Long-Lifetime Pure-Green OLEDs"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing aromaticity in a series of selenium-embedded hetero rings stabilizes the emitter while exploits the advantages of heavy atoms effect, which results in narrowband pure-green OLEDs with high efficiency, reduced roll-off and long device lifetime.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of high-performance organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that simultaneously achieve narrowband emission, superior efficiency, and extended operational stability remains a significant challenge for thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) materials. Herein, a novel molecular architecture is reported that strategically integrates selenium (Se) into a rigid pentagonal aromatic sextet (dibenzoselenophene, DBSe) within a multi-resonance (MR) framework, addressing the intrinsic limitations of hexagonal Se-MR systems. The developed molecule DBSe-BN exhibits a rapid reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rate in the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and narrow emission bandwidth of 21&#160;nm, providing persuasive guarantee for high-performance pure-green emission. Notably, the DBSe-BN-based OLEDs demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 38.8%, suppressed efficiency roll-off (EQE&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; = 33.7%), and pure-green emission, characterized by Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.18, 0.73). The devices exhibit remarkable operational stability, with greatly prolonged lifetime (LT&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;) of 1341&#160;h based on binary-emitting system and 5310&#160;h based on the ternary device, at an initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work presents a feasible strategy for gathering high-performance MR-TADF emitters, achieving a multi-dimensional balanced OLED with enhanced FWHM, CIE, EQE, roll-off and lifetime promoted by Se-embedded aromatic sextet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Programmable Liquid&#8208;Metal Electronics
In the Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202506383), Wedyan Babatain and colleagues report a programmable continuous electrowetting strategy to steer gallium&#8208;based liquid metal on graphitic substrates by tuning its electrochemical potential on&#8208;demand. This enables surface&#8208;enabled valves, size&#8208;dependent sorting, and feedback sensing. A two&#8208;layer reconfigurable circuit demonstrates liquid metal as dynamic interconnects for sequential and parallel component activation and healing of broken traces, enabling physical hardware updates.

In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503094), Shengqiang Cai, Yong&#8208;Lae Park, and co&#8208;workers report a bio&#8208;inspired artificial muscle&#8211;tendon complex (MTC) based on liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with embedded liquid&#8208;metal channels, illustrated as an artificial actuator connected to biological muscle in the image. The MTC integrates both actuation and proprioceptive sensing within a single structure, enabling simultaneous efferent actuation and afferent feedback. Mimicking natural musculature through an antagonistic arrangement, the system achieves closed&#8208;loop bidirectional control, demonstrated in robotic finger and gripper applications.

         <title>Confined Dynamic and Static Disorder Realized by Entropy Engineering, a New Path to Excellent High Temperature Energy Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by reviewing the recent research in the field of high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, a new paradigm of achieving superior energy storage performance is proposed through entropy engineering to regulate the dynamic/static disorder in polymers. This new paradigm has good inclusiveness for many previous research results and may have significant implications for in&#8208;depth research in the field of high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage.








Abstract
Polymer&#8208;based capacitors are essential in modern electronics, yet their energy storage performance declines significantly at high temperatures, limiting extreme&#8208;condition applications. Extensive research has been conducted to address this challenge. Since ideal dielectrics are insulators, existing models often empirically summarize conductive behaviors based on inorganic materials. However, the complex aggregated structures of polymers make accurately describing their conduction particularly difficult. This review consolidates previous findings and proposes a novel research paradigm centered on the internal order degree of the polymer system. Grounded in thermodynamic principles and experimental studies on polymer conduction, this framework offers a fresh perspective for understanding the nonlinear conductive behavior under high temperatures and electric fields. It provides critical insights for designing advanced polymer&#8208;based capacitors with superior high&#8208;temperature performance.

         <title>Bridging Scales in Solar&#8208;Driven Water Splitting: Pathways to System Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes advances in photocatalyst design and system integration for solar water splitting. Strategies include bandgap engineering, morphology and facet control, heterostructures, cocatalysts, and external fields. System optimization from reactor to panel assembly is discussed. Efficiency and stability factors are analyzed, with future directions proposed for next&#8208;generation photocatalysts and scalable solar hydrogen systems.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis, which converts and stores solar energy as chemical energy, holds immense potential for promoting sustainable development and achieving carbon neutrality. Solar&#8208;driven water splitting offers an ideal method for storing solar energy, with one of the most promising approaches based on efficient particulate photocatalysts. In recent years, significant progress has been made in particulate photocatalyst&#8208;based water splitting systems, from fundamental scientific research to exploratory practical applications. However, to date, no photocatalytic water splitting system has achieved the efficiency required for practical applications. The development of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts and optimized photocatalytic systems is urgently needed. This review examines the crucial factors limiting the activity of photocatalysts for overall water splitting and summarizes design strategies to enhance photocatalyst performance and overcome these barriers. The design and modification strategies for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts are highlighted, including bandgap regulation, localized surface plasmon resonance, morphology control, crystal facet engineering, heterostructures, cocatalysts, and external&#8208;field association. Additionally, the scalability of using particulate photocatalysts for overall water splitting driven by natural sunlight is discussed. Finally, insights into advanced strategies for improving the performance of particulate photocatalysts are provided, and perspectives on the future development of solar water splitting systems for commercial applications are offered.

         <title>Literature on the Synthesis of Modulator&#8208;Assisted Covalent&#8211;Organic Frameworks (MA&#8208;COFs): A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulators play a pivotal role in steering covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) crystallization by slowing rapid polycondensation and enabling error correction during framework growth. Acting as competitive binders and capping agents, they regulate nucleation, suppress uncontrolled aggregation, and direct anisotropic crystal growth. This modulator&#8208;assisted strategy (MA&#8208;COFs) enhances long&#8208;range order, structural integrity, and tailored porosity compared to unmodulated systems. Residual modulators within COFs can further influence surface chemistry and open avenues for post&#8208;synthetic modification. Thus, modulators emerge as powerful kinetic controllers to bridge the gap between fast reactions and high&#8208;quality crystalline COFs.








Abstract
Covalent&#8211;organic frameworks (COFs) owe their remarkable efficiency and versatility to an array of superior structural attributes, including crystallinity, surface area, crystal size, pore distribution, and stability. Although myriad methods have sought to enhance these traits, a singular breakthrough emerged from our research: the strategic use of a lone modulator that elevates all these properties, yielding high&#8208;quality Modulator&#8208;Assisted COFs (MA&#8208;COFs). By deftly slowing monomer incorporation during synthesis, modulators orchestrate the creation of exquisitely ordered crystalline structures, amplify surface area, and foster larger, more resilient crystal domains. Beyond this, they refine pore distribution and fortify stability, unveiling a suite of extraordinary physical and chemical properties. The careful selection and optimization of modulators prove pivotal, directly shaping COF performance and integrity. This review meticulously explores the transformative influence of modulators in COF synthesis, shedding light on mechanisms that drive structural advancements and pinpointing critical efficacy factors. Such strategic deployment not only revolutionizes COF synthesis but also magnifies its potential across diverse scientific and industrial realms. Ultimately, these insights affirm modulators as essential instruments for sculpting COFs of unmatched performance and durability, charting new paths in catalysis and energy storage.

         <title>Comparative Advances in Sulfide and Halide Electrolytes for Commercialization of All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review compares sulfide&#8208; and halide&#8208;based solid electrolytes for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs), highlighting their ionic conductivity, chemical stability, manufacturability, and compatibility with lithium metal. Sulfides offer higher conductivity, while halides provide enhanced stability and scalability. The study emphasizes hybrid strategies, interfacial design, and material selection to enable safer, high&#8208;performance, and commercially viable next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSBs) outperform lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) in safety, energy density, and thermal stability. Their performance depends on high ionic conductivity, chemical/physical stability, and scalable manufacture of solid electrolytes (SEs). This study compares sulfide&#8208; and halide&#8208;based SEs, two promising next&#8208;generation energy storage options. Soft mechanics permit sulfides with high room&#8208;temperature conductivity, low activation energies, and processability, but high&#8208;voltage cathode instability, moisture sensitivity, and probable hydrogen sulfide (H2S) release. Market prospects are favorable as the industry improves crystallinity and elemental substitution, especially for automotive cells. Chloride&#8208;based halides are more environmentally friendly, have adequate voltage stability, and can be used with oxide cathodes without coatings. Despite traditionally low conductivity, high&#8208;entropy, and oxyhalide chemistries currently reach 10 mS cm&#8722;1, and scalable solvent syntheses and dry processing are driving adoption. Mechanical compliance and the use of rare elements (In, Sc) continue to cause integration and cost issues. Composition, microstructure, synthesis techniques, interfacial behavior, mechanical characteristics, and scalability are evaluated. The findings show sulfides have better conductivity and Li&#8208;metal compatibility, but halides are more stable and manufacturable, recommending hybrid or tailored material selection based on application. Optimizing ASSB systems requires complementary sulfide/chloride utilization due to halides' mechanical constraints.

         <title>Photothermally Powered 3D Microgels Mechanically Regulate Mesenchymal Stem Cells Under Anisotropic Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photothermally powered microgel is designed to mechanically train mesenchymal stem cells using spatially patterned exogenous forces in three&#8208;dimensional (3D)&#160;workspaces. When microgels are activated selectively via photothermal actuation, locally confined tens of nN forces are exerted on cells, triggering osteogenic differentiation in encapsulated cells.








Abstract
Exogenous forces significantly influence mammalian cell behavior, yet current strategies fail to resolve signaling processes between individual cells under conditions that accurately mimic the native microenvironment. This work presents a new cell culture technology capable of applying spatially patterned exogenous forces on individual cells within multicellular clusters encased in three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hydrogel matrices. Photothermally powered 3D microgels containing stem cells and integrated force generators are engineered to investigate intercellular communication under anisotropic forces with excellent spatial resolution (&#8776;1 &#181;m). Varying force patterns, such as uniform compression versus spatially heterogeneous tension, are achieved in 3D by relying on the synergistic effect of plasmonic gold nanorods and thermally responsive co&#8208;polymers under light actuation. The microgels generate 17&#8211;34 nN force locally, which activates mechanically sensitive ion channels in encapsulated cells stimulated with isotropically applied compression and spatially heterogeneous tension in 3D in a selective manner. Spatially patterned exogenous forces trigger F&#8208;actin remodeling, nuclear translocation of Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) and Runt&#8208;related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2)&#160;in encapsulated cells following cyclic stimulation. Sustained application of exogenous forces over three days is sufficient to regulate stem cell fate toward osteogenesis. This technology allows combinatorial studies of biomolecular and biophysical cues in 3D, making it suitable for applications in mechanobiology and bioengineering.

         <title>Virus Enhanced Microrobots for Biofilm Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofilms resist antimicrobials across medicine, industry, and environments. We present virus&#8208;conjugated microrobots synthesized hydrothermally and magnetically actuated. Their motion and viral specificity enable targeted binding, penetration, and delivery, outperforming bare microrobots. This platform achieves rapid, efficient biofilm eradication; future work will optimize design and conjugation for scalable, clinically translatable infection control.








Abstract
Biofilms pose significant challenges in biomedical, industrial, and environmental applications due to their inherent resistance to antimicrobial agents. This study introduced an innovative and effective strategy for biofilm eradication by employing virus&#8208;conjugated microrobots (virus@microbots). These biofunctionalized microrobots are synthesized via the hydrothermal method, followed by the functionalization of the viruses. The synergy of microrobots&#8217; active movement and the virus's specificity boosted biofilm removal by enabling targeted binding, penetration, and effective delivery into the biofilm matrices. Additionally, compared to microrobots alone, virus@microbots significantly accelerated and refined the process. By integrating biological specificity with magnetic responsiveness, this approach demonstrated the efficacy of virus@microbots as a viable antibacterial strategy for biofilm elimination, offering a promising antibacterial platform for combating biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Future research should focus on optimizing microrobot design and viral conjugation protocols to enhance scalability and therapeutic specificity, paving the way for clinical translation and broader applications in infection control.

         <title>Tunable Structural Colors with &#8216;Light&#8208;Lossy&#8217; MXene Paints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vivid structural colors are generated with MXene as the absorbing layer in a multilayer interference film. The light&#8208;lossy refractive indices of various MXenes largely expand the color gamut, outperforming the conventional metals and semiconductors. The unique optical properties of the MXene family offer a versatile platform for the physical manipulation of light.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film interference with a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is a classic approach to generating structural colors for anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensors, and aesthetical demands. However, an absorbing layer capable of balancing the reflectance and absorption bands remains elusive, thereby limiting the chromatic and luminant tunability of structural coloration. Here wide&#8208;color&#8208;gamut films are reported with MXene as the absorbing layer in a simple trilayer configuration for vivid structural colors, outperforming conventional metal&#8208; and semiconductor&#8208;based films. It is demonstrated that the &#8216;lossy&#8217; refractive indices of different metallic MXene compositions broaden the absorption bandwidth of multilayer films and maintain the high reflectance, enabling a substantial and complementary gamut with high tunability beyond the area of sRGB color space. Various structural color films/patterns based on MXenes showcase the compatibility for different scenarios. The results accompanied by theoretical calculations provide insights into the fundamental understanding of light&#8208;MXene interaction in coloration. The unique optical absorbance and solution processibility of the MXene family offer a versatile platform for the physical manipulation of light beyond conventional manufacturing approaches.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition Driven by the Interplay of Vacancies and Charge Orders in Square&#8208;Net Materials GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;</title>

Conventional 2D/3D charge density wave (CDW) materials are limited by partial gap opening, typically retain metallic behavior even with Fermi surface nesting. This work reveals a synergistic interplay between CDW and vacancies as a distinct pathway to induce metal&#8211;insulator transition and tunable narrow bandgaps in square&#8208;net material GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;.








Abstract
Engineering narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors remains a pivotal challenge for next&#8208;generation electronic and energy devices. Charge density wave (CDW) systems offer a promising platform for bandgap engineering. However, most 2D and 3D CDW systems remain metallic despite exhibiting&#160;Fermi surface nesting. Here, a doping&#8208;dependent metal&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) with tunable bandgaps is reported in square&#8208;net materials GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948; and a cooperative interaction between CDWs and vacancies that drives the MIT is discovered. Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals the MIT in the low Sb&#8208;content regime of GdSbxTe2&#8208;x&#8208;&#948;, with a maximum energy gap of &#916; &#8776; 98 meV at x = 0.16, corroborated by electrical transport measurements. Following the MIT, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals a doping&#8208;dependent shift of the CDW wavevector toward a commensurate structure with&#160;q = 0.25 a*, concurrent with the appearance of Te vacancies in the square&#8208;net layers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations attribute the gap formation to the ordered Te vacancies modulated by the 4&#215;1&#215;1 CDW superstructure, which suppresses the electronic states near the Fermi level. Contrasting with the partial gap scenarios in conventional CDW systems, this synergy between the CDW and the vacancy stabilizes the insulating phase, offering a distinct avenue for narrow bandgap engineering in electronic materials.

         <title>Quantitative Tactile Sensing of Surface Microstructures Through Time&#8208;Domain Analysis of Piezoelectric Twin Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric twin&#8208;film architecture enables self&#8208;deducing the scanning speed, allowing for quantitative and tactile sensing of surface microstructures without external motion control systems. It achieves over 99.2% accuracy across a 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m height range, unlocking new possibilities for advanced tactile technologies in robotics, flexible electronics, and human&#8211;machine interfaces, as well as for in situ surface characterization methods.








Abstract
Tactile sensors enabling human&#8208;like behavior to identify surface microstructures are essential for humanoid robots to interact precisely with complex environments. Most existing approaches use materials responding to dynamic forces and rely on machine learning methods to distinguish various types of surface microstructures. Quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures is significant but challenging, especially under the requirement of eliminating external bulky motion&#8208;control systems. Here, a quantitative tactile surface profiling strategy is presented through time&#8208;domain analysis of the signal of a piezoelectric twin&#8208;film architecture. The architecture uses two parallel piezoelectric films with a fixed interlayer distance, generating twin voltage signals with a time delay, which is inversely proportional to the scanning speed, and consequently removes the need for motion control. The microstructure heights correlate with the peak voltages, whereas widths and edge profiles are derived from the temporal analysis of distinct signal features. Tactile and in situ measurement of surface microstructures is demonstrated with high accuracy (&gt;99.2%) over a broad height range of 1&#8211;1000&#160;&#181;m. Furthermore, in&#8208;line quality inspection during additive manufacturing is realized by quantitatively profiling the surface microstructures. This work will drive innovations in tactile technologies that emulate and potentially surpass human capabilities and advance in situ surface characterization methods.

         <title>Force&#8208;Induced Selective Carbon&#8208;Carbon Bond Cleavage in Mechanoresponsive Topochemical Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of mechanoresponsive polymers based on polybiidenedionediyl (PBIT) derivatives exhibits distinct color changes upon mechanical stimuli such as grinding, milling, and compression. The response arises from depolymerization and backbone conjugation changes. A PBIT&#8211;PDMS composite film enables ink&#8208;free, rewritable paper, offering a simple and direct platform for stress visualization.








Abstract
Mechanoresponsive polymeric materials that respond to mechanical deformation are highly valued for their potential in sensors, degradation studies, and optoelectronics. However, direct visualization and detection of these responses remain significant obstacles. In this study, novel mechanoresponsive polybiidenedionediyl (PBIT) derivative topochemical polymers are developed that depolymerize under mechanical forces, exhibiting a distinct and irreversible color change in response to grinding, milling, and compression. This color change is attributed to the alteration of polymer backbone conjugation during elongated Carbon&#8208;Carbon (C&#9472;C) single bond cleavage. Quantum chemical pulling simulations on PBIT polymers reveals a force range of 4.3&#8211;5.0 nN associated with the selective cleavage of elongated C&#9472;C single bonds. This force range is comparable to that observed for typical homolytic mechanophores, supporting the mechanistic interpretation of homolytic bond scission under mechanical stress. C&#9472;C bond cleavage kinetic studies of PBIT under compression indicates that strong interchain interactions significantly increase the pressure needed to cleave the elongated C&#9472;C bonds. Additionally, PBIT polymer thin films are composited with polydimethylsiloxane to create free&#8208;standing and robust thin films, which can serve as ink&#8208;free and rewritable paper for writing and stress visualization applications. This advancement opens new possibilities for utilizing crystalline and brittle topochemical polymers in practical applications.

         <title>Near&#8208;Unity Quantum Yield Conductive Inks of Lead&#8208;Free Double Perovskite Quantum Dots for White LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb3+/Mn2+ co&#8208;doping transforms Cs2NaInCl6 double&#8208;perovskite quantum dots (QDs) from disordered, trap&#8208;rich lattices into ordered, defect&#8208;suppressed emitters. Short&#8208;chain conductive ligands enhance carrier transport, delivering near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and a record 0.91% external quantum efficiency (EQE) in lead&#8208;free double perovskite white LEDs. This solution&#8208;processable system integrates lattice ordering with ligand engineering to enable eco&#8208;friendly, high&#8208;performance broadband solid&#8208;state lighting.








Abstract
Double perovskite quantum dots (QDs) with self&#8208;trapped exciton emission provide an eco&#8208;friendly route to broadband white&#8208;light generation. Yet severe charge losses arising from trap&#8208;mediated recombination and inefficient carrier transport remain major obstacles to their integration into electroluminescent devices. Here, Sb3+/Mn2+ co&#8208;doped Cs2NaInCl6 QD inks are reported that enable the fabrication of defect&#8208;suppressed, conductive QD films with low charge transport and hole&#8208;injection barriers in light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) devices. Sb3+/Mn2+ co&#8208;doping not only induces white emission but also suppresses cation disorder, leading to near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. Moreover, replacing long&#8208;chain ligands with short&#8208;chain 2&#8208;ethylhexanoic acid and 3,3&#8208;diphenylpropylamine chloride enhances the film conductivity by nearly 20&#8208;fold and induces a favorable band alignment with the poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole):poly[N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(4&#8208;butylphenyl)&#8208;N,N&#8242;&#8208;bis(phenyl)&#8208;benzidine] hole transport layer, hereby reducing the injection barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. These improvements enable an LED external quantum efficiency of 0.91% (0.05&#160;cm2)&#8212;the highest reported for double perovskite QDs and nearly 1.3 the previous record. It is anticipated that this work provides a viable route toward overcoming the key limitations of double perovskite electroluminescence and advancing eco&#8208;friendly solid&#8208;state lighting.

These improvements enable an LED external quantum efficiency of 0.91% (0.05&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8212;the highest reported for double perovskite QDs and nearly 1.3 the previous record. It is anticipated that this work provides a viable route toward overcoming the key limitations of double perovskite electroluminescence and advancing eco-friendly solid-state lighting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Agile Stealth: Bioinspired Metamaterials with Continuous Dynamic Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by moth eyes, this paper designs a mechanically reconfigurable EM&#8208;absorbing metamaterial with ultra&#8208;wideband absorption (2&#8211;40 GHz, 90% efficiency, 180.95% bandwidth) and at least six tunable resonant peaks (&gt;3 GHz tuning, RL &lt; &#8722;20 dB). It enables dynamic RCS control and coding programmability, offering a promising solution for next&#8208;gen stealth and multifunctional EM devices.








Abstract
The simultaneous realization of high&#8208;efficiency broadband absorption and dynamic frequency agility in electromagnetic metamaterials is a critical yet challenging goal for advanced stealth technologies. Here, a bioinspired reconfigurable metamaterial is introduced that overcomes this limitation through a novel dynamic structure&#8208;function design. Inspired by the moth&#8208;eye's truncated cone morphology, the metamaterial integrates a mechanical transmission system to precisely control the displacement of internal petal&#8208;shaped structures. This unique mechanism unlocks exceptional dual&#8208;mode performance: it maintains ultra&#8208;wideband absorption (&#8805;90%) across a vast 2&#8211;40&#160;GHz spectrum while simultaneously enabling the continuous tuning of at least six distinct, high&#8208;efficiency (&#8805;99%) absorption peaks, each with a tuning bandwidth over 3&#160;GHz. The geometric reconfiguration actively reshapes surface impedance, creating a synergistic effect that enhances overall performance. Consequently, the metamaterial demonstrates significant broadband radar cross&#8208;section (RCS) reduction and provides adaptive, deep suppression at specific threat frequencies. By incorporating coded driving, 2D control of frequency and amplitude is also realized. This integrated approach paves the way for the next generation of intelligent and high&#8208;performance adaptive stealth systems.

         <title>Physical Reservoir Computing System via Hybrid Ferroelectric&#8208;Ionic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated physical reservoir computing system is realized using hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;ionic transistors with full CMOS compatibility. Dual long&#8208;term polarization and short&#8208;term ionic switching enable scalable in&#8208;materia computation optimized for multimodal biosignal processing. The architecture delivers superior temporal dynamics, tunable memory, and energy&#8208;efficient performance, advancing hardware&#8208;based neural networks for practical edge AI healthcare applications.








Abstract
In&#8208;materia computing, harnessing material complexity for energy&#8208;efficient computation, drives breakthroughs in constructing physical reservoir computing (PRC), a promising paradigm for energy&#8208;efficient handling of dynamic temporal tasks. However, the integration of PRC components into complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and very large&#8208;scale integration (VLSI)&#8208;scalable platforms remains challenging, particularly in two&#8208;terminal devices that utilize exotic material systems. Herein, the integration of hafnia&#8208;based hybrid ferroelectric&#8208;ionic field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) is reported for in&#8208;materia PRC with all&#8208;FET structures. Hybrid FETs with dual long&#8208;term polarization switching and short&#8208;term ionic switching functionality are integrated into PRC via wafer&#8208;scale atomic layer deposition on a single wafer, guaranteeing CMOS compatibility and VLSI scalability with the deposition technique and materials in modern microelectronics. The proposed PRC system effectively processes multimodal biosignals, including electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional two&#8208;terminal device&#8208;based systems by enabling adaptive temporal dynamics and tunable memory characteristics. These results pave the way for hardware&#8208;implemented dynamic neural networks that are highly energy&#8208; and area&#8208;efficient, thus advancing practical edge AI applications in healthcare and real&#8208;time signal processing.

         <title>All Drug Glassy Microneedle Patches for Instantaneous Transdermal Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carrier&#8208;free antibiotic glassy microneedles with 100%&#8208;drug payload for instant transdermal delivery are constructed via a supramolecular engineering strategy. The synergistic drug&#8208;sulfate&#8208;water interactions suppress drug crystallization and facilitate the formation of amorphous glassy networks, enabling record&#8208;high 100% drug loading, exceptional mechanical strength, and ultrafast dissolution/diffusion in the skin.








Abstract
Dissolving microneedles (DMNs) are emerging transdermal delivery platforms but rely on water&#8208;soluble polymers as carriers that inherently limit drug&#8208;loading capacity and slow release due to dissolution/diffusion barriers. Formulating drugs directly into robust DMNs is further challenged by crystallization tendencies. Here, a supramolecular engineering strategy enabling carrier&#8208;free antibiotic glass microneedles (GMNs) is presented, leveraging synergistic drug&#8208;sulfate&#8208;water interactions that suppress crystallization and form mechanically stable amorphous networks. Using tobramycin sulfate, monolithic GMNs are achieved with 100%&#8208;drug payload, exceptional strength (Young's modulus 5.1&#160;GPa), and instant transdermal delivery (threefold faster than polymer DMNs). Eliminating polymeric carriers accelerates drug diffusion by 2.6&#8208;fold, enabling deep tissue penetration for efficient biofilm eradication. In vivo evaluation demonstrates that the antibiotic GMNs effectively promote the healing of biofilm&#8208;infected skin wounds in mice and exhibit potent therapeutic efficacy against subcutaneous abscesses. This strategy extends broadly to aminoglycoside antibiotics. By replacing the polymer matrix with supramolecular&#8208;engineered amorphous networks, a next&#8208;generation DMN platform is pioneered that bridges critical gaps in drug&#8208;loading efficiency, dissolution kinetics, and clinical translation for urgent therapeutic applications.

         <title>Grain Boundary Strengthening Enables Microstructural Regulation of Electrolytes for Robust Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grain boundary strengthening electrolyte is developed for zinc metal batteries, in which refined reverse micelle motifs assemble into densely anion&#8208;participating boundaries that reorganize the solvation environment. This microstructural regulation simultaneously accelerates Zn2+ transfer dynamics and suppresses Grotthuss&#8208;mediated H+/OH&#8722; transport, thereby enabling dendrite&#8208;free deposition, mitigated hydrogen evolution, and exceptionally stable and reversible zinc cycling.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) suffer from notorious dendrite formation and interfacial side reactions, hindering their long&#8208;term stability and practical deployment. Here, a grain boundary strengthening electrolyte (GBSE) is reported featuring numerous boundaries with unique anion&#8208;participating interfacial composition of reverse micelle motifs. This microstructural regulation effectively suppresses proton and hydroxyl anion transport via the Grotthuss mechanism, while enhancing zinc ion transfer dynamics. Accompanied by the in situ formation of the high&#8208;fluorinated solid&#8208;electrolyte interface (SEI), the Zn metal anode achieves a remarkable 99.8% coulombic efficiency and a lifespan of over 3000 h with a cumulative deposition capacity exceeding 12&#160;000 mAh cm&#8210;2, demonstrating excellent dendrite suppression and reversibility in the GBSE. This microstructural design substantially enhances the stability of high&#8208;voltage Zn||graphite batteries (310 cycles, 92.5% capacity retention) and the performance of highly safe and practical ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;scale Zn||Mn&#8208;doped V2O5 pouch cells, achieving a superior cumulative cycling capacity of 510 Ah over 450 cycles with 96.5% capacity retention and 81.65% depth of discharge. This study features a new insight into microstructural regulation and grain boundary strengthening strategy of electrolytes for high&#8208;performance ZMBs.

         <title>A Hypoxia&#8208;Activatable Prodrug for Targeted Combination Therapy of Hepatoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;activatable prodrug (POPZ) is screened out from three synthesized N&#8208;oxide&#8208;containing perylene diimide (PDI)&#8208;based oligomers, and it can self&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (POPZ NPs). The biocompatible POPZ can be reduced to highly cytotoxic PPZr in hypoxic tumors, accompanied by the generation of enhanced photothermal properties and type&#8208;I photodynamic effect, which can be applied to targeted combination therapy of hepatoma.








Abstract
Precision medicine is characterized by high accuracy and safety, showing robust superiority and significant potential in clinical applications. Organelle&#8208;targeting therapies are important tactics for precision medicine, allowing for efficient tumor treatment and reduced off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, a mitochondria&#8208;targeting and hypoxia&#8208;activatable nanoprodrug (POPZ NPs) is prepared. The N&#8208;oxide groups of POPZ NPs can successfully target mitochondria and are reduced to tertiary amines by Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450s), which are highly expressed in hypoxic tumors and located in the inner mitochondrial membranes. Biocompatible POPZ NPs can become cytotoxic and produce type&#8208;I photodynamic activities and enhance photothermal properties after reduction by CYP450s. The tumor&#8208;specific activatable prodrug reveals potent efficacy for tumor elimination without causing systemic toxicity. This work may provide a paradigm for achieving precision medicine as well as more convenient and feasible tumor combination therapy.

         <title>Bi&#8208;Functional Topospecific Nanoparticles to Promote Immune&#8208;Tumor Cell Engagement as A New Immunotherapeutic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Janus&#8208;engineered nanoplatform (J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1), featuring separate tumor&#8208; and immune&#8208;targeting faces, bridges melanoma cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes using toposelective pHLIP and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 presentation. This strategy elicits robust antitumor responses, promotes immunogenic tumor cell death, suppresses lung metastasis in vivo, and provides a modular, safer alternative for versatile immune engagement in cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a promising alternative approach, enabling the body's immune system to fight cancer. Cytotoxic T cells play a pivotal role in recognizing and eliminating tumor cells, and their effectiveness relies on establishing a physical interaction and efficient communication with cancer cells. However, this communication is often disrupted by immune escape mechanisms, allowing cancer progression. A versatile nanoplatform is developed to restore cellular connection using Janus mesoporous silica&#8208;Au nanoparticle (J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1), including specific binding sites on opposite faces for simultaneous binding to cancer cells and immune cells. The two differential surfaces on the nanoparticle allow orthogonal functionalization with the anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody that interacts with the PD&#8208;1 receptor in cytotoxic T cells on the gold face and the pH Low Insertion Peptide (pHLIP), which undergoes specific insertion into the tumor cell membrane on the silica face. J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 nanoparticles effectively bind the surface of tumor cells and capture T cells, facilitating the formation of immune synapse&#8208;like structures that lead to reduced cancer cell viability in vitro, associated with immunogenic cell death signatures. The therapeutic potential of J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 is also demonstrated in an in vivo metastatic melanoma model, where treatment with J&#8208;pHLIP&#8208;PD1 produces a significant decrease in metastatic burden and increases T cell presence. The Janus nanosystem represents an attractive platform that expands the toolbox of immune&#8208;engaging strategies, offering a flexible alternative to conventional immunotherapies that link immune and tumor cells, restoring cell&#8211;cell communication for cancer elimination.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Artificial Muscle&#8208;Tendon Complex of Liquid Crystal Elastomer for Bidirectional Afferent&#8208;Efferent Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Muscle&#8211;tendon complex (MTC)&#8208;inspired Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE)&#160;artificial muscle integrates actuation (efferent) and proprioceptive sensing (afferent) by combining contractile nematic and elastic isotropic LCEs within a single soft structure. Embedded liquid metal channels enable simultaneous Joule heating and real&#8208;time sensing of length and force. The proposed system demonstrates effective closed&#8208;loop control applicable to physical human&#8211;robot interaction.








Abstract
The muscle&#8208;tendon complex (MTC) in biological systems integrates contractile actuation and proprioceptive sensing, enabling coordinated feedback control of muscle activations through simultaneous afferent (sensory) and efferent (motor) signaling. To achieve similar functionality, artificial muscles, often based on polymeric materials with intricate material behaviors, require embedded proprioceptive capabilities to enable adaptive and reliable feedback control. Here, an artificial MTC&#8208;inspired liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscle with embedded physical intelligence is presented that supports simultaneous sensing and actuation. The proposed system utilizes embedded liquid metal (LM) channels for Joule heating and sensing of mechanical states, such as force and length, within the LCE structure. The multimaterial design combines isotropic LCE and nematic LCE, each with distinct thermomechanical properties optimized for specific functions, allowing for responsive contractile actuation&#160;and efficient proprioception. Integrated within a single, compact structure, this artificial muscle combines all sensing and actuation components, enhancing compliance and proprioceptive functionality. Furthermore, the LCE actuators are arranged in an antagonistic pair, mirroring the setup of biological muscles, to improve controllability and coordination. These MTC&#8208;inspired LCE artificial muscles demonstrate closed&#8208;loop feedback control in robotic applications, such as a robotic finger and gripper system, highlighting the potential of embedded physical intelligence in advanced robotic control systems.

         <title>Arbitrarily Shapeable Couplant with Fluidity Onset for Conformal Ultrasound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative couplant is presented, comprising fibers and dynamically cross&#8208;linked polysilicone, that transitions from solid to fluid when stress exceeds a threshold. This stress&#8208;triggered fluidity, coupled with acoustic transparency, enables seamless conformability to complex geometries and reliable long&#8208;term performance, addressing challenges in imaging steep curves and pressure&#8208;sensitive tissues for industrial and medical applications.








Abstract
Couplant is indispensable for ultrasound examinations. However, shape adaptability and operational feasibility, which are both crucial, cannot be provided conjointly by existing couplants due to their either liquid or solid form. Here an ideal couplant composed of fibers and dynamically cross&#8208;linked polysilicone is reported, which exhibits a unique solid&#8208;to&#8208;fluid transition upon application of stress exceeding a threshold. Together with the acoustically transparent feature, the particularity of the stress&#8208;triggered fluidity allows conformal adapting to arbitrary geometries under stress exertion and stable preserving for long&#8208;term and reliable ultrasound examination after stress release. Steeply curved geometries and pressure&#8208;sensitive tissues, which are extremely challenging for the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrasound modalities, are successfully graphed or treated. This couplant integrates the merits of liquids and solids, providing new opportunities for various ultrasound in industrial and medical fields.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Powered Terahertz Metamaterials as a Real&#8208;Time Biosensing Platform for In Vivo Thrombus Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MXene&#8208;powered terahertz (THz) metamaterial platform significantly enhanced early, real&#8208;time in vivo thrombus detection sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) for cardiovascular disease patients, surpassing current methods like thromboelastogram and activated clotting time (ACT) method. This system detects thrombus 6 min faster and provided anticoagulant feedback 2 min earlier than ACT, enabling personalized clinical anticoagulation strategies to reduce thrombotic risk.








Abstract
Precise, timely, and personalized in vivo thrombus monitoring is critical for improving the treatment effectiveness and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has become increasingly important as a novel tool in biomedical engineering due to its rapid analysis ability, high temporal resolution, and label&#8208;free measurement modality. However, achieving high thrombus sensing performance in real blood environments remains a significant challenge. In this work, a thrombus sensing platform is developed using an MXene&#8208;powered THz hybrid metamaterial, which substantially increases early thrombus detection sensitivity and real&#8208;time sensing ability by utilizing the highly sensitive THz response from the interfacial charge transfer between MXene and the thrombus. When applied to patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, the sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) of diagnosing a thrombus using this platform surpassed the capabilities of current clinical methods, including the thromboelastogram and the activated clotting time (ACT) method. Furthermore, the platform provides faster assay performances for in vivo thrombus detection (6&#160;min in advance) and anticoagulant effectiveness feedback (2&#160;min in advance) than the ACT method. The proposed platform demonstrates the potential for tailoring clinical anticoagulation strategies for individual patients to substantially reduce the current high risk of thrombus complications among those with CVDs.

     alt="MXene-Powered Terahertz Metamaterials as a Real-Time Biosensing Platform for In Vivo Thrombus Monitoring"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel MXene-powered terahertz (THz) metamaterial platform significantly enhanced early, real-time in vivo thrombus detection sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) for cardiovascular disease patients, surpassing current methods like thromboelastogram and activated clotting time (ACT) method. This system detects thrombus 6 min faster and provided anticoagulant feedback 2 min earlier than ACT, enabling personalized clinical anticoagulation strategies to reduce thrombotic risk.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Precise, timely, and personalized in vivo thrombus monitoring is critical for improving the treatment effectiveness and clinical outcomes of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy has become increasingly important as a novel tool in biomedical engineering due to its rapid analysis ability, high temporal resolution, and label-free measurement modality. However, achieving high thrombus sensing performance in real blood environments remains a significant challenge. In this work, a thrombus sensing platform is developed using an MXene-powered THz hybrid metamaterial, which substantially increases early thrombus detection sensitivity and real-time sensing ability by utilizing the highly sensitive THz response from the interfacial charge transfer between MXene and the thrombus. When applied to patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy, the sensitivity (94.7%) and accuracy (92.3%) of diagnosing a thrombus using this platform surpassed the capabilities of current clinical methods, including the thromboelastogram and the activated clotting time (ACT) method. Furthermore, the platform provides faster assay performances for in vivo thrombus detection (6&#160;min in advance) and anticoagulant effectiveness feedback (2&#160;min in advance) than the ACT method. The proposed platform demonstrates the potential for tailoring clinical anticoagulation strategies for individual patients to substantially reduce the current high risk of thrombus complications among those with CVDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Reaction Heterogeneity for Robust Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reaction heterogeneity is tailored precisely within Li&#8208;rich cathode materials, which not only helps alleviate the notorious oxygen release as well as parasitic interfacial side reactions, but also improve the Li+ diffusion kinetics by means of highly ordered cationic arrangement and enhanced mechanical stability, thereby boosting the electrochemical properties.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLO) cathode is hindered by severe capacity and voltage degradation resulting from severe oxygen release and irreversible phase transition. Herein, the reaction heterogeneity, which describes the spatially resolved electrochemical divergence within individual cathode particles, is engineered through compositional gradient design to couple Li+ transport kinetics and the anion redox activity between particle interiors and surfaces. It is revealed that Co/Mn concentration gradient within particles creates heterogeneous phase content distribution and structural ordering, inducing surface&#8208;bulk reaction heterogeneity that significantly impacts the overall electrochemical performance. Specifically, Li2MnO3&#8208;poor and Co&#8208;enriched surface effectively mitigates the oxygen loss and enhances electrochemical reaction kinetics, benefited from the reduced surface redox reactivity and induced highly ordered intra&#8208;layered cationic arrangement. Meanwhile, the Li2MnO3&#8208;enriched core with slight Li/Ni intermixing provides high reversible capacity and strong mechanical stability. Consequently, the greatly enhanced anion redox reversibility, Li+ diffusion dynamics, and structure stability endow LLO with exceptional electrochemical properties, showing a capacity retention of 86.0% and a reduced voltage decay of 0.518&#160;mV per cycle after 500 cycles at 1 C. This work provides a valuable strategy to tailor the redox chemistry and achieve robust LLO.

         <title>Emergent Berry Curvature in Inversion&#8208;Symmetric Photonic Crystals for Ultraconfined Topological States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, nonzero Berry curvature in photonic crystals is induced by breaking unit cell inversion symmetry through spatial shifts rather than geometrical modifications. This enables the design of ultraconfined topological states with subwavelength in&#8208;plane field confinement and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane field isolation. These results provide a new approach for high&#8208;density on&#8208;chip photonic integration of topological waveguides without breaking time&#8208;reversal symmetry.








Abstract
An interface between two periodic structures is topological when the global periodicity cannot be restored through local deformations. In time&#8208;reversal symmetric photonic crystals, such interfaces typically form between structures with distinct topological phases characterized by nonzero Berry curvature, which is conventionally induced by breaking spatial inversion symmetry through the modifications of air hole sizes and positions. Here, a topological interface is formed between photonic crystals by breaking the unit cell inversion symmetry via spatial shifts (&#916;y=&#177;a3${{\Delta}}y = \pm \frac{a}{{\sqrt 3 }}$). This modifies the rotational symmetry of a honeycomb photonic crystal unit cell from C6 to C3, which induces nonzero Berry curvature in the lower photonic band. It is further shown that nonzero Berry curvature emerges in any photonic crystals with bulk inversion symmetry and C3 symmetric unit cells, regardless of lattice structure or in&#8208;plane polarization. Using this unit cell, a glide&#8208;symmetric interface is designed to support an ultraconfined topological state that exhibits single&#8208;unit&#8208;cell (0.2&#955;) in&#8208;plane field confinement, subwavelength bending radius (0.24&#955;), and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane isolation. These findings challenge the conventional view that geometrical modifications are necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry and generate nonzero Berry curvature in time&#8208;reversal symmetric photonic crystals, offering it as a promising platform for high density, subwavelength scale photonic integration.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Wide&#8208;Field Visual Neuron Implemented with Ultra&#8208;Low Information Loss Population Coding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Demonstration of wide&#8208;field visual neurons employing MoSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions with TS integration. The population&#8208;coded architecture reduces information distortion rate by 82.1% vs single devices (p &lt; 0.0001), while achieving broad receptive field coverage through complementary 473 nm (MoS2) and 808 nm (MoSe2) sensitivity. This bio&#8208;inspired design combines mammalian visual principles with scalable semiconductor fabrication for advanced machine vision applications.








Abstract
Modern neuromorphic systems face critical bottlenecks in emulating biological vision, particularly in reconciling wide&#8208;spectrum perception, distortion&#8208;free encoding, and population&#8208;level signal processing. Drawing inspiration from the stochastic&#8208;resilient population coding of macaque visual neurons, an advanced visual neuron prototype is developed that incorporates photoelectric multi&#8208;stimulation field&#8208;effect transistor and innovative parallel threshold&#8208;switch architecture. The visual neuron integrates broadband photodetection (350&#8211;1000 nm) with biomimetic spike population encoding in a monolithic architecture. The photosensitive MoSe2/MoS2 heterojunction region in field&#8208;effect transistor extends the visual perception field from UV to infrared wavelengths (350&#8211;700 nm to 350&#8211;1000 nm), doubling the original field. Meanwhile, under the same conditions, the photocurrent response achieves a 1.36&#8208;fold increase from 0.109 to 0.148 A (W&#8201;cm&#8722;2)&#8722;1. The parallel threshold&#8208;switching design transforms single&#8208;unit encoding into cooperative population coding, achieving an 82.1% reduction rate in signal distortion. When deployed in a spiking neural network, this population&#8208;coding paradigm demonstrates high accuracy in pattern recognition, surpassing single neuron architectures by 12.1%, while maintaining the information processing time at the biological scale (&lt;200 ms). By unifying van der Waals heterostructure photonics with macaque&#8208;derived neural population coding principles, this work establishes a transformative framework for bioinspired vision hardware, bridging the critical gap between neuromorphic materials and cortical processing efficiency.

         <title>Multimodal Nanoregulator Rescues Impaired Neurovascular Units to Attenuate Secondary Injury Following Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In recognition of the multifaceted nature of traumatic brain injury (TBI), a multimodal nanotherapeutic platform that simultaneously targets multiple key pathological processes involved in neurovascular unit disruption, attenuating secondary brain injury and enhancing cognitive outcomes is developed.








Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) triggers complex neurovascular unit (NVU) damage via ischemia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and persistent immune activation, contributing to long&#8208;term neurological deficits. However, effective NVU repair remains challenging due to the multifactorial nature of secondary injury. Here, a novel multimodal nanotherapeutic platform designed to concurrently target multiple key pathological events underlying NVU disruption is presented. This nanodrug integrates ultrasmall cerium oxide nanoparticles and IRAK&#8208;4 siRNA within a ROS&#8208;responsive poly(1,4&#8208;phenyleneacetone dimethylene thioketal) (PPADT) matrix, cloaked with neutrophil membranes for inflammation homing. At the injury lesion, the responsive nature enables on&#8208;demand drug release, eliciting synergistic therapeutic actions. Specifically, the cerium nanodots catalyze ROS scavenging and oxygen generation, alleviating oxidative stress and hypoxia to facilitate blood&#8211;brain barrier restoration, pericyte repair, and improved cerebral perfusion. Simultaneously, IRAK&#8208;4 siRNA downregulates pro&#8208;inflammatory signaling and reprograms microglia toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. In a murine TBI model, the nanotherapy promotes vascular repair, reduces brain edema, attenuates neuroinflammation, and preserves neuronal integrity. Additionally, treatment ameliorates sleep spindle loss, reduces epileptiform activity, and significantly improves cognitive performance in learning and memory tasks. This work highlights a multipronged therapeutic strategy capable of restoring NVU homeostasis and mitigating secondary brain injury, offering great promise for advancing TBI treatment.

Simultaneously, IRAK-4 siRNA downregulates pro-inflammatory signaling and reprograms microglia toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. In a murine TBI model, the nanotherapy promotes vascular repair, reduces brain edema, attenuates neuroinflammation, and preserves neuronal integrity. Additionally, treatment ameliorates sleep spindle loss, reduces epileptiform activity, and significantly improves cognitive performance in learning and memory tasks. This work highlights a multipronged therapeutic strategy capable of restoring NVU homeostasis and mitigating secondary brain injury, offering great promise for advancing TBI treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shapeshifting Nanocatalyst for CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;modal in situ characterization of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles during CO2 photoreduction sheds light on dynamic transformations occurring during reaction. The Cu(core)&#8208;Ag(shell) nanoparticles present the Ag replacement by Cu atoms. Ag is trapped at the subsurface forming a Ag&#8208;Cu&#8208;O phase, and the nanoparticle spreads over the substrate. These transformations are responsible for the enhanced performance of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles in the CO2 photoreduction.








Abstract
The conversion of CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals through a photoreduction reaction in water is a promising route to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. Enhancing selectivity toward hydrocarbons or alcohols can be achieved by Ag&#8208;Cu alloys. However, the stabilized surface state created by Ag&#8208;Cu interactions is still poorly understood. In this work, multi&#8208;modal in situ X&#8208;ray experiments reveals underlying mechanisms and the evolution of Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles under CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) conditions. Both morphological and chemical changes of Ag and Cu species induced by diffusion mechanics are tracked during nanocatalyst operation. The initial spheroid Ag&#8208;Cu nanoparticles are composed of a Cu&#8208;rich shell and Ag&#8208;rich core. The reduction treatment promotes Ag migration toward the surface. During photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction, Cu atoms migrate back to the surface, forming Ag&#8208;Cu&#8208;O species. The study observes the surface oxidation of Cu(0) to Cu+ and the presence of Ag at the sub&#8208;surface region. Furthermore, nanoparticles change their shape, decreasing their specific surface area, driven by Cu diffusion during the CO2 photoreduction reaction. The results provide invaluable insights into the dynamic restructuring of the catalyst under reaction conditions and into the active species responsible for CO2 conversion.

         <title>Tuning Molecular Afterglow via Rare&#8208;Earth Complexation in Monodisperse SiO2 Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the tunable afterglow of 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;doped SiO2 microparticles via rare&#8208;earth complexation. Afterglow quantum yield and lifetime are tuned from 3.00% to 9.02% and 0.07 to 1.46&#160;s, respectively. Notably, the paramagnetic effect of rare&#8208;earth ions proves more effective than their heavy&#8208;atom effect in the afterglow tuning, enabling the development of a library of customizable, optically active SiO2 microparticles for photonic crystal applications.








Abstract
Rational control of triplet&#8208;state emissions in organic molecules is key to advancing organic phosphors for optoelectronic applications. However, achieving precise modulation of both afterglow intensity and lifetime remains challenging. Here, a tunable afterglow system based on 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (1,10&#8208;phen), enabled by rare&#8208;earth (RE3+) complexation and incorporation into SiO2 microparticles (MPs) under hydrothermal conditions, is presented. Doping 1,10&#8208;phen into SiO2 MPs activates phosphorescence at 488&#160;nm, with a quantum yield of 2.59% and a lifetime of 1.14&#160;s. Upon coordination with various RE3+ ions (La3&#8314;, Y3&#8314;, Gd3&#8314;, Lu3&#8314;), both the quantum yield (3.00&#8211;9.02%) and afterglow lifetime (0.07&#8211;1.46&#160;s) are finely tunable. Remarkably, Gd3&#8314;, through its paramagnetic effect, enhances intersystem crossing more efficiently than the heavy&#8208;atom effect of Lu3&#8314;, resulting in a higher quantum yield but a shorter afterglow duration. In contrast, Y3&#8314;, which lacks a heavy&#8208;atom effect, increases the rigidity of the 1,10&#8208;phen framework, thereby improving the phosphorescence quantum yield to 3.11% and extending the afterglow lifetime to 1.46&#160;s. These findings highlight a versatile and effective strategy for tuning the optical properties of organic molecules via RE3+ complexation within SiO2 matrices, offering promising potential for the development of advanced photonic crystal platforms in optoelectronic technologies.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Metal&#8208;Like Ferroelectric Molecular Crystal with Malleability and Ductility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferroelectric molecular crystal trimethylamine chloroborane is successfully synthesized with exceptional malleability and ductility at room temperature, achieving large compressive strain of &#8776;94% and saturation polarization of 23.9 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Ferroelectric crystals possess essential properties for a wide array of applications, while their inherent brittleness presents significant challenges in smart scenarios that demand high flexibility and customizable shapes. Herein, an aminoborane adduct ferroelectric molecular crystal, trimethylamine chloroborane (TMACB), is synthesized, showing room&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;like malleability and ductility. TMACB crystallizes in rhombohedral R3m space group at room temperature and undergoes structural phase transition to monoclinic Cc space group at 256 K. The compressive strain of TMACB single crystal can reach &#8776;94% before fracture, more than 16 times that of traditional inorganic ferroelectrics (less than 6% in general), and large ultimate tensile strain of 15.6% can also be achieved. Both polarization&#8208;electric field hysteresis loop and piezoresponse force microscopy characterizations have demonstrated ferroelectricity of TMACB, which is further firmly supported by density functional theory calculation. Moreover, compressed thin sheet of TMACB crystal maintains promising ferroelectric performance with a large polarization value of 23.9 microcoulomb per square centimeter, close to that of inorganic ferroelectric BaTiO3. The discovery breaks through the research paradigm of brittle ferroelectric materials and offers new insights into the exploration of highly deformable ferroelectric crystals for flexible wearable devices and adaptable sensor arrays in the future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submillimeter, ultrathin single&#8208;crystal NdOCl nanosheets are synthesized via modified PVD. It exhibits high&#8208;&#954; (&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage (&#8776;10&#8722;7&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a wide bandgap (4.57&#160;eV). MoS2/NdOCl FETs show a high Ion/Ioff ratio, steep subthreshold swing, suppressed scattering, and enhanced mobility. The 100&#8208;nm channel MoS2 FETs and high&#8208;gain inverters with NdOCl gate, demonstrating their potential as a next&#8208;generation 2D dielectric.








Abstract
2D dielectrics integrated with atomically thin semiconductors hold immense potential to address the scaling challenges in future nanoelectronics. However, existing 2D dielectrics are limited by insufficient dielectric constants, poor interfacial quality, and degraded gate controllability. Here, a controlled synthesis of single&#8208;crystal neodymium oxychloride (NdOCl) nanosheets with submillimeter sizes (169&#160;&#181;m) and ultrathin thickness (5&#160;nm) is presented using a modified physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach. The NdOCl nanosheets exhibit a high dielectric constant (&#954;&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage currents (&#8776;10&#8722;7&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2), and a wide bandgap of 4.57&#160;eV. MoS2/NdOCl field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) achieve high on/off current ratios (108), steep subthreshold swings, and suppressed Coulomb scattering, enabling a carrier mobility of 123&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at 80&#160;K, a value three times higher than MoS2/SiO2 FETs. The implementation of high&#8208;&#954; NdOCl dielectrics facilitates the successful fabrication of short&#8208;channel MoS2 FETs (100&#160;nm) and high&#8208;gain logic inverters (60.9). These findings underscore the great potential of NdOCl as a next&#8208;generation 2D gate dielectric for advanced, miniaturized nanoelectronic applications.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D dielectrics integrated with atomically thin semiconductors hold immense potential to address the scaling challenges in future nanoelectronics. However, existing 2D dielectrics are limited by insufficient dielectric constants, poor interfacial quality, and degraded gate controllability. Here, a controlled synthesis of single-crystal neodymium oxychloride (NdOCl) nanosheets with submillimeter sizes (169&#160;&#181;m) and ultrathin thickness (5&#160;nm) is presented using a modified physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach. The NdOCl nanosheets exhibit a high dielectric constant (&#954;&#8776;11.7), ultralow leakage currents (&#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;7&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;A&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and a wide bandgap of 4.57&#160;eV. MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/NdOCl field-effect transistors (FETs) achieve high on/off current ratios (10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;), steep subthreshold swings, and suppressed Coulomb scattering, enabling a carrier mobility of 123&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 80&#160;K, a value three times higher than MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; FETs. The implementation of high-&#954; NdOCl dielectrics facilitates the successful fabrication of short-channel MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; FETs (100&#160;nm) and high-gain logic inverters (60.9). These findings underscore the great potential of NdOCl as a next-generation 2D gate dielectric for advanced, miniaturized nanoelectronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radiofrequency Spintronic Neural Network Enabled by Electrically Modulated Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work experimentally demonstrates electrically tunable spintronic synapses and neurons based on three&#8208;terminal magnetic tunnel junctions, which are energy efficient, scalable, and suitable for complex network architectures. Through computational simulation, spintronic networks achieve high accuracies on both drone classification and the Fashion&#8208;MNIST dataset, expanding the capability of spintronic neural networks to address large&#8208;scale problems.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in nanoscale have emerged as promising candidates for energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. As a pioneering demonstration, the radiofrequency (RF) neural network based on the intrinsic RF&#8208;to&#8208;DC conversion capability of MTJs features multilayer interconnectivity and native processing of RF inputs. However, most existing devices rely on magnetic field lines to modulate their behavior in neural networks, resulting in high energy consumption and increased area overhead. Moreover, the limited tunable bandwidth of the MTJs constrains the number of synapses per layer, thereby limiting the network's potential for scaling up. In this work, electrically tunable spintronic synapses and neurons based on three&#8208;terminal MTJs are experimentally realized, where the spin&#8208;orbit torque enables precise modulation of synaptic weight and neuron output frequency. The proposed methodoffers enhanced scalability and reduces energy consumption by a factor of 21. Furthermore, multilayer networks employing both fully connected and convolutional architectures, achieving 99.2% accuracy on drone classification and 92.0% on the Fashion&#8208;MNIST image dataset, are stimulated. The convolutional design notably reduces the number of required oscillator frequency channels. The results demonstrate the feasibility of scalable, high operational frequency, and energy&#8208;efficient all&#8208;spintronic neuromorphic systems, offering a compatible platform for future neuromorphic computing applications.

         <title>Tunable Magnetism and Intrinsic Exchange Bias in Al&#8208;Substituted Terbium Iron Garnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Al substitution in terbium iron garnet thin films enables continuous tuning of the magnetic compensation temperature from 190 K to above room temperature. Near compensation, a giant intrinsic exchange bias emerges, whose sign and stochasticity can be controlled by external fields and cooling history. This approach provides new routes to engineer garnet thin films for spintronic applications.








Abstract
Ferrimagnetic insulators are central to both fundamental magnetism and diverse technologies, including spintronics, photonics, and microwave engineering. Their low damping, electrical insulation, and tunable magnetism make them ideal, especially for low&#8208;power spintronic devices. Controlling key magnetic properties &#8212;particularly the magnetic compensation&#8212; is essential for accessing ultrafast dynamics, and advanced spintronic functionalities. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic compensation temperature (TM) of an archetype ferrimagnetic insulator, terbium iron garnet (Tb3Fe5O12, TbIG), can be continuously tuned and raised to ambient temperature by partially substituting magnetic Fe atoms with nonmagnetic Al. This substitution, achieved by high&#8208;temperature co&#8208;sputtering of TbIG and Al2O3, is confirmed by atomically resolved electron microscopy. Near TM, a giant intrinsic exchange bias of up to 2.5&#160;kOe is observed. The exchange bias exhibits deterministic or stochastic behavior depending on the cooling conditions, and its polarity can be controlled via an external magnetic field. To explain the observed phenomena, a phenomenological model is developed that takes into account a distribution of local TM values induced by magnetic site disorder. These findings provide an efficient strategy for controlling TM and enabling exchange bias in TbIG that may add new functionalities for room&#8208;temperature spintronic and photonic applications.

         <title>High Efficiency and Stable Flexible Organic Solar Cells Facilitated by Light Sensitive Hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;Hydrophobic Converting Surface Modification of the Flexible Barrier Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;induced surface modification enables the direct fabrication of flexible organic solar cells on transparent barrier films. The light&#8208;sensitive material enables the interface hydrophilic&#8208;to&#8208;hydrophobic conversion, facilitates uniform electrode fabrication, and enhances the moisture barrier properties, thereby improving efficiency, flexibility, and stability of the flexible organic solar cells.








Abstract
With the advantages of high efficiency and flexibility, the flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) showed great application in wearable electronics. However, degradation of device performance due to the infiltration of water and oxygen into the flexible substrate becomes the main obstacle to its development. The traditional encapsulation with a sandwich structure would reduce the optical and mechanical properties of the devices and increase the device's weight. In this work, a strategy of in situ fabrication of highly efficient and long&#8208;term stable FOSCs on the highly transparent barrier film (BF) substrates is developed. A kind of light&#8208;sensitive material, o&#8208;nitrobenzyl alcohol derivatives, which can convert from hydrophilic to hydrophobic, is induced to improve the wettability of AgNWs on the substrate and enable the printing fabrication of a uniform AgNWs transparent electrode. After light conversion, the NBE films are converted to hydrophobic, which sufficiently improved the barrier property. The efficiency of the BF/NBE devices reached 16.33% and retained 80% of its initial value after being stored in the air for 600&#160;h, which is compared to the grid devices with the glass substrate. Besides, due to the superior mechanical properties and thin thickness, the in situ FOSCs with barrier substrates exhibited excellent mechanical bending durability.

         <title>Sensitive and Stable Tandem X&#8208;Ray Detectors Achieved by High&#8208;Quality 2D Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem detector is designed and assembled for the first time to solve the critical issue of low carrier transport efficiency in 2D perovskite SCs. The tandem SC detector establishes efficient cross&#8208;layer charge transport channels through a &#8220;layered synchronous collection&#8221; strategy, enabling a &#8220;short&#8208;range transport&#8221; mechanism, thus significantly enhanced carrier collection efficiency. The combination of high stability and sensitivity enables the tandem SC detectors achieved high&#8208;definition X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
2D perovskite single crystals (SCs) demonstrate significant potential for developing low&#8208;cost, stable, and low dose X&#8208;ray detection. However, the large interlayer spacing in 2D perovskite results in low carrier mobility, limiting the sensitivity enhancement of X&#8208;ray detection. Herein, a tandem detector is designed and assembled for the first time to solve the critical issue of low carrier transport efficiency in 2D perovskite SCs. The tandem SC detector establishes efficient cross&#8208;layer charge transport channels through a &#8220;layered synchronous collection&#8221; strategy, enabling a &#8220;short&#8208;range transport&#8221; mechanism. The unique &#8220;longitudinal short&#8208;range transport&#8221; reduces carrier transport distance and then decreases recombination and trap capture, thus significantly enhanced carrier collection efficiency. Consequently, these detectors not only maintain low dark current but also exhibit a higher response current than single&#8208;junction counterparts, resulting in superior X&#8208;ray detection performance. Specifically, the tandem SC detectors achieved a high sensitivity of 5218 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.2 n Gy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 1.8&#160;ms. Furthermore, the tandem detectors retain original response after continuous X&#8208;ray irradiation with a high dose of 2.4&#160;Gy. The combination of high stability and sensitivity enables the tandem SC detectors achieved high&#8208;definition imaging at 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1.

Specifically, the tandem SC detectors achieved a high sensitivity of 5218 &#181;C Gy&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 2.2 n Gy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a short response time of 1.8&#160;ms. Furthermore, the tandem detectors retain original response after continuous X-ray irradiation with a high dose of 2.4&#160;Gy. The combination of high stability and sensitivity enables the tandem SC detectors achieved high-definition imaging at 12.5 lp mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>De Novo Design of Polyimides Leveraging Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo design strategy for polyimides based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed and an agent, DAPiGen, for generating specific polyimides is constructed. These findings highlight the pivotal role of diamines in polyimide properties. Rigorously validated, the strategy has yielded a novel polyimide with good overall performance.








Abstract
Designing molecular structures has long been a central pursuit in organic films with super properties. However, the vast chemical space of candidate molecules poses a challenge in screening optimal materials with exceptional performance. Herein, a multi&#8208;objective performance&#8208;oriented strategy driven by deep reinforcement learning and train an agent, DAPiGen is proposed, for a de novo template&#8208;free polyimide creation. The agent combines the property predictors identified from four machine learning models and a fragment&#8208;based generation architecture with active fragments extracted from polyimides as fundamental building blocks. Its successful use is demonstrated to create several polyimides for flexible display scenarios, i.e., with specific properties such as higher transparency, lower coefficient of linear thermal expansion, superior tensile strength, and elevated glass transition temperature. Experiment validation and structural importance analysis demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed research approach. The scalable strategy presented in this work stands as a paradigm for the inverse design of a spectrum of polymeric materials, offering guidance for other structural engineering endeavors.

         <title>Homogeneity Regulation in Sequential Fabricated Perovskite Film for Industrial&#8208;Scale Deposition of Fully&#8208;Textured Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a synergistic strategy for the regulation of penetration of organic salts by employing solvent engineering combined with near&#8208;infrared irradiation pre&#8208;heating, high&#8208;quality perovskite films are obtained over industrially large area. The resultant perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem device based on industrially compatible textured silicon yields a certified efficiency of 30.6% and a laboratory efficiency of 27.1% at an active area of 1.0 and 110 cm2, respectively.








Abstract
The combination of industrially crystalline silicon with metal halide perovskites in a tandem configuration has been the focus of intense research efforts. Although a hybrid deposition method has been developed to achieve conformal and scalable growth of perovskite film on textured silicon, this dry/wet approach faces problems of incomplete reaction and phase impurities, posing a challenge for up&#8208;scaling fabrication. Herein, a synergistic strategy is demonstrated for homogeneity regulation of penetration of organic salts by employing solvent engineering in slot&#8208;die coating combined with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation pre&#8208;heating. The use of mixed solvent contributes to a phase&#8208;pure and homogeneous perovskite film by balancing the rate of solvent evaporation and reactant diffusion. Additionally, the NIR energy heats the large&#8208;area perovskite wet film directly and rapidly in the air, and thus controls the solvent volatilization for uniform phase transformation. As a result, this strategy enables the air&#8208;processed perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem device based on an industrial c&#8208;Si cell to achieve an efficiency of 30.95% (certified 30.6%) for an active area of 1.0 cm2 and obtain an efficiency of 27.1% for an aperture area of 110 cm2. Furthermore, the encapsulated large&#8208;area device retains 89% of the initial output after 1100&#160;h of maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Gel&#8208;Locked Lamellar Membranes: Overcoming the Limitations of Permeance, Selectivity, and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a facile photothermal&#8208;triggered confined gelation approach to manufacture novel gel&#8208;locked lamellar membranes (GLLMs) with versatile gel&#8208;rich nanochannel chemistry and gel&#8208;locked lamellar nanochannel architecture. These gel&#8208;locked lamellar nanochannels render GLLMs with excellent antiswelling property and extraordinary structure stability, realizing exceptional permeance, selectivity, and stability simultaneously for isotopic separation, optical resolution, organic solvent nanofiltration, and gas separation.








Abstract
Nanosheets&#8208;stacked lamellar membranes with unique 2D nanochannels are promising platform to achieve ultrafast molecule sieving over conventional membranes in numerous separation applications. Despite significant successes in material design and structure optimization, existing lamellar membranes remain challenging to achieve boosted permeance, selectivity, and stability simultaneously, owing to their limited nanochannel chemistry and unstable nanochannel architecture. Herein, a new class of gel&#8208;locked lamellar membranes (GLLMs) that feature versatile gel&#8208;decorated nanochannel chemistry and gel&#8208;crosslinked lamellar nanochannel architecture are discovered by an original photothermal&#8208;triggered confined gelation (PTCG) approach. In the PTCG, the photothermal&#8208;enabled localized heating from nanosheets is leveraged to trigger rapid and efficient generation of free radicals in their vicinity, allowing for precisely confining polymerization and gelation into lamellar nanochannels. With this method, a series of GLLMs are constructed by easily devising functional monomers and nanosheets and exhibit ultrastable nanochannel architecture with antiswelling ability in many harsh conditions. It is demonstrated that the GLLMs with customized gel&#8208;decorated nanochannels showcase boosted permeance and selectivity over conventional lamellar membranes in many separation scenarios such as isotopic separation, optical resolution, organic solvent nanofiltration, and CO2/CH4 separation. The findings represent a paradigm shift in exploiting a family of advanced lamellar membranes with broader applications.

         <title>Mechanochemical Nitrous Oxide Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas with a global warming potential of 310. A novel mechanochemical strategy is presented for decomposing N2O into harmless nitrogen and oxygen, achieving a rapid decomposition rate of 1761.3 mL h&#8722;1 and nearly complete N2O conversion of 99.98% at 42&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the top three greenhouse gases, together with carbon dioxide and methane, but it is stable enough not to be easily decomposed under thermocatalytic conditions, even at high temperature (445&#160;&#176;C). Herein, an efficient N2O decomposition method is reported using nickel oxide catalyst under mechanochemical conditions operated near ambient temperature. The mechanochemical N2O decomposition method exhibited a rapid reaction rate of 1761.3 mL h&#8722;1 and a high conversion of 99.98% even at 42&#160;&#176;C, compared to the thermochemical method (294.9 mL h&#8722;1 and 49.16% at 445&#160;&#176;C). Unlike equilibrium thermocatalytic states, the non&#8208;equilibrium mechanocatalytic states induced by intensive dynamic mechanochemical actions are responsible for effective N2O decomposition under mild temperature conditions.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printing Assisted Bidirectional &#960;&#8208;Structured Thermoelectric Generators: Reverse&#8208;Designed Flexible Architectures for Curved Heat Sources</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an innovative bidirectional &#960;&#8208;structure based on 3D printing technology, which optimizes heat conduction efficiency and enhances mechanical flexibility. Using an inverse design framework that integrates 3D scanning and curvature distribution analysis, a customized topological structure tailored to the geometry of the target heat source is developed, thereby improving thermal collection from curved surfaces.








Abstract
Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) demonstrate significant potential for sustainable energy harvesting through direct heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion. Nevertheless, conventional fully encapsulated designs face critical limitations including heat dissipation inefficiencies and restricted conformability to complex curved surfaces. This investigation proposes a breakthrough bidirectional &#960;&#8208;structured (BD&#960;&#8208;structure) that achieves enhanced mechanical compliance while establishing a mechano&#8208;electrical coupling criterion for abrupt curvature transitions. Through implementing a reverse design framework integrating 3D scanning and curvature distribution analysis, customized topological configurations are specifically developed and adapted to target heat source geometries. Concurrently, a novel photocurable composite with enhanced thermal conductivity (0.213 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1) is designed through 3D&#8208;printed structural optimization, achieving 59.1% power enhancement compared to conventional encapsulated modules. Experimental validation demonstrates remarkable surface fit tightness of 90.7% (positive Gaussian) and 80.2% (negative Gaussian), translating to exceptional power output improvements of 432.7% and 253.2% relative to non&#8208;optimized counterparts. This work establishes a comprehensive framework encompassing material innovation, structural design, and system integration strategies, significantly advancing flexible thermoelectric technology for high&#8208;efficiency energy harvesting from geometrically complex thermal sources.

         <title>Regulating Exciton Dissociation and Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction Over Single&#8208;Atom Cu&#8208;In2S3 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;valence Cu single&#8208;atom in In2S3 nanosheets can drive the separation and transfer of charge carriers, enhance the exciton dissociation as free photogenerated electrons and holes, as well as lower the reaction barrier energy. As a result, the Cu&#8208;In2S3 nanosheets demonstrate an enhanced rate of CO production in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction with/without a sacrificial agent.








Abstract
Uncovering the excitation processes of photocatalysts and enhancing the dissociation of excitons into free photogenerated electrons and holes for photocatalytic CO2 reduction is imperative yet quite challenging. Herein, an efficient strategy of reducing the binding energy of excitons to boost exciton dissociation is reported by anchoring the low valence single&#8208;atom Cu sites in In2S3 nanosheets (Cu&#8208;In2S3), which can enhance photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity. The investigations of photo&#8208;irradiated Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), in situ irradiates X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (TD&#8208;PL) indicate that the doping of low valence single&#8208;atom Cu can efficiently drive the charge transfer and separation. Moreover, the studies of the dynamic behaviors of charge carriers by femtosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopy (fs&#8208;TAS) reveal that the doping of low valence Cu single&#8208;atom sites allows the promotion of exciton dissociation by reducing the binding energy of the exciton, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic CO2 reduction of Cu&#8208;In2S3 nanosheets. The aforementioned strategy for enhancing the dissociation efficiency of excitons in photocatalysts will offer a highly efficient and promising approach for the photocatalytic CO2 reduction and other photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Giant Shell Nanorods for High&#8208;Efficiency and Low&#8208;Roll&#8208;Off Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CdSe&#8208;based nanorods enhance charge confinement, suppress leakage current, and limit EQE roll&#8208;off to just 2% across 25&#8211;1&#8201;000 mA cm&#8722;2, enabling red NR&#8208;LEDs with record&#8208;high efficiency (23.4%), brightness (289&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and lifetime (T95 10&#8201;638 h at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2).








Abstract
1D colloidal semiconductor nanorods (NRs) offer polarized emission and enhanced photon out&#8208;coupling efficiency for high&#8208;efficiency light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). However, their practical application has been limited by severe efficiency roll&#8208;off at high current densities due to thin radial shells along the radial direction and the high aspect ratio that leads to random orientation during the fabrication of solution&#8208;processed films, which causes structural gaps, triggering leakage currents and ultimately exacerbating efficiency roll&#8208;off. Here, fatty acid is introduced to mitigate the c&#8208;axial growth induced by phosphonic acid in traditional NRs synthesis, while promoting radial shell growth, thereby forming giant&#8208;shell CdSe/CdZnSe/CdS/CdZnS NRs with an aspect ratio of &#8776;2.2. This design effectively alleviates electron leakage caused by random orientation in NR films, while minimizing interfacial defects and Auger recombination, achieving a near&#8208;unity PLQY. Consequently, NR&#8208;LEDs based on these NRs exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a luminance of 289&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Significantly, this NR design greatly suppresses the EQE roll&#8208;off at high current density. Furthermore, the devices have a long T95 lifetime of more than 10&#160;000&#160;h at a luminance of 1&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This material design strategy lays the foundation for realizing highly polarized NR&#8208;LEDs for efficient high&#8208;definition displays.

         <title>Nucleophilic Redox Shuttle Surpasses the Efficiency Limitation of Oxygen Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reversible nucleophilic redox shuttle is integrated into flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries to regulate oxygen redox chemistry. The NRS mediates multielectron transfer, mitigates anode parasitic reactions, and stabilizes discharge/charge tri&#8208;phase interfaces, thereby achieving high energy efficiency, prolonged cycle life, and providing mechanistic insight into oxygen electrocatalysis in advanced metal&#8211;air systems.








Abstract
Oxygen redox is a promising route for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems, but poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and bubble desorption at the gas&#8211;liquid&#8211;solid interface limit efficiency and stability. Here, the introduction of a reversible nucleophilic electrochemistry embedded in the oxygen redox reaction, known as the nucleophilic redox shuttle (NRS), is reported to develop a strategy that surpasses the energy efficiency limitations of pure oxygen redox. By incorporating the miscible ionic liquid 1&#8208;(3&#8208;aminopropyl)imidazole (APMID) into Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), the OER during charging is replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with lower free&#8208;energy barriers. This pathway boosts the cycling energy efficiency from 63.2% to 80.1%, surpassing most oxygen redox&#8211;based systems.&#160;Additionally, a Zn@Cu anode is used to restore nucleophiles during charging, maintaining a low voltage gap of 0.30&#160;V (compared to &#8776;0.69&#160;V for common ZABs) over 2100 h of cycling at 1 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. The high reversibility of the nucleophilic reactions ensures its stable operation even in gel electrolyte, demonstrated by the integration with a wearable patch electrocardiogram detection. These findings establish NRS as a robust strategy to extend the efficiency and durability of oxygen redox systems, advancing their practical application in next&#8208;generation energy storage.

         <title>Stabilizing the High Spin Cobalt Atoms by Local Magnetic Asymmetry in p&#8208;Block Metals&#8208;Doped Spinel MnCo2O4 Catalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co&#8722;2O&#8722;Pb covalency creates a local asymmetric magnetism to stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of surface Co centers (dxy2dxz2dz21dyz1dx2&#8722;y21${{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{\mathrm{xy}}}}^{\mathrm{2}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{\mathrm{xz}}}}^{\mathrm{2}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{{\mathrm{z}}}^{\mathrm{2}}}}}^{\mathrm{1}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{\mathrm{yz}}}}^{\mathrm{1}}{{{\mathrm{d}}}_{{{{\mathrm{x}}}^{\mathrm{2}}}{\mathrm{ - }}{{{\mathrm{y}}}^{\mathrm{2}}}}}^{\mathrm{1}}$), thereby increasing greatly the transfer rate of electrons from the Co sites to triplet O2 adsorbates and the eORR efficiency.








Abstract
Spinel MnCo2O4 (MCO) is often used for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (eORR), limited kinetically by the electronic spin state of surface cobalt (Co) centers. In this work, the rate&#8208;determining step of eORR is unlocked by doping p&#8208;block metals, including Ga, In, and Pb, into MCO catalysts to stabilize the high&#8208;spin state of surface octahedral Co atoms, where the high&#8208;spin electrons are rapidly injected into triplet O2 adsorbates. The optimal Pb&#8208;doped MCO catalyst (denoted as 0.2MCPO) as an air electrode is used to setup a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) device, achieving a significantly&#8208;enhanced peak power density of 1.53 W cm&#8722;2 and remarkable stability over 210 h. The M&#9472;2O&#9472;Co covalencies make the high&#8208;spin state of surface octahedral Co atoms more stable by the p&#8208;d orbital coupling mechanism, and thus boost kinetically the electron transfer from surface Co sites to O2 adsorbates. A combination of experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that the stable high&#8208;spin state of Co atoms enhances O2 adsorption and activation, lowering the energy barriers for the homolytic cleavage of O2 into two *O atoms. These findings offer fundamental insights into spin&#8208;selected electrocatalysis for ORR and a general guidance to construction of high&#8208;performance SOFC devices for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Supramolecular Amino Acids&#8208;Encoded Nanodots (SEND) with pH&#8208; and Ion&#8208;Responsive Phase Separation for Serum&#8208;Tolerant Cytosolic Protein Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 60 supramolecular amino acid&#8208;encoded nanodots (SEND) is screened to identify candidates for serum&#8208;tolerant protein delivery. Among them, the FR (Phe&#8208;Arg) modified SEND exhibited bicarbonate&#8208;triggered liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (LSPS) driven by strengthened hydrogen bonding. This pH&#8208; and Ion&#8208;responsive LSPS protects proteins from serum&#8208;induced leakage, allowing for efficient cytosolic delivery in serum and therapeutic efficacy against lung metastasis.








Abstract
To broaden the scope of potential intracellular targets for protein drugs, artificial carriers are employed to achieve efficient cytosolic delivery. However, the majority of delivery vectors are hindered by restricted serum tolerance. Here, the screening of supramolecular amino acids&#8208;encoded nanodots (SEND) for efficient serum&#8208;tolerant cytosolic protein delivery is reported. A library of 60 nanodots is constructed by surface conjugation of different amino acids or dipeptides on cyanine five&#8208;cored polylysine dendrimers. The FR (Phe&#8208;Arg) and RW (Arg&#8208;Trp) modified SEND achieved efficient intracellular protein delivery in both serum&#8208;free and serum&#8208;containing conditions, and preserved high protein bioactivity. These two SEND can recruit a wide range of proteins and induce liquid&#8211;solid phase separation, thereby preventing the premature leakage of loaded proteins. The phase separation behavior of SEND&#8208;FR and &#8208;RW is responsive to ionic strength and pH. Moreover, SEND&#8208;FR is sensitive to bicarbonate, which promotes the hardening of SEND&#8208;FR coacervates through enhanced hydrogen bonding. Lowering the pH triggers reversion to a homogeneous phase, enabling controlled protein release. The SEND&#8208;FR is capable of sending toxic protein Saporin to the lung via systemic administration, effectively inhibiting the progression of lung metastasis. This study provides a promising strategy to construct functional nanocarriers for efficient serum&#8208;tolerant cytosolic protein delivery.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Fibril Network Engineering for Scalable and Sustainable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>

By employing a multifunctional additive strategy, high&#8208;quality films with a dual&#8208;fibril network morphology are successfully printed, achieving a remarkable PCE of 20.23% for the device and 17.26% in the module.








Abstract
Green&#8208;printed, high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaics modules are critical to the commercial expansion and practical deployment of organic photovoltaics. Since the emergence of Y6&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs is remarkable progress. However, a considerable performance gap remains between devices processed with halogenated versus non&#8208;halogenated (green) solvents, primarily due to difficulties in controlling molecular aggregation. Here, hydroxyl&#8208;rich cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) is introduced as a multifunctional additive to enhance the morphology and performance of modules fabricated via large&#8208;area green printing. CAB suppresses excessive molecular aggregation and modulates the film&#8208;formation dynamics. Crucially, its hydroxyl side groups interact synergistically with both donor and acceptor materials to induce a dual&#8208;fibril network, providing abundant interfacial area for exciton dissociation and continuous pathways for efficient charge transport. As a result, green&#8208;printed PM6:PTP&#8208;eC9 devices achieve PCE of 19.04%. Moreover, ternary PM6:PTQ&#8208;10:PTP&#8208;eC9 devices and modules with an active area of 16.94 cm2 exhibit PCEs of 20.23% and 17.26%, respectively. This work demonstrates a viable additive engineering strategy for realizing scalable, environmentally benign, and high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Plasma&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of Ni&#8208;Doped Cu&#8208;Based Catalyst Shielded by Carbon Overlayer for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>

A rapid plasma shock approach creates a Ni&#8208;doped Cu catalyst with a protective carbon overlayer for efficient ammonia electrosynthesis, which suppresses surface degradation and boosts NO3&#8722; hydrogenation by optimizing intermediate adsorption and hydrogen availability.








Abstract
Plasma&#8208;enabled N2 oxidation coupled with electrocatalytic NOx&#8722; reduction (pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR) represents a highly promising approach for sustainable, scalable, and distributed NH3 production under mild conditions. However, the eNOx&#8722;RR for NH3 synthesis is hindered by catalyst degradation, which results in low NH3 selectivity and poor stability. Here, inspired by solid&#8208;state source doping in photolithography, this work reports a rapid plasma shock strategy to build a Ni&#8208;doped Cu&#8208;based catalyst shielded by a carbon overlayer. It demonstrates long&#8208;term stability, maintaining an NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96% for 156&#160;h at a current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More importantly, this work establishes a continuous&#8208;flow pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR system using air and water as feedstocks, achieving an NH3 yield rate of 5.36&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 with an NH3 FE of 85%. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the carbon overlayer suppresses electrochemical surface degradation and stabilizes the coexistence of Cu2O and Cu during eNO3&#8722;RR, while Ni doping simultaneously balances the mismatch between NO3&#8722; adsorption and *H supply and accelerates both processes. This study provides a new approach for designing stable catalysts and offers insights into the pNOR&#8208;eNOx&#8722;RR system, paving the way for continuous NH3 production directly from air and water under ambient conditions.

         <title>Multiplexed Single&#8208;Particle Imaging Enabled by Modulation of Er3+ Energy&#8208;Level Populations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy enables multiplexed single&#8208;particle imaging by precisely tuning the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G)&#160;emission ratios of Yb/Er co&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles. Quantitative modeling and experimental validation reveal that R/G modulation is dictated by excited Yb3+ density (n1&#8242;${n}_{1}^{\prime}$), which governs energy redistribution among Er3+ states. This mechanism allows more than a tenfold spectral tunability and enables reliable multicolor tracking of molecular dynamics.








Abstract
Single&#8208;particle tracking (SPT) offers critical insights into nanoscale molecular dynamics, but is limited by short tracking durations due to irreversible photobleaching and the technical complexity of multicolor imaging. Here, a non&#8208;photobleaching ratiometric imaging strategy is developed based on lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), exploiting their intrinsic, tunable red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) emission ratios for multiplexed SPT. Single&#8208;particle characterization reveals over 10&#8208;fold tunability. Mechanistic investigations show that this ratiometric behavior is governed by Yb3+ excitation density, which modulates the energy distribution within energy levels of Er3+ ions. Specifically, high Yb3+ excitation densities enhance three&#8208;photon transitions, favoring red emission, while lower densities promote two&#8208;photon upconversion and green emission. Both processes proceed through a shared energy level of 2H11/2, leading to competitive energy transfer dynamics. Based on this competition mechanism, a quantitative relationship is further established between UCNPs structure and the resulting R/G emission ratio, allowing reliable prediction of spectral output across different designs. Leveraging this tunable ratiometric principle, simultaneous five&#8208;color single&#8208;particle imaging is demonstrated with a misidentification rate below 5%. This strategy is further applied to visualize receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis in live cells. This work highlights the advantages of upconversion luminescence&#8208;based R/G ratio discrimination for long&#8208;term, multicolor SPT, offering a simple and reliable tool for probing complex biological processes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Eu3+ Complexes Enabling Multistimuli&#8208;Responsive Data Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through J&#8208;aggregation assembly of engineered Eu(THA)3, multistimuli&#8208;responsive Eu&#8208;NPs and Eu/DTE&#8208;NPs are created exhibiting: i) pH&#8208;switchable red/green emission (614/480 nm), ii) thermally&#8208;quenched luminescence with high lifetime sensitivity, and iii) UV/Vis&#8208;toggled FRET switching. Also, nanoconfinement boosted quantum yield and lifetime by suppressing non&#8208;radiative decay. These properties enabled dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting platforms (labels/QR codes/hydrogels) and dual&#8208;key PUF tags (intensity/lifetime).








Abstract
Multistimuli&#8208;responsive luminescent materials are pivotal for next&#8208;generation information encryption, yet integrating orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, high reversibility, and nanoscale programmability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, Eu3+&#8208;based nanoparticles (Eu&#8208;NPs) are constructed with triply orthogonal stimuli&#8208;responsive luminescence (pH/thermal/light) through J&#8208;aggregation&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly of a tailored &#946;&#8208;diketone complex (Eu(THA)3). Spatial confinement within the nanostructure suppresses non&#8208;radiative decay, enhancing the luminescence quantum yield while extending the lifetime. Crucially, the Eu&#8208;NPs enable: i) Reversible pH&#8208;switching between red Eu3+ emission (614 nm) and green ligand AIE (480 nm) with good cyclability; ii) Linear thermal quenching for dual&#8208;mode thermometry (intensity sensitivity: 3.82%&#183;K&#8722;1; lifetime sensitivity: 7.46%&#183;K&#8722;1); iii) UV/Vis&#8208;light&#8208;modulated FRET with dithienylethene (DTE) enabling single&#8208;particle ON/OFF switching. Leveraging these properties, hierarchical encryption platforms are developed, including dynamically responsive printed labels, QR codes, and hydrogels. Furthermore, exploiting inherent assembly randomness, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) are fabricated with dual&#8208;key (intensity/lifetime) authentication and ultrahigh encoding capacity (41,600). This strategy establishes a new paradigm for adaptive anti&#8208;counterfeiting by integrating dynamic data encryption with physically unclonable security in a single rare&#8208;earth nanoplatform.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Iontronic Hydrogels Generating Biomimetic Endogenous Bioelectricity for Promoting Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable mechano&#8208;iontronic hydrogel is designed to enhance cartilage repair, which generates iontronic electricity under deformation, closely mimicking the characteristics and mechanisms of natural cartilage. The coupled iontronic electricity and mechanical stimulation are shown to reprogram the metabolic microenvironment, enhancing glutamine metabolism and accelerating the cartilage regeneration process.








Abstract
Articular cartilage regeneration has long been a formidable challenge because of its avascular and aneural nature. Traditional approaches, using exogenous electrical stimulation or electroactive materials, often fail to align with the endogenous iontronic bioelectricity of natural cartilage. Herein, an implantable mechano&#8208;iontronic hydrogel (MI&#8208;hydrogel) is biomimetically designed to enhance cartilage repair. This MI&#8208;hydrogel generates iontronic electricity under deformation, closely mimicking the characteristics and mechanisms of natural cartilage. It is demonstrated that the MI&#8208;hydrogel synergistically integrates iontronic electricity and mechanical stimulation during physical activity, activating the ion channel protein Piezo1. This activation promotes the chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells in vitro and facilitates cartilage repair in vivo. Additionally, these coupled effects are shown to reprogram the metabolic microenvironment, enhancing glutamine metabolism and accelerating the cartilage regeneration process. This study not only underscores the potential of the MI&#8208;hydrogel as a novel therapeutic platform but also introduces a new mechanism for tissue regeneration, paving the way for innovative approaches in regenerative medicine.

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional microrobot with gold nanospikes enables magnetic navigation, lesion sampling, and AI&#8208;enhanced SERS&#8208;based tissue analysis for targeted biopsy of deep&#8208;seated tracheal microlesions. This integrated micro&#8208;robotic approach represents an accurate, noninvasive, and rapid biopsy technology, providing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept solution to renovate current clinical workflows for early lung cancer diagnosis.








Abstract
Biopsy remains gold standard for definitive diagnosis of numerous diseases, yet conventional approaches confront inherent limitations encompassing procedural invasiveness, limited spatial resolution, poor deep&#8208;tissue accessibility, and complicated post&#8208;operative histopathology examinations. Herein, a multifunctional magnetically actuated microrobotic platform for targeted biopsy of deep&#8208;seated micro&#8208;lesion in lung for potential use of early lung cancer diagnosis is reported. This conical helix&#8208;structured microrobot features controllable gold nanospike decoration at its tip, integrating dual functionality in drilling&#8208;enabled tissue sampling and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) biosensing. Utilizing real&#8208;time tracheoscopy and fluoroscopy guidance, this platform achieves magnetic navigation through saline&#8208;filled bronchi to target lesions, followed by on&#8208;demand sampling and retrieval, whose feasibility is systematically verified through ex vivo porcine lung models and in vivo rabbit trials. The collected biomarker and tissue samples can be rapidly recognized and quantified based on SERS spectroscopy. Moreover, through establishing a convolutional neural network&#8208;based deep learning model, it is succeed to distinguish between the healthy and various cancerous lung tissues from clinical patients, achieving a recognition accuracy of over 94.3% within just 3&#160;min. Therefore, this work represents a microrobot&#8208;based biopsy techniques for noninvasive and precise sampling in lung with diagnosis capability of early&#8208;stage lung cancer, offering substantial improvements over conventional biopsy methods.

One&#8208;step interfacial redox strategy for enhancing catalytic performance in seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Direct seawater electrolysis is a promising strategy for sustainable hydrogen production, yet it faces critical challenges in catalyst design, including scalability, chloride corrosion resistance, and cost efficiency. A one&#8208;step interfacial redox strategy is reported to construct Fe/Co co&#8208;doped Ru@Ni(OH)2 electrodes (Ru@FeCo&#8211;Ni(OH)2), enabling precise control of metal coordination environments while ensuring industrial&#8208;scale manufacturability. This method enables the fabrication of 5000 cm2 electrodes with no performance deviation, demonstrating compatibility with commercial electrolyzers. The Ru@FeCo&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrodes exhibit remarkable durability (&gt;3000&#160;h) and achieve hydrogen production at $0.87 per kg using natural seawater from the South China Sea (unpurified, with KOH added), surpassing the U.S. Department of Energy's 2031 cost target of $1 per kg. Operando spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveal a synergistic co&#8208;doping mechanism: 1) d&#8208;band center downshifting (&#916;E = 0.68&#160;eV) optimizes hydrogen adsorption for superior hydrogen evolution reaction performance, while 2) accelerated surface reconstruction forms chloride&#8208;resistant oxyhydroxide layers, improving oxygen evolution reaction efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm in bifunctional catalyst design, providing mechanistic insights into active site evolution and a scalable pathway for cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production directly from seawater.

         <title>From Irreversible to Reversible: Nucleophilic Reactions Enhance Fast Kinetics and Superior Cycling Stability in High Voltage Lithium&#8208;Organosulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diphenyl tetrasulfide (PTS) is composited with tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) with a PTS:TMTM molar ratio of 1:4 to form a PT14 cathode. The Li&#8208;PT14 cell shows a high discharge voltage of 2.55 V and retains 90% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at 1 C. It also shows promising performances at elevated temperatures. When paired with a lithiated graphitic anode, the full cell delivers a capacity retention of 97% after 840 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, a Li&#8208;PT14 pouch cell remains 100% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles.








Abstract
Organosulfur represents a class of promising candidates as cathode materials for rechargeable batteries. However, their development has been hindered by several key factors, including low discharge voltage, shuttle of polysulfides, and sluggish kinetics. Herein, tetramethylthiuram monosulfide (TMTM) is introduced as a functional substrate and composited with diphenyl tetrasulfide (PTS), which is denoted as PT14. During discharge, PTS generates benzenethiolate and sulfide anions, both of which can in situ react with TMTM forming new electrochemical reactive species. This design mitigates the polysulfide shuttle effect and enables rapid reaction kinetics. The Li&#8208;PT14 cell shows a high discharge voltage of 2.55&#160;V and retains 90% of the initial capacity after 700 cycles at a 1C rate. When the temperature is increased to 60&#160;&#176;C, the cell retains 95% of the initial capacity after 500 cycles. When paired with a lithiated carbon paper anode (LiC) to form a full cell, it delivers a capacity retention of 97% after 840 cycles at N/P = 3.5 and 0.5 C rate. Furthermore, a 100 mAh pouch cell assembled with the PT14 cathode shows no capacity loss after 50 cycles. This work provides a new strategy to develop advanced rechargeable batteries based on organosulfur cathode materials.

         <title>Acupuncture&#8208;Inspired Active&#8208;Material Microenvironment Engineering for High&#8208;Throughput Thick Electrodes by Instant Microneedle Templating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Chinese acupuncture, a microneedle&#8208;array templated extrusion (MATE) technology and an active&#8208;material microenvironment (AMME) therapy theory are proposed. This enables ultrafast fabrication of 3D thick electrodes with ordered channels, achieving a 300% capacity increase at 60 mg cm&#8722;2. The AMME therapy theory provides deeper insight into the rational design of pore structure of thick electrodes.








Abstract
Rational design and ultrafast fabrication of high&#8208;throughput thick electrodes are essential for high&#8208;energy and power density batteries. However, it is blocked by the lack of both theory and cost&#8208;effective technologies for regulating the active&#8208;material microenvironment (AMME) that fundamentally controls the ion and electron transport for each active&#8208;material particle. Here, inspired by the Chinese&#8208;acupuncture therapy that employs microneedles to dredge the cell microenvironment, a microneedle&#8208;array templated extrusion (MATE) technology is proposed along with an AMME&#8208;therapy theory to address the above challenges. Specifically, a unique clay&#8208;alike thixotropic (CAT) slurry through sol&#8208;binder is first fabricated with significant capabilities in 3D&#8208;morphing. Enabled by this morphable CAT&#8208;slurry, MATE technology is further developed to rapidly and seamlessly fabricate high&#8208;throughput 3D thick electrodes with customizable ordered ion&#8208;transport channels. Consequently, the optimized 3D thick electrode shows a remarkable improvement in specific capacity by 300% even at an ultrahigh active&#8208;material loading of 60&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (ca. 3 times the commercial level). Finally, an AMME therapy theory based on an artificial potential field algorithm for ion&#8208;transport path optimization is established to understand the enhanced ion&#8208;transport dynamics. The proposed AMME&#8208;therapy theory and industry&#8208;friendly MATE technology could advance&#160;the design and fabrication of high&#8208;throughput electrodes in batteries and other electrochemical energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Implanting Crystal Nuclei at the Buried Interface to Regulate the Growth of Inorganic Perovskite for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface of TiO2 with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminobutyl)guanidine sulfate (AGS) is modified to improve the performance of inorganic perovskite solar cells. AGS can induce in situ formation of PbSO4 crystal nuclei and regulate perovskite crystallization. Furthermore, better energy&#8208;level alignment and the inhibition of ion migration are also demonstrated. Therefore, the AGS&#8208;modified devices exhibit a high efficiency of 22.22%, with superior operational stability.








Abstract
The substitution of organic cations with inorganic Cs+ in metal halide perovskites provides a broad chance for the development of high&#8208;performance tandem solar cells due to excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgaps of inorganic perovskites. However, the buried interface that governs interfacial charge transport and initialization of perovskite film crystallization is often overlooked due to difficulties in tailoring it. Herein, a strategy of modifying TiO2 surface with 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminobutyl) guanidine sulfate (AGS) is proposed to tackle these issues. It is found that the introduction of AGS induces in situ formation of PbSO4 dots and interaction with perovskite precursors, which rigorously regulate the crystallization of inorganic perovskite, featuring fast nucleation and acceleration of the phase transition process. This results in more uniform films, enlarged grain size, with reduced defects. The modified buried interface exhibits alleviated strain, suppressed ion migration, fewer voids, and better contact. Together with improved interfacial energy level match between perovskite and TiO2, the power conversion efficiency of modified inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) increases from 19.84% to 22.22%, with a voltage deficit of only 0.44&#160;V. Furthermore, PSCs still maintain 91.5% of its initial value after continuous operation at maximum power point tracking and illumination for 800&#160;h.

         <title>Programmable Continuous Electrowetting of Liquid Metal for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a programmable continuous electrowetting (CEW) approach for the dynamic manipulation of liquid metal (LM), enabling directional control via electrochemical modulation. By leveraging laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) substrates, a wide range of utilities is demonstrated, including fluidic &#8220;valves,&#8221; logic gates, and reconfigurable circuits. This approach contributes to the development of next&#8208;generation reconfigurable electronics and digital fluidic systems.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of the shape and position of liquid metal (LM), a conductive and deformable conductor, presents new opportunities for reconfigurable electronics, fluidic logic, and soft&#8208;actuation systems. This study combines continuous electrowetting (CEW) with electrochemical modulation of the interface of LM in electrolyte to achieve tunable and directional LM manipulation in 2D spaces. A key finding is that under a fixed external electric field, the LM moves in a direction that depends on its electrochemical potential. The LM potential is controlled using a substrate featuring patterns of laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) since it is non&#8208;wetting to LM and electrically conductive. This strategy enables a range of functionalities, including &#8220;valves&#8221; for on&#8208;demand LM control, LM droplet sorting, feedback sensing, and fluidic logic gates. The strategy can also control the motion of LM droplets across 2D spaces. Finally, it is utilized within a reconfigurable circuit platform where the LM functions as a dynamic interconnect for sequential activation, parallel switching, and self&#8208;healing circuits. By coupling the electrically&#8208;driven motion of LM and the versatility of LIG patterning, this work establishes a versatile framework for reconfigurable electronics, programmable fluidic systems, and adaptive systems.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Preparation of Ethyl Cellulose Films with Asymmetric Graded Pores for Low Dielectric Printing Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Niu et&#160;al. present a one&#8208;step preparation method for ethyl cellulose asymmetric porous films with dense skins based on the dry phase inversion technique and breath figure phenomenon. The entire pore&#8208;forming process is completed using only ethanol and water. The porous film's relative permittivity can be significantly reduced to 2.02 (6 GHz) and is suitable for Sub&#8208;6GHz printing radio frequency substrate.








Abstract
The innovation of communication technology and the proliferation of the Internet of Things have propelled the exploitation and application of mid&#8208;to&#8208;low end and disposable radio frequency devices, alongside the development of low dielectric materials. Traditional petroleum&#8208;based low dielectric substrates, led by polyimide, present several challenges, including higher cost, non&#8208;renewability, difficulty in disposal and recycling, rendering them unsuitable for disposable applications. In this study, the asymmetric ethyl cellulose (EC) porous film with dense skins is prepared in one step by the evaporation process of EC/ethanol/H2O solution. The synergistic pore&#8208;forming mechanism of the dry phase inversion technique and breath figure&#160;phenomenon is proposed based on EC pore morphology. The relative permittivity of the asymmetric EC porous film is 2.02 &#177; 0.03 (6&#160;GHz), demonstrating satisfactory dielectric stability, printing adaptability, and bending ability. The EC in discarded printed antennas and remnants from the film&#8208;making process can be separated and recovered through a simple dissolution and centrifugation process. The green and simple preparation process, extremely low manufacturing cost, excellent recyclability, and potential roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll process adaptability make asymmetric EC porous film highly competitive in the mid&#8208;to&#8208;low end and disposable centimetre wave radio frequency device substrate fields.

         <title>Surface Segregation Reconstructing Alloy Substrate for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid 1&#8208;min surface segregation strategy reconstructs Cu&#8211;Sn alloy substrates, effectively regulating Zn deposition behavior and suppressing side reactions. The optimized anode achieves 5400&#8208;h cycling in zinc&#8208;based pouch cells, offering a promising route for stable aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries via surface reconstruction.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (AZBs) are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their high safety, low cost, and eco&#8208;friendliness, but uncontrolled dendrite growth, low zinc (Zn) utilization, and resulting reduced energy density hinder their practical applications. Inert current collectors alleviate partial issues from excessive Zn loading, yet commercial metal foils suffer from rolling defects and localized Zn deposition. This work proposes a segregation strategy that induces directional inward tin (Sn) atom migration in copper&#8208;tin (Cu&#8211;Sn) alloy substrates via diffusion rate disparity by a 1&#8208;min heating process, forming a reconstructed surface that facilitates uniform Zn deposition. This reconstruction establishes triple synergistic optimization, including reducing nucleation barriers by exposing Cu (111) facets, creating uniform voids and CuO particles for homogeneous Zn nucleation, and eliminating rolling defects to enable dense Zn deposition. Based on these synergistic effects, the asymmetric cell exhibits exceptional cycling stability over &#8776;10&#160;000 cycles with 99.8% Coulombic efficiency. Zn&#8211;I2 coin cells achieve ultra&#8208;stable 40&#160;000 cycles, while pouch cells exhibit ultra&#8208;long 5000&#8208;h cycling stability with a 91% capacity retention rate, demonstrating superior stability for practical applications. Combining efficiency, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and scalability, this work provides a critical pathway for sustainable development and potential commercialization of AZBs.

         <title>Promoting Electrochemical Reactions with Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Rate Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable strategy for synthesizing transition metal&#8211;bismuth atomic pairs on carbon nitride to accelerate sulfur redox reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries is presented. Nickel&#8208;bismuth and cobatl&#8208;bismuth catalysts improve rate performance by promoting direct electrochemical transitions and rapid Li2S nucleation, minimizing sulfur loss, and enhancing stability.








Abstract
Sulfur cathodes offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable energy storage. However, their practical application is limited by sluggish and complex multistep sulfur redox reactions (SRRs), involving both electrochemical and chemical processes. Herein, it is demonstrated that accelerating electrochemical processes, particularly Li2S nucleation, over competing chemical pathways is fundamental to minimizing sulfur loss and achieving high&#8208;rate performance. To this end, a scalable and cost&#8208;effective strategy is presented for synthesizing a series of 3d transition metal&#8211;bismuth (TM&#8211;Bi) atomic pairs anchored on carbon nitride (CN) and investigate their potential to activate SRRs in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). An initial screening identifies Ni&#8211;Bi/CN and Co&#8211;Bi/CN as highly effective in improving rate performance. Detailed analysis shows these catalysts promote direct electrochemical transitions and rapid Li2S nucleation over competing chemical reactions, enabling high charge&#8211;discharge rates while preventing active material loss and enhancing stability. Electrochemical analysis, density functional theory, and operando spectroscopy reveal that TM&#8208;Bi pairing shifts d&#8208;band states closer to the Fermi level and modulates HOMO&#8211;LUMO levels, promoting lithium polysulfide (LiPS) interaction and facilitating efficient charge transfer. These findings offer valuable insights for designing advanced catalysts for LSBs and broader electrocatalytic applications.

         <title>Control of Effective Elastomer Density Enables Mechanically Robust and High&#8208;Efficiency Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective elastomer density (De) is introduced as a unified descriptor linking elastomer structure to device performance. A critical De enables optimal balance between efficiency and stretchability. At critical De, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells achieved an initial power conversion efficiency of 14.3% with 80% retention at 30.6% strain, representing the highest performance reported for elastomer&#8211;plasticized IS&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are highly promising for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. The incorporation of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) provides a cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical compliance. However, the influence of TPE structural diversity on device performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, the concept of effective elastomer density (De) is introduced as a unified molecular descriptor to quantitatively evaluate how elastomer structures affect IS&#8208;OSC morphology and functionality. It is demonstrated that increasing De enhances stretchability by inducing domain coarsening and surface roughening in amorphous regions, but simultaneously prolongs exciton lifetimes and suppresses charge extraction and transport. Notably, IS&#8208;OSCs achieve an optimal balance at a critical De of 1.5 mol&#160;m&#8722;3, delivering a high initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.3% and retaining 80% of the initial PCE at 30.6% strain, representing the best performance reported to date for IS&#8208;OSCs employing the elastomer&#8208;plasticization strategy.

     alt="Control of Effective Elastomer Density Enables Mechanically Robust and High-Efficiency Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effective elastomer density (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) is introduced as a unified descriptor linking elastomer structure to device performance. A critical &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; enables optimal balance between efficiency and stretchability. At critical &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells achieved an initial power conversion efficiency of 14.3% with 80% retention at 30.6% strain, representing the highest performance reported for elastomer&#8211;plasticized IS-OSCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS-OSCs) are highly promising for next-generation wearable electronics. The incorporation of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) provides a cost-effective strategy to improve mechanical compliance. However, the influence of TPE structural diversity on device performance has been largely overlooked. In this work, the concept of effective elastomer density (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) is introduced as a unified molecular descriptor to quantitatively evaluate how elastomer structures affect IS-OSC morphology and functionality. It is demonstrated that increasing &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; enhances stretchability by inducing domain coarsening and surface roughening in amorphous regions, but simultaneously prolongs exciton lifetimes and suppresses charge extraction and transport. Notably, IS-OSCs achieve an optimal balance at a critical &lt;i&gt;D&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; of 1.5 mol&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, delivering a high initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.3% and retaining 80% of the initial PCE at 30.6% strain, representing the best performance reported to date for IS-OSCs employing the elastomer-plasticization strategy. This descriptor-based framework provides a predictive and generalizable guideline for the molecular design of elastomers in stretchable optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Doping and Conjugation&#8208;Extension Enable Ultrahigh&#8208;Bright Full&#8208;Color Carbon Quantum Dots for Tunable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers and 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;bright full&#8208;color fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are synthesized via a single&#8208;precursor system, achieving photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) approaching 100% (hereafter referred to as unity&#8208;CQDs). These unity&#8208;CQDs exhibit superior liquid&#8208;state laser performance compare to the widely used organic dye, Rhodamine B. The enclosed area of the CIE color coordinates for the laser spectra of these unity&#8208;CQDs covers 152.6% of the NTSC color gamut. Furthermore, these unity&#8208;CQDs demonstrate excellent compatibility with various polymers, retaining their intense fluorescence even after thorough mixing. High&#8208;precision micro/nano 3D printing has been successfully achieved using these unity&#8208;CQDs, thereby confirming their micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale processability.








Abstract
Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) represent a novel solution&#8208;processable gain material with significant potential to replace conventional nano&#8208;luminescent materials such as organic molecules, quantum dots, and perovskites. However, the relatively low fluorescence brightness (FB) and photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) have hindered their widespread adoption. In this study, pyrene is used as the sole precursor to introduce various heteroatom dopants, and followed by solvothermal treatment to synthesize blue&#8208;, green&#8208;, and red&#8208;emissive CQDs with PLQYs approaching 100% (referred to as &#8220;unity&#8208;CQDs&#8221;). The FBs of these CQDs are all approximately 2 million. Pure unity&#8208;CQDs directly emit quasi&#8208;single&#8208;mode blue, green, and red lasers in a simple mirrorless pumping system that covers an area equivalent to 152.6% of the National Television Standards Committee (NTSC) standard color gamut. These lasers exhibit significantly higher Q&#8208;factors, higher gain coefficients, superior stabilities, and lower thresholds than those of Rhodamine B. Additionally, unity&#8208;CQDs demonstrate single&#8208;photon and two&#8208;photon excitation bright fluorescent imaging in biological staining. Furthermore, they can be combined with various polymer materials for solid&#8208;state vivid fluorescence applications including flexible high&#8208;transparent films, textiles, artwares, and high&#8208;precise micron&#8208;scale 3D printings. The research findings presented herein will contribute significantly toward the development and practical utilization of multicolor CQDs exhibiting ultra&#8208;high PLQYs and FBs.

         <title>Passively Ultra Cooling Patch Enabling High&#8208;Efficiency Power&#8208;Water Cogeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photovoltaics are the most viable solar energy technology. This work introduces an ultra&#8208;cooling patch (UCP) for passive thermal management of PV, achieving a 28% increase in power density and a water production rate of 2.2 L day&#8722;1. The enhancement results from the aligned channels and configurable heat transfer pathways of the UCP, which significantly improve thermal dissipation performance.








Abstract
Photovoltaic (PV) systems, which accounted for 75% of global renewable energy capacity in 2023, are limited by the substantial waste heat generated through the photothermal effect, reducing both electricity generation efficiency and panel longevity. In this work, a passive cooling strategy using an ultra&#8208;cooling patch (UCP) that effectively cools down the PV panel is presented, thus achieving an exceptionally high cooling power of nearly 700&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and facilitating the recovery of over 70% of waste heat for freshwater production. The flexibility and adhesive properties of UCP allow for easy integration with various PV configurations, including flexible panels. In addition, the UCP can be easily reconfigured into a fined structure, enabling modifications to the heat transfer pathway. This passively intensifies the heat dissipation of the PV panel, further enhancing the cooling performance. As a result, a remarkable temperature reduction of 29&#160;&#176;C for the PV panel is achieved, which in turn results in an impressive increase in maximum power density of over 28%. Moreover, outdoor experiments on a &#8776;1&#160;m2 PV panel validated the cooling performance and practical applicability. This study offers a solution with commercial potential to relieve the energy&#8208;water crisis, owing to its high efficiency, scalability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;mimetic fluorescent polymer is constructed through Cu2&#8314; chelation, exhibiting conformational transition, fluorescence quenching, and self&#8208;folding encapsulation properties. Under GSH&#8208;triggered reductive conditions, it enables FRET&#8208;mediated visualization of drug release, alongside dual enzymatic activity for tumor imaging. 








Abstract
Metal ion&#8208;mediated redox process and protein folding are fundamental to numerous physiological functions. However, the mechanisms underlying copper ion interactions with macromolecules remain insufficiently understood, and the therapeutic potential of polymer&#8208;copper complexes is largely underexplored. Here, a biomimetic metallopolymer is reported in which copper ion coordination induces a conformational transition from &#946;&#8208;sheet to &#945;&#8208;helix, accompanied by oxidative self&#8208;encapsulation and fluorescence quenching. By leveraging the tunable intrinsic fluorescence of the polymer, the first systematic elucidation of the coordination interaction mechanism between polythiols and copper ions is presented. This interaction enhances the structural stability, catalytic efficiency, membrane activity, and drug loading capacity. Furthermore, the polymer&#8208;copper complex demonstrates tumor&#8208;activated fluorescence and dual enzyme&#8208;mimetic activities, enabling precise tumor imaging and multimodal therapeutic efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. This work provides new insights into the interactions between macromolecules and metal ions and establishes a versatile and intelligent nanosystem for advanced disease diagnostics and therapeutics.

         <title>3D Spatiotemporal Electrophysiology of Cardiac Organoids Using Shell Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D spatiotemporal activation and conduction velocity mapping of whole cardiac organoids of various sizes is demonstrated using a novel organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell microelectrode array (MEA). The device's programmable shape transformation enables noninvasive, conformal, and stable contact with suspended organoids, facilitating long&#8208;term electrophysiological monitoring with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. The shell MEA is optically transparent and fabricated entirely on&#8208;chip using standard photolithographic techniques, enabling simultaneous optical imaging and scalable high&#8208;throughput manufacturing.








Abstract
Cardiac organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human heart development and disease. However, traditional 2D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are limited to planar recordings and fail to capture the 3D propagation of electrical signals. Here, programmable, shape&#8208;adaptive, organoid&#8208;encapsulating shell MEAs are presented as a technology that enables comprehensive 3D electrophysiological mapping. These on&#8208;chip&#8208;fabricated devices feature customizable geometries and electrode layouts tailored to an organoid's unique morphology. Shell MEAs generate high&#8208;resolution 3D isochrone and conduction velocity maps, unveiling long&#8208;term spatiotemporal field potential dynamics in spontaneously beating organoids. Furthermore, they integrate multiple modalities, such as&#160;calcium imaging&#160;to corroborate electrophysiological findings and pharmacological screening to assess organoid responses to isoproterenol, E&#8208;4031, and serotonin. This platform represents a significant advance in bioelectronic interfaces, enabling high&#8208;content 3D spatiotemporal functional analysis for cardiac disease modeling and pharmacological testing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiac organoids have emerged as powerful platforms for modeling human heart development and disease. However, traditional 2D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are limited to planar recordings and fail to capture the 3D propagation of electrical signals. Here, programmable, shape-adaptive, organoid-encapsulating shell MEAs are presented as a technology that enables comprehensive 3D electrophysiological mapping. These on-chip-fabricated devices feature customizable geometries and electrode layouts tailored to an organoid's unique morphology. Shell MEAs generate high-resolution 3D isochrone and conduction velocity maps, unveiling long-term spatiotemporal field potential dynamics in spontaneously beating organoids. Furthermore, they integrate multiple modalities, such as&#160;calcium imaging&#160;to corroborate electrophysiological findings and pharmacological screening to assess organoid responses to isoproterenol, E-4031, and serotonin. This platform represents a significant advance in bioelectronic interfaces, enabling high-content 3D spatiotemporal functional analysis for cardiac disease modeling and pharmacological testing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photodegradable, Self&#8208;Healing, and Soft&#8208;Tough Transparent Elastomers Via Zinc Coordination for Transient Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paper written by Ni and coworkers reports an effective molecular design strategy for simultaneously achieving excellent mechanical strength, toughness, softness, self&#8208;healing, and photodegradation of elastomers, which is highly desired for soft transient electronics applications. As a proof of concept, the resultant Zn&#8208;MDPU film is combined with liquid metal to construct a stretchable conductor for signal sensing.








Abstract
Transient electronics have emerged as a promising way to mitigate electronic pollution. However, developing soft transient electronics with practical potential to recover mechanical properties, restore sensing signals during operation, and rapidly vanish under specific external stimulation remains challenging. Herein, a molecular design strategy is proposed based on Zn2&#8314;&#8208;coordinated oxime&#8208;carbamate groups to simultaneously enhance mechanical strength, toughness, self&#8208;healing, and photodegradation performance in soft polyurethane elastomers (Zn&#8208;MDPU). Compared with MDPU elastomers without Zn2+ coordination interactions, the mechanical strength and toughness of Zn&#8208;MDPU elastomers are enhanced 3.8&#8208; and 16&#8208;fold, respectively, without any deterioration in their softness. The Zn2+ ions facilitate both the dynamic exchange of oxime&#8208;carbamate units, to enable efficient self&#8208;healing at room temperature, and the homolytic scission of weak N&#9472;O bonds within these groups for photodegradation. Application of Zn&#8208;MDPU elastomers coated with liquid metal is demonstrated through a patterned flexible transient conductor for human&#8211;machine interaction and health monitoring, along with the development of a self&#8208;healing triboelectric nanogenerator for mechanical energy harvesting. The proposed molecular design strategy opens vast possibilities for developing soft transient materials for wearable electronics applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Water&#8208;Based Metamaterial Absorber for Ultrabroadband Radar Stealth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, a biomimetic water&#8208;based metamaterial absorber is proposed. Simulation and experiments show that the absorber has properties of ultra&#8208;broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, can be used for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by the hierarchical porous architecture of Pachliopta aristolochiae butterfly wings and leveraging the intrinsic dielectric dispersion of water, it proposes a biomimetic water&#8208;based metamaterial absorber. Breaking conventional compactness&#8208;bandwidth trade&#8208;offs, this work integrates aqueous metamaterials with bio&#8208;inspired architecture, combining butterfly&#8208;derived hierarchical porosity and water's dielectric dispersion to achieve unprecedented microwave absorption. The absorber employs hexagonal water cavities in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix, mimicking butterfly&#8208;wing multiscale pores to extend wave paths through cascaded resonances. Water serves as &#8220;artificial melanin,&#8221; enabling tunable dielectric loss via molecular relaxation, with absorption dynamically adjusted through water column height/temperature for frequency&#8208;shifting and bandwidth broadening. The centrosymmetric geometry ensures polarization insensitivity and wide&#8208;angle stability. Optimized aqueous unit coupling achieves &gt;95% experimentally verified absorption (17.11&#8211;35.74&#160;GHz) and &gt;10&#160;dB simulated radar cross section (RCS) reduction. Experimental validation shows that the measured absorptivity is in high agreement with the simulation results. Unlike rigid multilayered alternatives, this water&#8208;PDMS architecture offers optical transparency, flexibility, and inherent fluidic tunability for functional reconfiguration. With advantages in ultra&#8208;broadband performance, angular stability, and scalable fabrication, the proposed absorber opens new avenues for adaptive camouflage, electromagnetic shielding, and multispectral stealth technologies.

         <title>Electrochemically Cation&#8208;Induced Three&#8208;Phase Conversion for Consecutively Tunable Electromagnetic Wave Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A device with a sandwich&#8208;structured configuration of metal mesh@HxWO3/H2SO4/hollow graphite is designed, in which an electrochemically cation&#8208;induced three phase conversion in HxWO3 could dynamically modify the electrical structure of HxWO3 and create a mass of dipoles by the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations in the host structure, thereby enhancing the overall dynamic response capabilities of electromagnetic wave.








Abstract
Tunable electromagnetic wave responses are increasingly attracting attention in the realm of integrated electronics. However, the modulation flexibility and reliability are limited in the current electromagnetic shielding materials. In this study, a device with a sandwich&#8208;structured configuration of metal mesh@HxWO3/H2SO4/hollow graphite is designed to enable dynamic response and precise control for electromagnetic waves (EMWs). In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical simulation revealed that the electrochemically controlled cation intercalation preferentially triggers the reversible conversion of HxWO3 from the monoclinic phase (M&#8208;phase) to the tetragonal phase (T&#8208;phase), and subsequently to the cubic phase (C&#8208;phase) by voltage management, which leads to a successive increase in valence electrons and enhancement in conductivity for precisely modulating reflection shielding efficiency of the incident EMWs. Furthermore, the intercalation and accumulation of the external cations produce a mass of dipoles in the crystal HxWO3 host structure, which further enhances the dielectric performances of materials and the dissipation capability of incident EMWs, and thus improves the electromagnetic absorption shielding effectiveness. Consequently, the outstanding modulation capability &#916;: 42.36 dB) and consecutively tunable intensity (from 10.98 to 53.34 dB) of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness is realized, which provides a more remarkable technology for adapting to demanding environments through the dynamical regulation of EMWs.

         <title>Without Contact Resistance, Proteins in Thin&#8208;Film Solid&#8208;State Junctions Can Be Efficient Electronic Conducting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that contact resistance is effectively eliminated in two&#8208;probe micropore device metal/protein/metal bioelectronic junctions. These results, using two different protein types in these junctions, show that, as ultrathin (&lt;40 nm) films, proteins are an even more efficient electronic transport medium than previously thought, when the contact resistance is still included in measurements.








Abstract
The solid&#8208;state protein junctions have shown efficient electron transport over a few tens of nanometer lengthscale. This work demonstrates, how the contact resistance (RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$) of a solid&#8208;state protein junctions, treated as a contact&#8208;limited process, which can be extracted quantitatively from the measured junction resistance (RP) by using the extrapolated zero&#8208;length resistance and series resistance (RS). Alternating current (impedance spectroscopy) and direct current measurements are used to examine charge transport in junctions of human serum albumin (HSA) and bacteriorhodopsin (bR) films with varying thicknesses. Three contact configurations, Si&#8211;Au, Au&#8211;eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn), and, in a micropore device (MpD), Au&#8211;Pd, are compared. While Si&#8211;Au and Au&#8211;EGaIn junctions exhibit substantial RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$ that are ascribed to interfacial oxides and electrostatic protein&#8211;electrode interactions, MpD effectively eliminates RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, enabling measuring the intrinsic electron transport across HSA and bR films. The exponential length&#8208;dependence of RP shows a transport decay constant (&#946;) that varies with interfacial conditions, underscoring the role of contact engineering. By minimizing RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, exceptionally low &#946; values (&#8776;0.7&#8211;1.1 nm&#8722;1) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.

By minimizing RC&#770;$\widehat {{R_{\mathrm{C}}}}$, exceptionally low &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; values (&#8776;0.7&#8211;1.1 nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) are found, proving that, indeed, proteins can have outstanding charge transport efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Activable Photosensitizer for Sunshine&#8208;Driven Photodynamic Therapy Against Multiple&#8208;Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria by Exploiting Macrophage Chemotaxis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
There has been a vision of conducting therapy using sunlight since the beginning of human civilization. This study develops a novel photodynamic therapy paradigm that, for the first time, uses sunlight to treat bacterial infections. It provides a simple, safe, and effective treatment for systemic bacterial infections in immunocompromised hosts, achieving a 100% cure rate in mouse and rabbit models. 








Abstract
Aiming to improve photodynamic therapy (PDT)&#160;safety and specificity at the in vivo level, a new concept is proposed by combining the chemotaxis and circulating ability of macrophages with the controllable therapeutic efficiency of PDT. Moreover, an irradiation strategy is utilized of sunbathing to conduct PDT. Specifically, an inflammation&#8208;activable photosensitizer (Lyso710A) based on NIR BODIPY is designed and loaded it into macrophages. These &#8220;armed&#8221; macrophages are then transferred into the infected host to capture bacteria and transport them to the surface of the skin through blood circulation, where sunlight can penetrate. Upon capturing bacteria, the photodynamic effect of Lyso710A is turned on by the macrophage's endogenous hypochlorous acid (HClO). When these macrophages reach the epidermis, the bacteria are eradicated by the photodynamic effect of the activated photosensitizer during exposure to sunlight. Furthermore, this strategy demonstrates promising therapeutic efficacy in two animal models (mouse and rabbit) with systemic bacterial infection, using a low photosensitizer dose of 0.14&#160;mg&#160;Kg&#8722;1 in animals. This work demonstrates an intelligent and promising approach to breaking the routine of PDT and, for the first time, executing PDT for deep&#8208;tissue bacterial infection simply by bathing in the sunshine.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Multiphase Engineering Enables Superior Broadband Infrared Emissivity in High&#8208;Entropy Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By harnessing entropy&#8208;driven phase engineering in high&#8208;entropy spinel oxides, three crystalline phases are stabilized into a robust multiphase network. This engineered architecture introduces abundant defects, interfacial mismatches, and localized strain, which narrow the bandgap and enhance carrier excitation, yielding near&#8208;blackbody emissivity across 0.78&#8211;16 &#181;m &#8212; ideal for next&#8208;generation radiative thermal management applications.








Abstract
Efficient infrared (IR) thermal management is crucial for advanced industrial and aerospace heat management. However, achieving stable, broadband emissivity across 0.78&#8211;16&#160;&#181;m, particularly at high temperatures, remains challenging. Herein, an entropy&#8208;driven phase&#8208;engineering strategy is presented that enables synergistic enhancement of broadband IR emissivity in high&#8208;entropy spinel oxides. By systematically tuning La doping, controlled coexistence of three intimately coupled crystalline phases is achieved. Multi&#8208;scale structural and atomic&#8208;level analyses reveal dense phase boundaries, abundant defects, and pronounced lattice strains, which together induce bandgap narrowing and facilitate efficient free carrier transitions in the short&#8208;wavelength IR regime. Simultaneously, the intricate network of phase interfaces and local lattice disorders intensifies phonon vibrations, resulting in enhanced lattice vibration absorption in the mid&#8208;to&#8208;long wavelength region. Consequently, the multiphase oxide achieves a robust emissivity of 0.91 across 0.78&#8211;16&#160;&#181;m and retains high performance after prolonged exposure to 900 &#176;C. When applied as coatings, even higher emissivity (up to 0.95) and excellent mechanical durability are achieved. Compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art emitters, these entropy&#8208;stabilized ceramics uniquely integrate broadband high emissivity, thermal stability, and mechanical robustness. The findings provide fundamental insights into entropy&#8208;enabled multiphase synergy and establish a framework for next&#8208;generation radiative thermal management materials in extreme environments.

         <title>Giant Circular Dichroism in Proximitized WS2 Spin&#8208;Valley Transistors for Complementary Optoelectronics and Reconfigurable Logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
WS2&#8208;based spin&#8208;valley transistors are developed with notable circular dichroic photocurrent, benefited from the proximity coupling from magnetic substrates and spin&#8208;selectivity of spin tunneling electrodes. Complementary phototransistors can be developed by reversing the spin polarization of magnets. These devices are used to build reconfigurable optoelectronic NOT, NAND, and NOR gates for optical switching and all&#8208;optical computing applications.








Abstract
The coupling of valley and spin degrees of freedom in 2D materials holds significant promise for advancing novel device applications. In this study, a highly polarized spin&#8208;valley transistor based on the circular dichroic photocurrent in WS2 is demonstrated. By integrating highly spin&#8208;selective tunneling spin detectors and leveraging the magnetic proximity effect of spin&#8208;polarized substrates, the spin degeneracy in optical transition and spin transport can be broken. A giant photocurrent polarization of 41.90% is realized at room temperature under ultraviolet light irradiation. Interestingly, the sign of the circular dichroism can be reversed by switching the magnetization of substrates and electrodes, showing an opposite resistance state under circularly polarized light. This device has removed the hurdle for developing complementary phototransistors (as they are always in low&#8208;resistance states under light illumination), which are further exploited to construct reconfigurable logic gates. The findings will pave the way for new developments in optical couplers and on&#8208;chip optical computing technologies.

         <title>Adaptive and Multifunctional Emulsion Solar Evaporators with High Operating Stability in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;like Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed for the first time, which enables continuous, stable, and ultrahigh&#8208;rate water evaporation under harsh conditions, including oil contamination, high salinity, and bacteria, while offering self&#8208;cleaning, pollutant degradation, and recyclability. This multifunctional and adaptable platform provides a transformative solution for sustainable clean water production in complex environments.








Abstract
Global water scarcity and pollution demand innovative solutions for sustainable clean water production. While interfacial solar evaporation holds great promise, current evaporators face significant challenges in achieving stable clean water&#160;productivity under harsh conditions. Here, a highly adaptive, liquid&#8208;like, multifunctional Pickering emulsion solar evaporator is developed, which can be formed in situ on oil&#8208;contaminated water or preconstructed with optimized rheological properties for flexible and scalable deployment. The resulting emulsion evaporator exhibits multidirectional water transport pathways, enhanced thermal localization, controllable salt deposition, and gravity&#8208;assisted self&#8208;cleaning capabilities. During operation, this evaporator can actively integrate oil contaminants into its emulsion structure without compromising efficiency, while inhibiting salt accumulation, realizing stable, long&#8208;term ultrahigh&#8208;rate evaporation (12.5&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) even in hypersaline (26&#160;wt.%) conditions under elevated solar irradiation intensity (11 kW cm&#8722;2). It also degrades organic pollutants (e.g., nearly 100% phenol removal), deactivates bacteria, and prevents biofouling. Its phase transformation capability enables easy recovery and recycling, further enhancing practicality and sustainability. This study overcomes the limitations of conventional solid&#8208;state solar evaporators, offering a versatile platform for clean water production in challenging environments.

         <title>Photogenerated Carrier Reconstructed Ion Concentration Gradients for Moisture Electricity Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a photon moisture electricity generator (P&#8208;MEG) that leverages a coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects to reconstruct the ion concentration gradient under illumination, effectively addressing ion saturation and enhancing the long&#8208;term stability of moisture&#8208;based energy harvesters.








Abstract
Although moisture electricity generators (MEG), which enable conversion of atmospheric moisture into electricity, have attracted great attention, the long&#8208;term moisture absorption of MEG leads to the saturation of ion concentration gradient and the decreased ion migration rate, seriously reducing the output performance. In this work, this bottleneck of MEG is addressed by constructing a photon moisture electricity generator (P&#8208;MEG) with a photosensitive layer electrode, and the synergistic coupling of photovoltaic and hydrovoltaic effects is realized. The photogenerated carriers in photosensitive layer convert H+ on the photosensitive layer into H2, resulting in a reconstructed H+ concentration gradient between the two electrodes of P&#8208;MEG. The direct detection of H2 by gas chromatography and the increase of the pH from 0.26 to 2.11 under illumination both prove the H+ gradient reconstruction mechanism. The results show that under 80% relative humidity (RH), the illumination increases the P&#8208;MEG output voltage from 0.55 to 0.65&#160;V the current density from 17.5 to 34.5&#160;&#181;A&#160;cm&#8722;2, and the power density from 8.26 to 26.7 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. Present work provides a strategy to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of MEG devices.

         <title>Structural Phase Separation and Enhanced Superconductivity in La1.875Ba0.125CuO4 Under Uniaxial Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniaxial strain is used to tune electronic, structural, and magnetic order in a copper oxide superconductor. Application of a moderate uniaxial strain condition across the low&#8208;temperature orthorhombic&#8208;to&#8208;tetragonal transition creates a condition that disrupts the usual stripe ordering. The result is phase separation into three distinct structural phases, characterized by enhanced superconducting transition temperatures.








Abstract
Strain engineering has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its capability in tuning lattice and electronic structures of quantum materials. Using moderate uniaxial compressive strain, structural phase separation is induced in the low&#8208;temperature phase of x = 1/8 La2&#8722;xBaxCuO4$\rm La_{2-x}Ba_{x}CuO_{4}$ (LBCO) single crystals. These structures are low temperature tetragonal (LTT), low temperature less orthorhombic (LTLO), and a plastically deformed nano&#8208;domain structure (PDNS), comprised of few&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized orthorhombic domains within an amorphous matrix. These three structures exhibit distinct superconducting behaviors. The volume fraction of the LTT structure is suppressed with increasing strain, while its superconducting transition temperature increases and broadens. The LTLO structure exhibits a sharp superconducting transition above 32&#160;K, which increases up to &#8776;&#8201;36&#160;K at maximum strain. The PDNS phase exhibits a very broad superconducting transition and persists even after removing the strain. This study illustrates the sensitivity of superconductivity to the structure of the LBCO sample near its stripe&#160;instability.

         <title>Mechanically Compliant and Impedance Matching Hydrogel Bioelectronics for Low&#8208;Voltage Peripheral Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel bioelectronics for low&#8208;voltage peripheral neuromodulation: Selfcurling hydrogel bioelectronics establish a multifunctional platform for lowvoltage peripheral neuromodulation, enabling tailored designs to accommodate diverse nerve curvatures through precise geometric optimization. These devices seamlessly integrate with neural tissues and are validated in a rat stroke model, demonstrating precise neuromodulation achieved via low&#8208;current stimulation.








Abstract
In neural biointerfacing technologies, mitigating the mismatch in mechanical and impedance attributes between neural tissues and bioelectronics remains a central challenge for achieving high&#8208;efficacy neuromodulation. Here, full&#8208;hydrogel bioelectronics that demonstrate superior mechanical compliance and impedance matching with 3D peripheral nerves, allowing for low&#8208;voltage vagus nerve stimulation, are reported. By precisely tuning the dimensional parameters through 3D printing, the hydrogel bioelectronics, initially in a 2D planar form in a dehydrated state, can curl spontaneously around nerves and form a seamless interface. During the hydration process, instant, and tough bioadhesion is achieved through a dry crosslinking mechanism, enabling a mechanically robust nerve&#8208;electrode interface to resist dynamic yet vigorous deformations of the peripheral nerve systems. The as&#8208;formed nerve&#8208;electrode interface significantly mitigates the impedance mismatch, in favor of electrical stimulation at a threshold voltage of 10 mV, one order of magnitude lower than that of conventional metallic electrodes. The use of the hydrogel bioelectronics for successful stroke rehabilitation through low&#8208;voltage vagus nerve stimulation in a rat model is also&#160;demonstrated.

         <title>Thermoresponsive Hydrogel with Thermal Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally plastic hydrogels (TP&#8208;gels) encode thermal history via temperature&#8208;dependent polymer&#8211;water miscibility; elastic networks store memory, and elasticity&#8208;constrained demixing actuates opacity. Unlike conventional thermoresponsive gels with a fixed critical temperature (Tc), TP&#8208;gels modulate Tc through thermal training, delivering programmable, equilibrium&#8208;driven phase behavior and swelling&#8208;history&#8208;dependent transitions.








Abstract
Thermal plasticity&#8212;the capacity to dynamically reconfigure material properties in response to thermal history&#8212;is a hallmark of biological systems that remains elusive in synthetic hydrogels. Inspired by coral symbiont acclimatization, thermally plastic hydrogels (TP&#8208;gels) based on polyvinyl butyral are reported, which emulate biological thermal memory through a bioinspired feedback loop: thermoresponsive equilibrium swelling encodes thermal history, while elastic network constraints translate this memory into programmable phase transition thresholds (Tc). By exploiting temperature&#8208;dependent polymer&#8208;water miscibility, TP&#8208;gels achieve multi&#8208;stable states through adaptive swelling, enabling reversible opacity transitions with Tc shifts of 3&#8211;7&#160;&#176;C per thermal training cycle. Crucially, elasticity&#8208;mediated suppression of spinodal decomposition stabilizes metastable states during thermal encoding, preventing premature phase separation. This plasticity is leveraged for cryptographic applications, demonstrating sequential information decryption via thermal trajectory programming&#8212;where spatially resolved&#160;Tc&#160;gradients serve as thermodynamic keys. This work establishes a paradigm for materials with embodied environmental intelligence, bridging the divide between biological adaptability and synthetic systems through thermodynamic metastability engineering.

         <title>Click Chemistry&#8208;Inspired Fixation Catalysis for Long&#8208;Life Zinc&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A click&#8208;inspired molecular catalyst enables both iodine fixation and dynamic redox catalysis in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries. The Fe&#8208;Cp catalyst forms robust Fe&#9472;I bonds and promotes axial electron transfer, suppressing shuttle effects and accelerating reaction kinetics. This dual mechanism delivers ultralong cycling stability and high&#8208;capacity pouch cells.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for high&#8208;performance and cost&#8208;effective energy storage, yet their practical deployment is hindered by severe polyiodide shuttling and limited redox kinetics. To overcome this bottleneck at its core, a molecular&#8208;level fixation catalysis strategy&#8212;inspired by click chemistry principles is presented&#8212;that transcends the limitations of conventional adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis. Inspired by the selectivity and efficiency of click reactions, a Cp(Fe(CO)2)2&#8208;derived molecular catalyst (Fe&#8208;Cp) is designed that forms directional and robust Fe&#9472;I coordination bonds, locking iodine species into stable Fe&#8208;CpI complexes. Beyond anchoring, Fe&#8208;Cp uniquely enables axial electron transfer, facilitating reversible charge redistribution and dynamic iodine redox conversion beyond the reach of surface&#8208;confined systems. This dual&#8208;function mechanism not only suppresses the polyiodide shuttle but also dynamically regulates the electron redistribution at the catalytic interface, fundamentally enhancing reaction kinetics. Benefiting from this design, the Zn&#8211;I2 batteries deliver an exceptional cycling lifespan of 63&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1 with 95% capacity retention and &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, even under a high mass loading of 20&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 in pouch Zn&#8211;I2 cells, the system maintains a high areal capacity of 3.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 and &#8776;100% capacity retention even after 2000 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;A click-inspired molecular catalyst enables both iodine fixation and dynamic redox catalysis in aqueous zinc-iodine batteries. The Fe-Cp catalyst forms robust Fe&#9472;I bonds and promotes axial electron transfer, suppressing shuttle effects and accelerating reaction kinetics. This dual mechanism delivers ultralong cycling stability and high-capacity pouch cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries are promising candidates for high-performance and cost-effective energy storage, yet their practical deployment is hindered by severe polyiodide shuttling and limited redox kinetics. To overcome this bottleneck at its core, a molecular-level fixation catalysis strategy&#8212;inspired by click chemistry principles is presented&#8212;that transcends the limitations of conventional adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis. Inspired by the selectivity and efficiency of click reactions, a Cp(Fe(CO)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived molecular catalyst (Fe-Cp) is designed that forms directional and robust Fe&#9472;I coordination bonds, locking iodine species into stable Fe-CpI complexes. Beyond anchoring, Fe-Cp uniquely enables axial electron transfer, facilitating reversible charge redistribution and dynamic iodine redox conversion beyond the reach of surface-confined systems. This dual-function mechanism not only suppresses the polyiodide shuttle but also dynamically regulates the electron redistribution at the catalytic interface, fundamentally enhancing reaction kinetics. Benefiting from this design, the Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries deliver an exceptional cycling lifespan of 63&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 95% capacity retention and &#8776;100% Coulombic efficiency. Remarkably, even under a high mass loading of 20&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in pouch Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells, the system maintains a high areal capacity of 3.3 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and &#8776;100% capacity retention even after 2000 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A simple and scalable kneading method using a roller machine is developed to fabricate a biodegradable and highly stretchable starch&#8208;based hydrogel featuring a multi&#8208;bond network structure for durable and multifunctional wearable electronics. The reversible crosslinking from hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with MXene nanosheets acting as stress&#8208;transfer centers, endow the hydrogel&#8208;based sensor with high sensitivity, broad sensing range, and excellent durability, allowing accurate detection of physiological signals.








Abstract
With the rapid advancement of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics, multifunctional hydrogels with an emphasis on environmental sustainability have attracted growing attention. In this work, a starch&#8208;based hydrogel featuring a multi&#8208;bond network structure&#8212;composed of amylopectin, polyvinyl alcohol, borax, and MXene nanosheets&#8212;is prepared via a simple, scalable kneading method using a roller machine. The reversible crosslinking from hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, along with MXene nanosheets acting as stress&#8208;transfer centers, endow the hydrogel with exceptional stretchability (&#8764;6151%), high electrical conductivity, fast self&#8208;healing, and strong adhesion. The resulting capacitive sensor exhibits high sensitivity (gauge factor = 1.1), a broad sensing range (up to 300%), and excellent durability, allowing accurate detection of physiological signals. It also enables Morse code&#8208;based encryption of letters, numbers, and punctuation, highlighting its potential in wearable and secure communication technologies. Notably, the hydrogel biodegrades in natural soil within 20 days, addressing electronic waste concerns. This study presents a recyclable, high&#8208;performance hydrogel with broad application prospects in flexible electronics, healthcare monitoring, and assistive communication.

         <title>Nano/Micro Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Derived Ceramics for Sustainable Energy Saving/Capturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;fired ceramics integrate MOF&#8208;derived hierarchical alumina particles within a glass matrix. This design achieves excellent solar reflectance and thermal emittance, enabling dual functions: building energy conservation and enhanced photovoltaic efficiency. This work advances large&#8208;scale production of passive radiative cooling materials for sustainable energy solutions, accelerating the global transition to climate&#8208;neutral infrastructure.








Abstract
To combat the global energy crisis, passive radiative cooling materials provide more sustainable solutions to save energy for cooling buildings and capture renewable energy for powering them. However, the design of passive radiative cooling materials is subject to a trade&#8208;off between solar reflectance and practicality. To overcome this dilemma, a low&#8208;temperature co&#8208;firing ceramic is reported that integrates hierarchically structured alumina particles&#8212;derived from nano/micro metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8212;within a glass matrix. These alumina particles enhance light backscattering by utilizing optimized geometric parameters and high porosity to achieve near&#8208;perfect solar reflectance (&gt;0.98), while the glass matrix ensures high long&#8208;wave infrared emittance (0.93). This synergy enables a maximum sub&#8208;ambient temperature reduction of 7.4&#160;&#176;C during the daytime and a midday short&#8208;circuit current boost of 10.46 mA. Global simulations project a net CO2 emission reduction of 1.43 billion metric tons through reducing cooling demands and enhancing photovoltaic output. Combined with robust mechanical strength (43 MPa), UV resistance (&gt;2000 h), superhydrophobicity (150&#176; water contact angle, maintaining an exceptional solar reflectance of 0.97), flame resistance (&gt;1000&#160;&#176;C tolerance), and near&#8208;100% recyclability, this low&#8208;cost and scalable ceramic provides an effective strategy to accelerate the global transition toward climate&#8208;neutral infrastructure.

         <title>Flexible and Dynamic Interfacial Desolvation in High&#8208;Entropy Electrolyte for Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy flexible electrolyte (HEFE) with imbalanced H2O coordination enables mixed Zn2+ solvation (Zn(H2O)m2+, m &#8804; 6) and disordered water networks, boosting ionic conductivity and suppressing H2 evolution. It achieves 3500 h Zn cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2 and, with I2@C cathodes, enables solid&#8211;solid redox (3600 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). The strategy also works for Mn2&#8314;, showing broad potential for multivalent batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are promising candidates beyond lithium&#8208;ion technologies, but the intrinsic hydrogen&#8208;down orientation of interfacial water under negative bias, together with ion depletion at the electrode surface, promotes inhomogeneous Zn plating and substantial hydrogen evolution. Here, a high&#8208;entropy flexible electrolyte (HEFE) is demonstrated that leverages the fast water&#8208;exchange kinetics of Li&#8314;, K&#8314;, and Cs&#8314;. By deliberately inducing cation&#8208;hydration disequilibrium, the HEFE forms flexible Zn(H2O)m2+ (m &#8804; 6) solvation structures embedded in a disordered water network, enhancing ionic conductivity and alleviating ion&#8208;transport limitations. Under cathodic bias, a progressive desolvation from Zn(H2O)62+ to Zn(H2O)x2+ (x &#8804; 5) proceeds while retaining aqueous disorder, thereby suppressing hydrogen evolution and enabling 3500 h of deep cycling at 1 mA cm&#8722;2/3 mAh cm&#8722;2. For iodine cathodes, the HEFE induces a pathway shift from the conventional I&#8722;&#8594;I2 route to a solid&#8211;solid (CsI&#8594;I2) conversion, fundamentally inhibiting iodide shuttling and extending full&#8208;cell life to 3600 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Beyond Zn, the solvation&#8208;heterogeneity strategy opens avenues for reversible multivalent electrochemistry and advancing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) Reaction Energy Barrier Regulation in Passive Film for Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate with Cr, enhancing the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film, and achieving excellent anode stability in industrial seawater electrolysis.








Abstract
Seawater electrolysis offers a promising route for green hydrogen production, but anode corrosion by chloride (Cl&#8722;) and bromide (Br&#8722;) ions hinders its practicality. Although effective catalyst modification strategies have been developed to mitigate Cl&#8722;&#8208;induced corrosion, the extensive spallation of the catalyst layer caused by accumulated Br&#8722; highlights the urgent need to address co&#8208;corrosion by both Br&#8722; and Cl&#8722;.

&lt;p&gt;A Ni-X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate with Cr, enhancing the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film, and achieving excellent anode stability in industrial seawater electrolysis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seawater electrolysis offers a promising route for green hydrogen production, but anode corrosion by chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and bromide (Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) ions hinders its practicality. Although effective catalyst modification strategies have been developed to mitigate Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-induced corrosion, the extensive spallation of the catalyst layer caused by accumulated Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; highlights the urgent need to address co-corrosion by both Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;. Here, a Ni-X (X = Cl, Br) reaction energy barrier modulation strategy is proposed by alloying the Ni substrate to enhance the corrosion resistance of the surface passive film. Theoretical simulations predict that NiCr alloy has substantial potential as an anode substrate. Experimental results further demonstrate that the unique passive film of NiCr can resist both Cl&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, with a much higher pitting potential compared to alternative materials, effectively preventing harmful Br&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;-induced lateral corrosion.

         <title>Chiral Noncovalent Peptide Glasses for Highly Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral noncovalent peptide glasses with high transparency, large size, and self&#8208;healing are constructed via an ambient supramolecular&#8208;coordination synergistic strategy. These glasses exhibit high and tunable circularly polarized luminescence (|glum| up to 0.29) and multi&#8208;modal encryption, paving the way for sustainable photonic security materials.








Abstract
Peptide&#8208;based noncovalent glasses exhibit natural origins, green synthesis conditions, and self&#8208;healing properties, representing a promising sustainable alternative to conventional glasses. However, developing chiral noncovalent peptide glasses with highly circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is still a challenging task. Herein, a supramolecular&#8208;coordination synergistic induced strategy is reported for constructing enantiomeric noncovalent peptide glasses from carnosine (Car) enantiomers and metal ions (Zn2+, Eu3+, Tb3+, Gd3+) under ambient conditions. The resulting chiral Car(M) peptide glasses not only exhibit high optical transparency (&gt;90%), large sizes, easily processable shapes, and high ambient self&#8208;healing performances, but also show programmable multicolor emission, chiral amplification, and full&#8208;spectrum CPL encoding. Due to the synergistic metal coordination and hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular interactions, the obtained chiral Car(M) glasses reveal record&#8208;high and tunable CPL with dissymmetry factors (|glum|) up to 0.29. Leveraging the high transparency and multicolor chiral emission of Car(M) glasses, an anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform is demonstrated including flexible multicolor QR codes, filter&#8208;resolved patterns, polarization&#8208;sensitive Morse codes, and programmable dot&#8208;array encryption. This work fabricates new chiral noncovalent peptide glasses that exhibit rapid self&#8208;healing capabilities and high, tunable CPL performance, thereby pioneering a novel avenue for chiral photonic applications.

         <title>Cooling Crystallization at Solid Interfaces en Route to a Janus Nanocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique RuNiW/W2C Janus structure are synthesized through a cooling crystallization strategy, serving as highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for urea assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrogen production via water electrolysis is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however replacing OER with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) provides a promising, energy&#8208;efficient alternative. The development of Janus electrocatalysts offers new opportunities to address the intrinsic complexity problem of the UOR, which involves multiple electron transfers. Here, a cooling crystallization strategy is reported, guided by carbophilicity differences, to synthesize multi&#8208;metallic RuNiW/W2C Janus nanoparticles as efficient catalysts for catalyzing the UOR. In the synthesis, W2C forms during the initial heating stage and serves as a substrate that promotes the exsolution and subsequent growth of the RuNiW phase upon cooling. This Janus electrocatalyst demonstrates outstanding bifunctional performance, requiring only 1.40&#160;V versus RHE for the UOR and an overpotential of 133&#160;mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, it enables urea&#8208;assisted electrolyzer to operate continuously for over 200 h. Both experiments and calculations confirm that the Janus structure effectively modulates the valence state of Ni component, optimizing urea adsorption and reducing the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. This work provides a new avenue for designing highly efficient Janus electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;PARPi Conjugates Delivering USP1i for Maximizing Synthetic Lethality to Stimulate STING Pathway in High&#8208;Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer</title>

         <dc:description>
A GSH&#8208;responsive nanoparticle co&#8208;delivering a USP1 inhibitor and Niraparib amplifies DNA damage and collapses homologous recombination repair. This strategy restores PARPi sensitivity, remodels the ovarian tumor microenvironment, and achieves strong synergy with immune checkpoint blockade, offering a translational nanomedicine solution for overcoming therapeutic resistance in high&#8208;grade serous ovarian cancer.








Abstract
Overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and therapeutic resistance remains a significant challenge in ovarian cancer treatment. In this study, a glutathione&#8208;responsive polymeric nanoparticle platform for the co&#8208;delivery of the USP1 inhibitor SJB3&#8208;019A and the PARP inhibitor Niraparib is developed. This system synergistically enhances DNA damage accumulation, suppresses homologous recombination repair, and robustly activate the STING signaling pathway, leading to enhanced type I interferon responses and mitigation of immune evasion. Mechanistically, USP1 inhibition significantly impairs DNA repair, amplifying the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibition and promoting immunogenic cell death. In vivo studies demonstrated precise, glutathione&#8208;responsive drug release and substantial tumor accumulation of the nanoparticles, resulting in remarkable antitumor efficacy in murine ovarian cancer models. Importantly, this combinational approach effectively remodels the tumor microenvironment by increasing CD8&#8314; T cell infiltration and enhancing tumor sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. This innovative strategy targeting DNA damage responses presents a promising platform for precise and effective ovarian cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Evaporation&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Function Wood Composites: Integrating Hydrovoltaic Generation and Thermal Management in Architectural Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a biomass dual&#8208;functional platform with chemically modified metasequoia wood, using vertical microchannels for concurrent power generation and evaporative cooling. The prototype cabin demonstrates stable performance in diverse scenarios, validated by practical tests for off&#8208;grid energy and cooling in sustainable architecture. 








Abstract
Natural materials, prized for their hierarchical microchannels, eco&#8208;friendliness, and low cost, show great promise for evaporation&#8208;driven power generation. Yet developing them into bifunctional platforms that simultaneously produce electricity and cooling remains an unmet challenge. This study demonstrates a biomass&#8208;based dual&#8208;functional platform using chemically modified metasequoia wood for concurrent electricity generation and evaporative cooling. The wood's vertically aligned microchannels enable anisotropic water transport, integrating carboxylation&#8208;modified structure with stainless steel electrodes to form a green energy device. In deionized water, it delivers &#8776;265.8 mV open&#8208;circuit voltage, &#8776;4.3 &#181;A short&#8208;circuit current, and a record &#8776;408 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2 power density&#8212;beyond state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomass harvesters constructed via interface engineering. Its stable, adaptable performance across environments is further enhanced by circuit integration. Under solar radiation, an energy&#8208;saving cabin prototype achieves &#8776;6.1 &#176;C cooling (&#8776;857.5 W&#160;m&#8722;2) and maintains &#8776;2.1 &#176;C night&#8208;time temperature reduction. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a metasequoia wood cabin prototype, generates power and cools simultaneously. Yangzhou tests show &#8776;1580&#8211;1630 mV output and &#8776;4.9&#160;&#176;C/1.1&#160;&#176;C day/night cooling, proving sustainable architecture viability. This work innovates sustainable energy&#8208;water technologies, enabling off&#8208;grid power and passive cooling for self&#8208;sufficient architectures.

         <title>Enhancing Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and Pollutant Adsorption in Advanced Oxidation Processes with Cation Vacancy&#8208;Driven Dual&#8208;Site Mn2SiO4 Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;driven dual active site Mn2SiO4 catalytic materials effectively activate reactive oxygen species and enhance pollutant adsorption, thereby achieving efficient oxidation degradation of recalcitrant pollutants.








Abstract
Catalytic advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising strategy for the near&#8208;complete mineralization of all&#8208;organic pollutants via the strong oxidizing power of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, practical implementation is hindered by the low ROS generation yield owing to insufficient catalytically active sites and ineffective utilization stemming from transient radical lifetimes. Herein, cation vacancy&#8208;engineered manganese silicate (V&#8208;Mn2SiO4) catalysts comprising dual reaction sites are presented, which enable the highly efficient oxidation of recalcitrant organic pollutants through the activation of peroxymonosulfate. Experimental results and density functional theory calculations confirm that Mn sites adjacent to vacancies serve as the primary active centers for peroxymonosulfate activation, whereas adjacent O sites facilitate pollutant adsorption. This dual&#8208;site configuration effectively lowers the activation energy barrier and enhances peroxymonosulfate activation and singlet oxygen (1O2) generation while optimizing the 1O2 migration distance via pollutant adsorption and enrichment. The rate constants of V&#8208;Mn2SiO4 against rhodamine B and 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol pollutants are 1.171 and 0.1291 min&#8722;1, respectively, which are comparable to those reported for atomically dispersed metal nanocatalysts in AOPs. This discovery marks a breakthrough in AOPs, accelerating their practical application in environmental remediation and advancing sustainable pollution control technologies.

         <title>Understanding the Zeta Potential in Regulating Zn Deposition Kinetics for Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work evaluates the effects of the Zeta potential (ZP) of oxide nanoparticles (ONPs, i.e., MgO, SiO2, Al2O3) on enhancing the cyclic stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). The screening principle for ONPs based on ZP is established when they are used in colloidal electrolytes. Specifically, the ZP&#8208;optimized SiO2 colloidal electrolyte (4Z&#8208;S) with the ZP of &#8722;28.6 mV enables rapid Zn deposition kinetics. The 4Z&#8208;S colloidal electrolyte exhibits a long&#8208;term life of 3400 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 for Zn anodes and a high capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles for a 145 mAh Zn||I2 pouch cell.








Abstract
Severe Zn2+ concentration polarization at the anode/electrolyte interface induces inhomogeneous electric field distribution on the Zn anode surface in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs), causing dendrite growth and formation of &#8220;dead zinc&#8221;. Colloidal electrolytes are used to regulate Zn plating/stripping behavior. However, there is a lack of systematic and fundamental understanding of the adsorption capacity of colloidal particles for Zn2+ and Zeta potential (ZP) in optimizing Zn deposition kinetics. Herein, the ZP of oxide nanoparticles (ONPs, i.e., MgO, SiO2, Al2O3) and the adsorption energy for Zn2+ are studied to evaluate their effects on enhancing the cyclic stability of AZIBs. A Gum Arabic (GA) coating strategy on the ONPs surface is executed to eliminate the interference of the surface chemical environment for Zn2+ adsorption energy. Therefore, the screening principle for ONPs based on ZP is established when they are used in colloidal electrolytes. Specifically, the SiO2 colloidal electrolyte (4Z&#8208;S) with the ZP of &#8722;28.6&#160;mV facilitates rapid Zn deposition kinetics. Accordingly, zinc electrodes in 4Z&#8208;S electrolyte realize a high coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.7% and long&#8208;term life of 3400&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. A 145 mAh Zn||I2 pouch cell achieves a high capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles, implying promising practical application.

         <title>Plants&#8208;Inspired Cellulose Nanocomposites&#8208;Based Soft Intelligent Actuators with Exceptional Thermal Conductivity and Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
CNFs&#8208;based composites with superior thermal conductivity and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness are successfully prepared, featuring &#8220;mimosa&#8221;&#8208;like ordered layered architectures. Integration with liquid crystal elastomers, CNFs&#8208;based composites are constructed as smart curtains and intelligent grabbers with biomimetic actuation. Furthermore, the CNFs&#8208;based composites used as sensors based on triboelectric effect to transmit messages through Morse code, demonstrating immense potential in flexible electronic devices for soft robotics and human&#8208;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Soft actuators with controllable responsiveness have wide application prospects in human&#8208;machine interfaces and intelligent robotics. However, the increasing integration and multi&#8208;functionality inevitably accumulate heat and radiate electromagnetic waves in electron components, detrimental to device service life and human health. Herein, cellulose nanofibers (CNFs)&#8208;based composites with excellent thermal conductivity (TC) and superior electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency (EMI SE) are prepared by layered dispersion of polyamide epichlorohydrin modified graphene nanosheets (pGNPs) within silver nanoparticles deposited CNFs through electrostatic self&#8208;assembly via vacuum filtration. The subsequent hot&#8208;pressing forms densely interconnected pGNPs within the CNFs&#8208;based composites with &#8220;mimosa&#8221;&#8208;like ordered layered architectures, showing a TC of 150.6&#160;W/(m&#160;K) and an EMI SE of 75&#160;dB. By integrating the CNFs&#8208;based composites with outstanding Joule heating performance into liquid crystal elastomers, smart curtains and intelligent grabbers are yield with a bending angle of 82&#176; under a voltage of 3&#160;V. Furthermore, the CNFs&#8208;based composite with an excellent conductivity (9.8 &#215; 103&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) is used as an electrode to construct triboelectric nanogenerators for transmitting information through Morse code. Overall, the as&#8208;prepared CNFs&#8208;based composites can be used to prolong the life of actuators and sensors, paving the way for multi&#8208;functional wearable terminals and biomimetic actuators.

         <title>Observation of Dislocation Non&#8208;Hermitian Skin Effect in a Torus&#8208;like Acoustic Metamaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waves in non&#8208;Hermitian systems can defy intuition by accumulating at specific locations rather than spreading uniformly. While conventional studies focused on boundaries, this work reports the first experimental observation of the dislocation non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect in acoustic metamaterials. Sound is shown to concentrate at one dislocation and vanish at another, unveiling a new non&#8208;Hermitian topological localization mechanism with potential for novel sound and energy control devices.








Abstract
The non&#8208;Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a striking phenomenon where a large number of states accumulate toward open boundaries, has garnered significant attention in both fundamental physics and emerging applications. Recent theoretical studies unveiled a distinctive dislocation NHSE by disentangling it from the established boundary NHSE, thereby bridging the gap between topological defects and non&#8208;Hermitian effects. In this work, the first experimental observation of the dislocation NHSE is reported, achieved using an ingeniously designed nonreciprocal, torus&#8208;like acoustic metamaterial with two dislocations of opposite Burgers vectors. The results show that the sound energy density inside the sample dramatically accumulates at one dislocation, while being unusually depleted at the other, a response distinct from all existing NHSE phenomena. This novel non&#8208;Hermitian effect not only probes the interplay between nontrivial defects and point&#8208;gap topology, but also holds promise for practical applications, such as the design of topological sound vacuum pumps.

         <title>Synergistic Catalysis of Pt&#8208;Based High&#8208;Entropy Clusters Coupled with Super&#8208;Hydrophilic CeO2 Enables Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel catalyst composed of Pt&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy clusters coupled with super&#8208;hydrophilic CeO2 is developed. This coupling simultaneously enhances the intrinsic activity and accelerates the interfacial H2O dissociation kinetics for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. When integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, the system achieves low cell voltages of 1.74 V at 1 A cm&#8722;2, and can maintain its performance for at least 500 h at an industrial&#8208;level current density.








Abstract
Simultaneously enhancing the intrinsic activity and accelerating H2O dissociation kinetics is crucial for developing advanced low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a low&#8208;noble&#8208;metal Pt&#8208;based high&#8208;entropy alloy clusters coupled with super&#8208;hydrophilic CeO2 on porous carbon support (Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;cluster/CeO2/C) is developed. The optimized Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;cluster/CeO2/C catalyst exhibits the faster Volmer&#8208;Tafel mechanism with an exceptionally low overpotential of 12.3 mV at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 m KOH, surpassing the benchmark commercial Pt/C (32.2 mV). When integrated into an anion exchange membrane water electrolysis, the system achieves low cell voltages of 1.74 V at 1 A cm&#8722;2, and can maintain its performance for at least 500 h at an industrial&#8208;level current density. Operando spectroscopy and density functional theory&#160;calculations reveal that H2O preferentially adsorbs on Ce site of CeO2, while the interfacial Pt sites in contact with Ce can simultaneously act as efficient active sites for H2O dissociation, thus significantly enhancing the sluggish Volmer kinetics via Ce&#8208;Pt dual&#8208;site synergy. Concurrently, the electronic structure of surface Pt sites is synergistically regulated through the metal bonds in the HEA and interfacial Pt&#9472;O&#9472;Ce linkage, thus effectively optimizing its hydrogen adsorption free energy. This work establishes a new paradigm in synergistic catalysis between Pt&#8208;HEA&#8208;clusters and CeO2 for efficient alkaline HER.

         <title>Multifunctional Buried Molecule&#8208;Bridge for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 4&#8208;Bromobenzylphosphnic acid molecule is constructed as a molecular bridge connecting Me&#8208;4PACz/perovskite to improve their interfacial characteristics achieving certified efficiency of 26.12% and improved stability for the resultant solar cells.








Abstract
Carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as an effective hole transportation layer have tremendously advanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the inhomogeneous distribution of SAMs on substrate and non&#8208;intimate interface contact can bring about significant interfacial energy loss at SAM/perovskite heterojunction. Herein, a small molecule 4&#8208;Bromobenzylphosphnic acid (4Br&#8208;BPA) is constructed as a molecule bridge connecting [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl] phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz) and perovskite, exhibiting multifunctionality on improving the interfacial characteristics. First, the small&#8208;size 4Br&#8208;BPA molecules can partly fill some voids on NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz anchored with NiOx via phosphonic acid group, meanwhile ameliorating the NiOx surface state. Second, the 4Br&#8208;BPA post&#8208;deposited onto Me&#8208;4PACz interacting with Me&#8208;4PACz via &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking has suppressed charge accumulation at interface, aligned the energy level of NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz consequently promoting the hole transportation. Third, the interplay between 4Br&#8208;BPA and perovskite enables effective passivation of interfacial traps, and the substrate NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz/4Br&#8208;BPA with improved wettability has facilitated the perovskite film growth with enhanced crystallization and released residual stress. Consequently, all these benefits have been transformed to an impressive PCE of 26.59% (certified 26.12%). The device based on 4Br&#8208;BPA also demonstrates much improved operational stability, maintaining &#8776;90% of initial efficiency under 1400 h continuous one&#8208;sun illumination.

         <title>Temporal Immunomodulatory Hydrogel Regulating the Immune&#8208;Osteogenic Cascade for Infected Bone Defects Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel with sequential ions&#8208;releases capability is constructed to regulate the immune&#8208;osteogenic cascade for infected bone defects regeneration. It guided macrophage polarization from M0 to M1 and subsequently to M2 phenotypes according to the healing progression. By simultaneously modulating the immune microenvironment, suppressing bacterial infection, promoting angiogenesis and osteogenesis, the temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel restored infected bone defects effectively.








Abstract
Early pathogen clearance and immunomodulation are critical for the restoration of infected bone defects. Conventional osteoimmunomodulatory strategies mainly emphasize M2 macrophage&#8208;mediated bone regeneration, neglecting the pivotal role of early&#8208;stage M1 macrophage&#8208;activated immune response in microbial elimination. This oversight ultimately compromises repair efficacy in infected bone defects. Herein, a temporal immunomodulatory hydrogel is developed to regulate the immune&#8208;osteogenic microenvironment for the repair of infected bone defects. The hydrogel is rapidly formed by crosslinking of acrylate&#8208;modified engineered protein with oxidized sodium alginate, mimicking extracellular matrix architecture to promote cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. To achieve temporal ion release, zinc&#8208;based nanoparticles mineralized with hydroxyapatite are incorporated within the hydrogel matrix. The early&#8208;stage release of Ca2+ promotes M1 polarization to inhibit infection, while sustained release of Zn2+ induces M2 polarization to promote osteogenic differentiation. This system further exhibits antioxidant and antibacterial properties, ensuring comprehensive immunomodulation across the bone healing process. In a rat model of infected cranial defects, the hydrogel effectively remodels the osteoimmune microenvironment, suppresses infection, and facilitates vascularized bone regeneration. This work highlights a temporal immunomodulatory strategy for infected bone repair and offers new insights into the design of advanced osteoimmunomodulatory biomaterials.

         <title>The Bionic Interface: Considering the Material Mediated Electrical Stimulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical stimulation directs stem cell fate in tissue engineering. Cellular responses are influenced by membrane properties, intrinsic cell state, material charge&#8208;transport characteristics, and the applied electrical signal. Additionally, a material&#8217;s ability to inject, store, and redistribute charge further modulates these responses. Understanding these mechanisms enables the rational design of highly effective electroactive scaffolds for precise stem cell control.








Abstract
Electromaterials, in the field of tissue engineering, are designed to use an electrical signal to induce specific biological responses in cells and tissues. Using materials to control stem cell fate is a substantial field of research within tissue engineering, where stem cell differentiation is controlled through careful design of the material properties (roughness, topography, stiffness, and surface chemistry); the introduction of electromaterials into this field has added an extra dimensionality along with the ability to provide dynamic, temporally controlled cues through electrical stimulation. While significant research has focused on the cell&#8208;material interface for electrical stimulation platforms, the underlying reasons why certain materials outperform others remain poorly understood. Most existing studies emphasise mechanical stiffness and chemical composition, often overlooking the role of electronic charge transport. In this perspective, the focus is shifted to the charge transport properties of commonly used electrically conductive materials&#8212;such as metal&#8208;based electrode, carbon&#8208;based composites, and conjugated polymers&#8212;and discusses how these mechanisms modulate cellular responses. It is proposed that a deeper understanding of how materials inject, store, and redistribute charge at the interface can offer a new paradigm in designing electrically active scaffolds for more predictable and effective stem cell modulation.

         <title>Revealing the Design Principle for Highly Compositional Reversible Transition Metal Chalcogenide Electrodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 2, 8 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides a fundamental understanding of the design principle for highly compositional reversible transition metal chalcogenide (TMC) electrodes in conversion&#8208;type batteries. That is, fabricating TMC/atomically dispersed catalyst (TMC/C&#8208;ADC) composites together with interfacial (e.g., stacking and orientation) engineering and multiscale (atomic, nano&#8208;, and macro&#8208;) structural co&#8208;modifications to accelerate reaction kinetics in both the discharging and charging processes.








Abstract
Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) are considered a promising kind of anode material for next&#8208;generation alkali metal ion batteries (AMIBs) due to their multielectron&#8208;transfer energy storage mechanism and low cost. However, their sluggish reaction kinetics lead to irreversible conversion reaction during cycling, resulting in low compositional reversibility and rapid battery failure. To improve their electrochemical performance in AMIBs, many efforts involving structure, composition, and interface modifications have been devoted. However, there is still a lack of a systematic understanding of the reversible conversion reaction mechanism and design principle for highly compositional reversible TMC electrodes. This perspective discusses the reversible conversion mechanism and key challenges of TMCs through a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Three kinds of modification strategies, including multi&#8208;scale structure construction, fabrication of TMC&#8208;based composite, and interfacial engineering, along with their working mechanisms on promoting the reversible conversion reaction of TMCs, are comprehensively elucidated. Finally, the current general design principle for compositional reversible TMC electrodes in AMIBs is summarized, while future research opportunities are discussed. This perspective provides fundamental and instructive insights for rational design and synthesis of highly reversible electrodes in conversion&#8208;type batteries.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Driven Switchable Material for Optical and Electronic Information Security: Electromagnetic Shielding and Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel composites with Cu&#8208;doped carbon dots exhibit water&#8208;triggered functional switching. In the hydrated state, abundant water dipoles and interfacial polarization enable efficient electromagnetic wave absorption. Upon dehydration, reconstructed rigid networks suppress nonradiative decay and activate dual&#8208;center room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. This wet&#8208;dry switchable strategy transforms water content variation into a programmable trigger for multifunctional electromagnetic and optical applications.








ABSTRACT
A multifunctional hydrogel capable of both wet&#8208;state microwave absorption and dry&#8208;state phosphorescence is designed. Incorporating Cu&#8208;doped carbon dots (Cux&#8208;CDs) into a polyacrylamide/carboxymethyl cellulose (PAM/CMC) network enables synergistic modulation of electromagnetic and optical behaviors. Cu doping effectively regulates the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and water state within the hydrogel, promoting charge migration and dipolar polarization, thereby significantly enhancing dielectric loss and absorption efficiency. The optimized hydrogel exhibits a minimum reflection loss of &#8722;62.67&#160;dB and an effective absorption bandwidth of 5.94&#160;GHz within the 2&#8211;18&#160;GHz range. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Cu&#8208;N coordination reduces the energy gap and enhances electronic delocalization, facilitating charge transfer. Upon dehydration, the polymer network reconstructs into a dense and rigid framework that suppresses nonradiative transitions, yielding stable blue and green room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence. Such a transition from wet&#8208;state absorption to dry&#8208;state emission, driven by Cu doping and hydrogen&#8208;bond engineering, provides a new paradigm for constructing stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels. This work offers a versatile strategy for designing multifunctional materials with potential applications in electromagnetic protection, information encryption, and optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Simultaneous Enhancement of Electron and Hole Mobility in Para&#8208;Azaquinodimethane&#8208;Derived Polymer by Individually Applying Various Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating para&#8208;azaquinodimethane into the backbone of diketopyrrolopyrrole polymers enhances orbital coupling with various additives, including p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ionic species. This molecular design, additive strategy, and orbital interactions, enable concurrent improvement of both electron and hole mobilities when each additive is applied individually, providing a simple and versatile strategy to boost charge carrier transport in organic semiconductors.








ABSTRACT
Achieving simultaneous enhancement of electron and hole mobility in organic semiconductors (OSCs) using a single additive remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a unique additive strategy that enables concurrent improvement of both n&#8208; and p&#8208;type transport in an n&#8208;dominant ambipolar polymer incorporating para&#8208;azaquinodimethane and diketopyrrolopyrrole. By individually applying various additives including ionic, p&#8208;type, and n&#8208;type compounds, we achieve unprecedented enhancements of both electron (&#8764;400%) and hole (&#8764;100%) mobility. Such parallel improvement is unattainable via conventional electron transfer mechanism. We ascribe this effect to optimized film morphology, reduced activation energy, and lowered contact resistance. To further elucidate additive&#8208;induced variations in electronic structure and guide future molecular design, density functional theory calculations reveal that incorporating para&#8208;azaquinodimethane into the polymer backbone facilitates strong orbital coupling with additives. This coupling introduces additional charge transport pathways between polymer segments, enhancing both electron and hole transport along lamellar and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking directions. Our findings suggest promoting robust orbital coupling between host polymers and additives offers a promising strategy to concurrently boost electron and hole mobility in a single OSC, effectively circumventing traditional limitations associated with separate p&#8208; and n&#8208;type additives/dopants.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Regulated Phase Switchable Peptide Droplets with Degradation Resistance for Intravenous Delivery of Biopharmaceuticals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide YHssHY is first self&#8208;assembled into liquid&#8208;like membraneless coacervates under acidic conditions, which are further tranformed to solid&#8208;like semipermeable coacervate vesicles upon oxidation with horseradish peroxidase. Under reductive microenvironment, the coacervate vesicles can return to liquid&#8208;like coacervates. Such a cyclic transition of coacervate vesicles could pave a new way for delivery of biophamaceuticals.








ABSTRACT
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) plays a ubiquitous and vital role during the formation of biomolecular coacervates, and the switchable phase transition between liquid and solid of these coacervates is crucial for a series of dynamic biochemical functions. Currently, tremendous work has been focused on constructing artificial coacervates using synthetic biomolecules; however, such a phase switch has not been achieved. Here, we demonstrate that by designing peptide sequences to match specific in vivo microenvironments, it is practical to utilize redox reactions to control the phase switch of peptide coacervates. Upon optimizing the chemical structure and concentration of peptide, as well as pH and temperature, both phase&#8208;separation and phase&#8208;transition dynamics could be finely regulated. Cyclically, liquid&#8208;like membraneless&#160;coacervates are oxidized into solid&#8208;like semipermeable coacervate vesicles, and return to liquid&#8208;like membraneless coacervates under reductive microenvironments. Furthermore, animal experiments confirmed that oxidized solid&#8208;like coacervate vesicles are able to remain stable against degradation during intravenous administration. Upon arriving at the reductive tumor site, solid&#8208;like coacervate&#160;vesicles gradually become liquid&#8208;like coacervate to promote intracellular siRNA delivery with significant inhibition effects against pancreatic tumor, which could pave the way for a new front of manipulating biomolecular LLPS for delivery of biopharmaceuticals.

         <title>Materials Informatics: Emergence to Autonomous Discovery in the Age of AI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We present AI&#8208;powered materials informatics not just as tools, but as evolving research ecosystems reshaping scientific discovery. We trace the historical context, current situation, and future development of the field, discussing common pitfalls, issues, and solutions as applied to specific materials. Given the costs of pre&#8208;trained models, we consider the merits of specialist large language models versus today's state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art generalists.








ABSTRACT
We provide a perspective on the evolution of materials informatics, tracing its conceptual roots to foundational ideas in physics and information theory and its maturation through the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Early contributions from Chelikowsky, Phillips, and Bhadeshia laid the groundwork for what has become a transformative approach to materials discovery. The U.S. Materials Genome Initiative catalyzed a surge in activity, and the period from 2014&#8211;2016 marked the first impactful applications of machine learning to materials problems. Since then, the field has seen rapid advances, particularly with the advent of deep learning and transformer&#8208;based large language models (LLMs), which now underpin tools for property prediction, synthesis planning, and inverse design. We present the subject not as a collection of tools, but as an evolving research ecosystem &#8211; tracing the historical context, current situation, and future development direction of the field. We review key methodologies&#8212;including approaches for sequential design, such as Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning, and transformers &#8212;highlighting their role in accelerating discovery and automating experimentation with growing efforts in building autonomous self&#8208;driving laboratories. We discuss common pitfalls, issues, and solutions associated with LLMs and Bayesian Optimization as applied to the study of specific materials systems.

     alt="Materials Informatics: Emergence to Autonomous Discovery in the Age of AI"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We present AI-powered materials informatics not just as tools, but as evolving research ecosystems reshaping scientific discovery. We trace the historical context, current situation, and future development of the field, discussing common pitfalls, issues, and solutions as applied to specific materials. Given the costs of pre-trained models, we consider the merits of specialist large language models versus today's state-of-the-art generalists.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide a perspective on the evolution of materials informatics, tracing its conceptual roots to foundational ideas in physics and information theory and its maturation through the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Early contributions from Chelikowsky, Phillips, and Bhadeshia laid the groundwork for what has become a transformative approach to materials discovery. The U.S. Materials Genome Initiative catalyzed a surge in activity, and the period from 2014&#8211;2016 marked the first impactful applications of machine learning to materials problems. Since then, the field has seen rapid advances, particularly with the advent of deep learning and transformer-based large language models (LLMs), which now underpin tools for property prediction, synthesis planning, and inverse design. We present the subject not as a collection of tools, but as an evolving research ecosystem &#8211; tracing the historical context, current situation, and future development direction of the field. We review key methodologies&#8212;including approaches for sequential design, such as Bayesian Optimization and Reinforcement Learning, and transformers &#8212;highlighting their role in accelerating discovery and automating experimentation with growing efforts in building autonomous self-driving laboratories. We discuss common pitfalls, issues, and solutions associated with LLMs and Bayesian Optimization as applied to the study of specific materials systems. Given the costs of pre-trained AI models for specific materials, we consider the merits of specialist LLMs versus today's state-of-the-art generalists. Finally, we assess emerging challenges and the potential for AI to evolve from a predictive tool into a collaborative partner in research. We argue that with advances in active learning, uncertainty quantification, and retrieval-augmented generation, a new era of autonomous materials science is within reach&#8212;one in which the human is increasingly taken out of the loop.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical&#8208;Heterogeneous Biogel Electrolytes Regulate Zinc Anode Interfacial Compatibility Towards Green and High&#8208;Performance Solid&#8208;State Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of biogel electrolytes with a hierarchical&#8208;heterogeneous structure is developed. Benefitting from the improved interfacial contact and enhanced toughness by heating treatment, this biogel electrolyte facilitates a Zn2+ 3D diffusion and suppresses dendrite Zn growth to regulate Zn anode interfacial compatibility, thereby achieving leading performance in hybrid capacitors and excellent outdoor applications.








ABSTRACT
Gel electrolytes are high&#8208;priority materials for solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors, characterized by high ionic conductivity and intrinsic mechanical flexibility. However, because the existing gel electrolytes are relatively soft and do not contact intimately with rigid Zn anodes, they have inferior interfacial compatibility with Zn anodes, leading to device degradation. Here we develop a class of biogel electrolytes by in situ crystallizing gelatin triple helix units from the alginate polymer domain to form a unique hierarchical&#8208;heterogeneous structure. The biogel electrolyte demonstrates combined advantages of high toughness, temperature&#8208;triggered adhesion, high Zn2+ transference number and temperature&#8208;independent ionic conductivity. These notable features favor Zn2+ 3D diffusion and accommodate zinc anode volume changes, thus enabling the symmetric Zn||Zn cell to highlight a balance among high current density, high areal capacity and prolonged cycling life. Moreover, the assembled zinc||activated carbon hybrid capacitor performs exceptional capacitive behavior and stable operation across the temperature range from 25&#176;C to &#8211;40&#176;C, delivering competitive energy density of 125.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 with high capacity retention of 97.1% over 10&#160;000 cycles even at &#8722;40&#176;C. Finally, system&#8208;level demonstration based on the resulting hybrid capacitors can power portable electronics in a power cable&#8208;free manner, validating applicability for green power sources in outdoor activities.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Synthesis of H2O2 via Spatial Separation Design and Anthraquinone Redox Shuttle in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionality&#8208;coupled spatial separation strategy is developed in an anthraquinone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (BTT&#8208;AQ). Its benzotrithiophene unit reduces oxygen, while the anthraquinone moiety promotes water oxidation via a hydrogen&#8208;bond network and facilitates proton transport through a redox shuttle mechanism. This cooperative design optimizes mass transfer and charge separation, resulting in efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production.








ABSTRACT
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as attractive platforms for solar&#8209;driven H2O2 production directly from pure water. However, conventional integrated active&#8209;site architectures that couple oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) often suffer from inefficient photogenerated charge separation and severe recombination. Here, we propose a functionality&#8208;coupled spatial separation strategy that integrates site&#8209;isolated redox domains with an anthraquinone (AQ) redox&#8209;shuttle characteristics, exemplified by an AQ&#8209;functionalized COF (BTT&#8209;AQ). Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the benzotrithiophene (BTT) domain acts as a selective two&#8209;electron ORR site, while the AQ domain promotes four&#8209;electron WOR via a hydrogen&#8209;bonded carbonyl&#8208;water network, thereby suppressing charge recombination. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy confirms reversible hydrogenation of AQ to H2AQ, which is subsequently oxidized by O2 to yield H2O2, establishing a thermodynamically favorable short&#8209;range proton&#8209;transfer pathway for ORR. Without sacrificial agents, BTT&#8209;AQ achieves a remarkable H2O2 production rate of 4218 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, outperforming redox&#8208;inert analogues BTT&#8209;FO (1368 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and BTT&#8209;AD (532 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). This study demonstrates a generalizable design principle that couples spatial charge separation with molecular redox&#8209;shuttle characteristics, paving the way for highly efficient solar H2O2 production.

         <title>Unleashing the Electromechanical Response of Ferroelastic Domain Reorganization in Mixed&#8208;Phase Tetragonal Ferroelectric Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electromechanical responses of thin films are, in general, limited by substrate clamping and electrical breakdown. Multilayer heterostructures based on the mixed&#8208;phase state of the canonical tetragonal ferroelectric PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 address such challenges and exhibit enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33eff and maximum electromechanical response Smax, demonstrating the prospects of rivaling or even surpassing the comprehensive performance of bulk piezoceramics in sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm films.








ABSTRACT
There is considerable interest in thin&#8208;film electromechanical materials due to the prospect for device miniaturization for an array of applications. The electromechanical response of thin films, however, is generally limited by substrate clamping and electrical breakdown. This work designs thin&#8208;film piezoceramics with sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm thickness that address the limitations of clamping and breakdown strength and, as a result, produces films that rival or surpass their bulk piezoceramics counterparts in terms of performance. In the tetragonal ferroelectric PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3, strain&#8208;induced mixtures of in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane oriented domain structures are leveraged to achieve the ferroelastic interconversion of in&#8208;plane&#8208;polarized a domains to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8208;polarized c domains, opening a pathway to enhanced electromechanical response (1.25%, d33eff${\bm{d}}_{33}^{{\bm{eff}}}$= 170 pm/V). Operando second harmonic generation and scanning transmission electron microscopy studies confirm the a&#8208;to&#8208;c ferroelastic conversion, and establish the switching from a1/a2 to c/a superdomains as the underlying mechanism for the large response. In turn, PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3/0.68PbMg1/3Nb2/3O3&#8208;0.32PbTiO3/PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 trilayers are fabricated to improve the electrical&#8208;breakdown strength while maintaining the domain&#8208;structure interconversion, resulting in the enhancement of the electromechanical strain to 2.1%. Overall, by combining domain&#8208;structure optimization and multilayer&#8208;heterostructure design, remarkable electromechanical response can be achieved even in sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm thin films normally subject to clamping effects.

         <title>Robust Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Mechanoluminescence in Flexible Elastomers Without Pre&#8208;Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust, self&#8208;powered, and self&#8208;recovered Sr3(PO4)2:Pr3+/PDMS flexible elastomer has been developed, exhibiting strong solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet mechanoluminescence under various mechanical stimuli and demonstrating great promise for advanced monitoring, sensing, and tagging applications under all&#8208;weather conditions.








ABSTRACT
Flexible mechanoluminescence (ML) composite elastomers have emerged as promising materials for wearable devices, sensing, and monitoring applications. However, most reported systems emit predominantly in the visible or near&#8208;infrared region, which can only be effectively detected in darkness. Solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (UV) ML systems that can be monitored under all&#8208;weather conditions, in contrast, remain scarce and typically rely on pre&#8208;irradiated phosphors. Herein, a robust solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet&#8208;C (UVC) ML composite elastomer composed of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Sr3(PO4)2:Pr3+ (SPO:Pr) phosphors is developed. This composite elastomer exhibits self&#8208;powered and self&#8208;recovered UVC emission centered at 264&#160;nm in response to various mechanical stimuli, such as stretching, rubbing, and impacting. Notably, it demonstrates remarkable repeatability and cyclic stability, maintaining detectable UVC emission over 10,000 continuous stretching cycles (the UVC power intensity during the first cycle can reach 12.1 mW&#183;m&#8722;2), accompanied by rapid self&#8208;recovery behavior. Comprehensive experimental analyses reveal that interfacial triboelectrification, originating from electron transfer from the SPO:Pr phosphors to the PDMS matrix, dominates the underlying UVC ML mechanism. This new series of pre&#8208;irradiation&#8208;free and self&#8208;recoverable UVC ML elastomers holds great potential for practical applications under all&#8208;weather conditions, such as structural failure monitoring, covert optical tagging and tracking, and collision detection.

         <title>Coffee&#8208;Ring&#8208;Engineered Interfacial Layer Enables Fluid&#8208;Locking for Scalable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the coffee&#8208;ring effect, we introduce a flow&#8208;locking network that regulates perovskite colloidal particles dynamics to preserve crystal uniformity during large&#8208;area printed. This design suppresses long&#8208;range disorder about colloidal particle migration, homogenizing solute distribution at the buried interface. Consequently, the resulting PSCs achieve a stabilized PCE of 26.61% and 21.39% (0.1 and 100 cm2), with minimal efficiency loss across scales, underscoring the potential of interfacial flow&#8208;regulated for scalable perovskite photovoltaics.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology, offering outstanding power conversion efficiency and significant potential for large&#8208;scale deployment. However, during printed fabrication, the intrinsic coffee&#8208;ring effect induces heterogeneous deposition of colloidal particles, leading to non&#8208;uniform crystallization that critically limits the performance of large&#8208;area devices. This issue not only complicates the crystallization dynamics of perovskite films but also impedes the development of a universal fluidic control strategy applicable across device scales. In this work, we harnessed the mechanisms of coffee&#8208;ring formation and employed rapid drying combined with droplet fragmentation to construct a size&#8208;tunable flow&#8208;locking network at the buried interface. This network effectively confines the disordered migration of perovskite colloidal particles throughout the flowing and drying stages, suppressing the formation of macroscopic coffee rings and mitigating their detrimental impact on device crystallization and performance. As a result, the optimized PSCs deliver a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.61%, while a large&#8208;area module (100 cm2) maintains an impressive PCE of 21.39%, demonstrating excellent scalability and device uniformity.

         <title>Large Capacitive Energy Storage in Linear&#8208;Like MLCCs with Tailored Atomic&#8208;Scale Polymorphic Polarization Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Driven by miniaturization and integration demands, next&#8208;generation electronics impose increasingly stringent performance requirements on dielectric energy storage devices. Entropy engineering&#8208;induced atomic&#8208;scale polymorphic polarization fluctuations in BNT&#8208;based MLCCs enable an ultrahigh recoverable energy density of 21.3 J&#183;cm&#8722;3, a high energy efficiency of 94.5%, and remarkable stability, providing an innovative route for the design of high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors.








ABSTRACT
The development of portable electronic devices and new energy fields has placed higher demands on the energy storage properties of lead&#8208;free multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). Here, we propose a strategy for inducing atomic&#8208;scale polymorphic polarization fluctuations via entropy engineering. This strategy promotes atomic&#8208;scale lattice disorder through increasing entropy, induces the formation of atomic&#8208;scale polymorphic polarization fluctuations with coexisting rhombohedral and tetragonal phase, significantly weakens polar anisotropy and domain switching barriers, and thus realizes a linear&#8208;like polarization behavior with low hysteresis. A giant recoverable energy density (Wrec) of 21.3 J&#183;cm&#8722;3 under a high electric field of 1045 kV&#183;cm&#8722;1 is obtained in the high&#8208;entropy MLCC, accompanied by a high energy efficiency (&#951;) of 94.5%. Benefiting from such structural advantage, the MLCC prototype devices also possess excellent broad&#8208;temperature, frequency, and cyclic stability. This work presents a reliable technical approach for the design of superior&#8208;performing MLCCs by revealing the entropy&#8208;structure&#8208;performance correlation.

         <title>Tunable Enhancement of T Cell Expansion Through Modulation of Stiffness and Adhesion Receptor Engagement in an Engineered Hydrogel Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We develop a hydrogel scaffold with controlled substrate stiffness and ligand functionalization for cell culture. Stiff substrates presenting CD3/CD28/CD2 ligands induce 2000&#8208;fold expansion of T cells; this is 68% greater than the clinical standard (Dynabeads) and the first hydrogel capable of large&#8208;scale expansion. Although expanding at a lower yield, soft substrates produced T cells with superior antigen&#8208;specific killing selectivity. We summarize considerations for expansion mechanics, ligands, and cell phenotype.








ABSTRACT
Adoptive T cell therapies (ACT) are an important class of oncology treatments that require ex vivo T cell expansion for clinical success. Technologies that can control both phenotype and yield in expanded cell products are highly desired. Here, we develop a new hydrogel scaffold for controlled T cell expansion with yields of up to 2000&#215; fold in two weeks, compared to other hydrogel constructs (&#8776;250&#215;) and Dynabeads (&#8776;1200&#215;). Our 2D polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) hydrogel scaffold is cross&#8208;linked with streptavidin moieties to present various biotinylated ligands to cells with controlled hydrogel stiffness (PEGDA&#8208;Strep). Using this platform, we demonstrate that combining substrate stiffness with adhesion receptor ligands (aLFA&#8208;1 or aCD2) dictates T cell activation and proliferation. On stiff substrates, these ligands drove expansions 49% (aLFA&#8208;1) and 68% (aCD2) greater than Dynabeads with comparable T cell products, preceded by elevated metabolic and transcriptional activity. Notably, while stiff substrates increased yield, soft substrates produced T cells with superior antigen&#8208;specific killing selectivity. These findings highlight the role of mechanical sensing in T cell&#8208;APC interactions and suggest improved manufacturing methods for adoptive T cell therapy (ACT).

         <title>Coral&#8208;Inspired Double Cellulose Crosslinked Aerogel Triboelectric Sensors with Wide Pressure Monitoring Range for Multi&#8208;Scenario Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by coral, this Janus cellulose aerogel sensor features a double cellulose&#8208;crosslinked network. It exhibits exceptional mechanical strength (437.5% enhancement in Young's modulus), a record&#8208;wide pressure range (0&#8211;800 kPa) reported to date for cellulose&#8208;based triboelectric sensors, and proven biocompatibility, enabling high&#8208;performance applications in human posture sensing and human motion monitoring.








ABSTRACT
Current development in cellulose&#8208;based sensors remain restricted by limited mechanical strength and insufficient sensitivity range. Inspired by coral structure, we report a Janus cellulose aerogel (JCA) based triboelectric sensor (JCAS) featuring a unique double cellulose crosslinked network. The biomimetic structure enhances intermolecular interactions and optimizes the molecular chain structure, significantly improving mechanical stability and operational durability. Consequently, the JCA demonstrates a remarkable 437.5% increase in Young's modulus compared to pristine cellulose aerogel (PCA), enabling it to withstand loads over 50&#160;000 times its own weight. The corresponding JCAS exhibits high performance, including stable operation under high&#8208;pressure (300&#160;kPa for 4 h), an extended cycling longevity, and a reliable sensing range of 0&#8211;800&#160;kPa which is the widest reported to date for cellulose&#8208;based triboelectric sensors to our knowledge. Biocompatibility tests further confirm their suitability for wearable applications. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of JCASs by integrating them into wearable devices for human posture recognition. This work provides a novel strategy for synthesizing crosslinked cellulose aerogels, promoting the practical applications of cellulose&#8208;based triboelectric sensors.

         <title>Ferroelectric Reconfigurable Homojunction Miniaturized Computational Spectrometers for Dynamic Spectral Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized computational spectral sensing platform based on a ferroelectrically reconfigurable WSe2 homojunction is designed for high&#8208;resolution spectral reconstruction and dynamic spectral sensing. This platform supports dual operational modalities: a preprogrammed static mode and a dynamically tunable mode. This system shows broad spectral sensitivity and capability to detect dynamic spectral variations, offering potential for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time spectral sensing.








Abstract
Miniaturized spectrometers are crucial for advancing compact, energy&#8208;efficient, and real&#8208;time spectral sensing systems. However, traditional spectrometer architectures are limited by mechanical components and efficiency, making it difficult to consistently shrink their size. Here, we report a miniaturized computational spectral sensing platform based on a ferroelectrically reconfigurable WSe2 homojunction, achieving both high&#8208;resolution spectral reconstruction and dynamic spectral sensing. The device operates under a non&#8208;volatile, near&#8208;zero&#8208;power standby mode enabled by the retention property of ferroelectric polarization, ensuring energy&#8208;efficient monitoring without a continuous power supply. Event&#8208;driven triggers combined with computational reconstruction enable real&#8208;time spectral tracking with &#8764;32 &#181;s response latency. This system shows broad spectral sensitivity (450 nm&#8211;950&#160;nm) and the capability to detect dynamic spectral variations, validated via monitoring reflectance spectra of VO2 film during phase transitions. This work reveals great potential for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time spectral sensing, paving the way for on&#8208;site spectral analysis.

         <title>Linker Group Directed High Mass Activity Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Cathode in Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;functionalized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst achieves record mass activity in proton exchange membrane fuel cell. C&#9552;O moieties act as linker groups to anchor Fe precursors and regulate ionomer assembly, thereby boosting active site density and optimizing carbon/ionomer interfaces. Gram&#8208;scale synthesis and 500 W stack demonstration highlight its scalability and economic advantage for next&#8208;generation fuel cell applications.








ABSTRACT
Atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts are regarded as promising alternatives to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (PGM) catalysts for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, their further development is hindered by inadequate utilization of active sites in membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Herein, we developed a high mass activity O&#8211;FeNC catalyst with high site density and enhanced site utilization. C&#9552;O groups function as hard base linkers, promoting the densification of FeN4 sites through Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. Moreover, they also direct interfacial alignment within triple&#8208;phase boundaries, leading to concentrated hydronium ions and accelerated oxygen permeation via regulated ionomer nanophase segregation. As a result, the obtained O&#8211;FeNC cathode delivered a current density of 66.45 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.90 ViR&#8208;free, surpassing the US Department of Energy 2025 target (44 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.9 ViR&#8208;free), with a mass activity that is 59% higher than commercial Pt/C. The peak power densities reached 1.8 W cm&#8722;2 under H2&#8211;O2 and 0.93 W cm&#8722;2 under H2&#8211;air, alongside demonstrated industrial scalability through gram&#8208;scale synthesis and a 500 W PGM&#8208;free cathode stack prototype.

         <title>High&#8208;&#954; Perovskite&#8208;Like Ternary Niobium Oxide Dielectrics for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;&#954; dielectrics are vital for scaled electronics. Here, a family of 2D high&#8208;&#954; perovskite&#8208;like ternary niobium oxides is synthesized via a molten salt&#8208;assisted method. Their integration into FETs and logic gates reveals superior switching characteristics, providing a fresh material platform and new insights for the advancement of high&#8208;performance 2D electronics.








ABSTRACT
High&#8208;&#954; dielectrics with exceptional interface quality are essential for the field&#8208;effect control of nanoscale transistors. However, their design remains challenging due to competing atomic&#8208;scale polarization requirements. Here, we demonstrate nonlayered perovskite&#8208;like ternary niobium oxides (CaNb2O6, KNb3O8, and Na2Nb4O11) as promising candidates, where strong Nb 4d&#8208;O 2p covalent hybridization enables pronounced Nb5+ ionic displacements and enhanced polarization, while ionic bonding from intercalated Ca/K/Na suppresses electronic transitions, widening the bandgap and enhancing stability via configurational entropy. We successfully synthesize these high&#8208;quality nanoflakes through a scalable molten&#8208;salt method. Crucially, these oxides demonstrate a combination of high dielectric constants (&#8764;16, 9, and 68 for CaNb2O6, KNb3O8, and Na2Nb4O11, respectively), wide bandgaps (&#8764;4&#160;eV), large breakdown field strengths (&gt; 4.9 MV&#8201;cm&#8722;1), and excellent air stability. Furthermore, due to the low&#8208;contamination transfer via a fully dry process, MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with these gate dielectrics achieve low subthreshold swings (&#8764;60&#160;mV dec&#8722;1), ON/OFF ratios &gt;&#160;107, gate leakage currents below 10&#8722;6 A cm&#8722;2, and ultralow trap densities. We show high&#8208;performance NOT and NAND gates using a CaNb2O6 dielectric layer, with the inverter achieving a static power consumption of &lt; 0.02 &#181;W and a gain of &#8764;20. This work provides new opportunities for the development of next&#8208;generation 2D electronics devices.

         <title>Electrically Assisted Thermal Stamping of Tunable Carbon&#8208;Based Nanofilms for Direct Fabrication of Hydrophobic, Energy Harvesting, and Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the electrically assisted thermal stamping (EATS) method for direct fabrication of carbon&#8208;based nanofilms and their multifunctional applications. Localized Joule heating triggers simultaneous exfoliation, reduction, and fluoropolymer incorporation under ambient conditions, yielding tunable carbon&#8208;based thin&#8208;film coatings, including rGO, PTFE, and rGO/PTFE. This single&#8208;step, rapid, and lithography&#8208;free process enables direct integration into diverse thin&#8208;film devices, including hydrophobic surface engineering, energy harvesters, and sensors, highlighting the scalability and versatility of EATS for next&#8208;generation electronics and environmental interfaces.








ABSTRACT
The demand for multifunctional thin&#8208;film devices has accelerated the development of scalable fabrication techniques capable of precisely controlling composition, structure, and patterning. However, conventional approaches rely on complex, multi&#8208;step processing and harsh conditions, limiting their applicability. Herein, we report a single&#8208;step, electrically assisted thermal stamping (EATS) method for the direct and scalable fabrication of carbon&#8208;based nanofilms, including reduced graphene oxide (rGO), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and their nanocomposite films. By applying localized Joule heating to PTFE&#8208;embedded carbon paper under ambient conditions, EATS induces graphite exfoliation, GO reduction, and PTFE incorporation, thereby eliminating the need for multi&#8208;step processing or harsh environments. The resulting films exhibit tunable thickness, morphology, and composition, governed by EATS power density and duration. EATS enables spatially selective patterning without the need for complex lithographic techniques. The versatility of EATS is demonstrated through the direct fabrication of functional devices: (i) hydrophobic coatings with contact angles tunable from 44.3&#176; to 109.8&#176;, (ii) triboelectric nanogenerators achieving 10.11&#160;mW cm&#8722;3 power density with &lt;2.8% variation over 10&#160;000 cycles, and (iii) humidity sensors exhibiting a 3.56% sensing error across 50&#8211;100% relative humidity. These results establish EATS as a powerful, lithography&#8208;free fabrication platform for multifunctional thin&#8208;film devices, offering a generalizable strategy for next&#8208;generation electronics.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble PVA Macrothiol Enables Two&#8208;Photon Microfabrication of Cell&#8208;Interactive Hydrogel Structures at 400 mm s&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
A PVA&#8208;based macromolecular thiol&#8208;ene formulation enables efficient two&#8208;photon polymerization at extremely low polymer concentrations and high writing speeds of 400&#160;mm s&#8722;1 (20&#215;), allowing high&#8208;fidelity laser writing of cell&#8208;interactive hydrogel structures on demand.








ABSTRACT
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) has garnered increasing attention for engineering hydrogels with tailored architectures and controlled cellular responses. However, current 2PP strategies typically rely on (meth)acrylated proteins and inefficient chain&#8208;growth crosslinking mechanisms. Although thiol&#8208;ene photo&#8208;click reactions can enhance 2PP efficiency, commercial water&#8208;soluble thiol crosslinkers (e.g., DTT&#8212;dithiothreitol) tend to form intramolecular loops and introduce structural defects due to their short molecular length. As a result, high polymer concentrations (often up to 20%&#8211;50%) are required to achieve satisfactory print fidelity. Here, we develop a series of water&#8208;soluble, polyvinyl alcohol macromolecular thiol (PVASH, bearing 10&#8211;35 thiol groups) for fast high&#8208;fidelity hydrogel microfabrication via 2PP. A two&#8208;step synthesis yields PVASH with tunable degrees of substitution and excellent water&#8208;solubility. Compared to DTT and polyethylene glycol di&#8208;thiol, PVASH&#8208;based hydrogels exhibit reduced swelling, enhanced mechanical properties, and significantly improved printing fidelity. Notably, several complex hydrogel structures are fabricated at laser power as low as 20&#160;mW and high scanning speeds of up to 400&#160;mm s&#8722;1, achieving sub&#8208;micron feature size at 3% polymer concentration. After biofunctionalization with RGD motifs, the micro&#8208;scaffolds support cell infiltration, adhesion, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. Altogether, this work reports a new strategy for 2PP microfabrication of cell&#8208;interactive hydrogel structures with unprecedented printing efficiency and precision.

         <title>Exploring the Potential of Ni&#8208;Based Hydrogen Evolution Catalysts in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the critical role of Ni&#8208;based catalysts in advancing AEMWE for green hydrogen production is elucidated; the performance gap between Ni&#8208;based and noble metal catalysts under industrial conditions is analyzed; key challenges, including sluggish HER kinetics, bubble&#8208;induced losses, and catalyst instability, are evaluated; advanced regulation strategies, such as heteroatom doping, morphological engineering, and interface design, are proposed; and a comprehensive framework for transitioning Ni&#8208;based catalysts from laboratory research to industrial AEMWE applications is provided.








ABSTRACT
The pressing need for sustainable hydrogen production has spotlighted anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) as a promising technology, due to its potential for cost&#8208;effective and efficient hydrogen evolution. Nickel (Ni)&#8208;based catalysts have emerged as pivotal players in this domain, offering a compelling alternative to noble metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in AEMWE. Despite their widespread use, challenges such as insufficient activity, conductivity, and long&#8208;term stability under alkaline conditions hinder their commercial scalability. This review provides a systematic exploration of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for HER in AEMWE, beginning with an in&#8208;depth analysis of design principles, including reaction mechanisms, key performance descriptors, and their interrelationships. Subsequently, we categorize advanced regulation strategies for Ni&#8208;based HER catalysts into distinct approaches, offering a critical evaluation of catalyst design, synthesis methods, electrocatalytic performance, and representative examples alongside current limitations. The diverse types of Ni&#8208;based HER catalysts, including metals/alloys, oxides/hydroxides, and Ni&#8208;based composites, are examined, highlighting their respective advantages and drawbacks. We also review the latest research progress on Ni&#8208;based catalysts in practical AEMWE devices. Finally, this review concludes with a discussion of challenges and future prospects, aiming to guide the development of Ni&#8208;based HER catalysts for industrial&#8208;scale hydrogen production via AEMWE.

         <title>Hydrophobic Interaction&#8208;Directed Solvent&#8208;Free Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We propose a hydrophobic interaction&#8208;directed assembly strategy to fabricate robust MXene&#8208;chitosan aerogels via solvent&#8208;free ambient&#8208;pressure drying. Selective amine reduction minimizes capillary forces, boosting compressive strength by 4,477% while enabling tunable mechanics and hydrophobicity. The aerogels achieve switchable EMI shielding (76 dB) or absorption (6.4 GHz) and record&#8208;high fire resistance (60% LOI) with thermal insulation and early fire&#8208;warning. This scalable approach advances multifunctional aerogels for extreme environments.








ABSTRACT
Scalable solvent&#8208;free ambient&#8208;pressure drying (APD) of robust multifunctional MXene aerogels remains significantly challenging. We present a hydrophobic interaction&#8208;directed assembly strategy among MXene, chitosan (CS), and glutaraldehyde (GA) to engineer aerogels with programmable hydrophobicity&#8208;mechanics. Selective reduction of CS amine groups suppresses capillary forces upon solvent&#8208;free APD, yielding 4,477% compressive strength enhancement over conventional MXene aerogels. Composition tuning delivers switchable electromagnetic functionality: 25.6 wt.% CS generates a 76&#160;dB microwave shielding effectiveness, while 67.4 wt.% yields a 6.4&#160;GHz broadband microwave absorption, which is comparable to the best MXene aerogels. The APD MXene aerogels further exhibit exceptional thermal protection, characterized by a record&#8208;high limiting oxygen index of 60%, outstanding thermal insulation, reliable structural integrity at elevated temperatures, and a high&#8208;efficiency early fire&#8208;warning capability, outperforming previously reported nanostructured monoliths. This work offers a general, scalable, and solvent&#8208;free route for assembling MXene and other nonstructured aerogels with integrated mechanics and functionalities, advancing their application in aerospace and energy systems.

         <title>Suppressing Exciton&#8208;Polaron Annihilation in a D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Organic Semiconductor Toward Electrically Pumped Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spirofluorene&#8208;core D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A organic semiconductor that features both outstanding optical gain and balanced carrier mobilities is developed to suppress exciton&#8208;polaron annihilation, which is crucial for maintaining population inversion and achieving optically pumped lasing in the operating organic light&#8208;emitting diode. This advancement paves a promising path toward the realization of electrically pumped organic lasers.








ABSTRACT
Electrically pumped organic lasers hold tremendous potential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. However, their realization remains a grand challenge due to detrimental exciton&#8208;polaron annihilation, which is one of the most recognized yet unresolved exciton losses in organic semiconductors under electrical excitation. Unbalanced charge carrier mobilities have been identified as the primary cause of polaron&#8208;related annihilation processes. In this work, we address this issue by developing a spirofluorene&#8208;cored D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A compound that features both outstanding optical gain and balanced carrier mobilities. When integrated into an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) architecture, the newly developed material exhibits enhanced device performance and reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off, which can be ascribed to the inhibition of polaron accumulation, as evidenced by the time&#8208;resolved electroluminescent measurements. More importantly, electrically pumped transient absorption spectroscopy further confirms the suppression of polaron&#8208;induced nonradiative losses, which is crucial for maintaining population inversion and achieving optically pumped lasing in the operating OLED. These findings shed light on how chemical modifications can mitigate exciton&#8208;polaron annihilation in operating devices, opening a promising avenue toward the realization of electrically pumped organic lasers.

         <title>Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Methanol on Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts: Mechanistic Insights and Industrial Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a focused and integrated perspective on copper&#8208;based catalysts for the selective electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol. It elucidates active site dynamics, mechanistic pathways, and structure&#8211;activity relationships, while connecting fundamental insights with catalyst design, reactor engineering, and techno&#8208;economic considerations to guide the development of commercially viable, renewable&#8208;energy&#8208;driven methanol production technologies.








ABSTRACT
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) offers a promising route to convert CO2 into high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals using renewable energy. Among the diverse ECO2R products, the selective conversion of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) holds significant industrial importance as a fuel and chemical feedstock. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in Copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalysts for selective ECO2R to CH3OH. Key advancements in catalyst design and synthesis are discussed, followed by mechanistic insights obtained through computational modeling and advanced characterization techniques. Special focus is given to the structure&#8208;activity relationship that controls CH3OH selectivity, disclosing the importance of intermediate stabilization and electronic structure tuning. Further, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cu&#8208;based materials and benchmarking their performances under various operating conditions, including the role of electrolyzer configurations, electrolytes, and ion&#8208;exchange membranes, is summarized. Moreover, we analyze challenges in upscaling, such as stability, selectivity under high current densities, and integration with renewable energy sources.

     alt="Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction to Methanol on Copper-Based Catalysts: Mechanistic Insights and Industrial Prospects"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review presents a focused and integrated perspective on copper-based catalysts for the selective electrochemical reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanol. It elucidates active site dynamics, mechanistic pathways, and structure&#8211;activity relationships, while connecting fundamental insights with catalyst design, reactor engineering, and techno-economic considerations to guide the development of commercially viable, renewable-energy-driven methanol production technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction (ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) offers a promising route to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into high-value-added chemicals using renewable energy. Among the diverse ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R products, the selective conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH) holds significant industrial importance as a fuel and chemical feedstock. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in Copper (Cu)-based catalysts for selective ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH. Key advancements in catalyst design and synthesis are discussed, followed by mechanistic insights obtained through computational modeling and advanced characterization techniques. Special focus is given to the structure-activity relationship that controls CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH selectivity, disclosing the importance of intermediate stabilization and electronic structure tuning. Further, state-of-the-art Cu-based materials and benchmarking their performances under various operating conditions, including the role of electrolyzer configurations, electrolytes, and ion-exchange membranes, is summarized. Moreover, we analyze challenges in upscaling, such as stability, selectivity under high current densities, and integration with renewable energy sources. Besides, the potential of tandem and hybrid systems to improve reaction pathways is also emphasized. Finally, techno-economic considerations are explored to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH production. By combining fundamental understanding with practical implementation, this review provides strategic direction toward the rational design of Cu-based electrocatalysts and the development of commercially viable ECO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R systems for sustainable CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>van der Waals Lamination for Integrating Metal Halide in Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal halide perovskites are promising for optoelectronics, yet incompatible with conventional processing for device fabrication. This review highlights van der Waals (vdW) lamination as a damage&#8208;free and cost&#8208;effective alternative to address the challenges of integration, which facilitates high&#8208;performance and stable optoelectronics by assembling perovskites with materials of different dimensionality. Current challenges and potential prospects are also discussed.








ABSTRACT
Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as promising materials for optoelectronic applications owing to their exceptional optoelectronic properties such as high absorption coefficients, tunable bandgaps, and low&#8208;cost solution processability. However, integrating MHPs with other functional components for optoelectronic device fabrication remains challenging because of limited thermal stability and solvent sensitivity, resulting in their incompatibility with conventional processing techniques. To address these challenges, van der Waals (vdW) lamination has emerged as an alternative &#8220;damage&#8208;free&#8221; integration approach. This review compares vdW lamination with conventional integration methods, highlighting the fundamental principles and distinct advantages of the vdW lamination approach. In MHP&#8208;based optoelectronics, vdW lamination strategies are categorized according to component dimensionality: one&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (1D/3D) lamination using nanowires or carbon nanotubes; two&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (2D/3D) lamination using 2D semiconductors such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs); and three&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional (3D/3D) lamination involving metals, semiconductors, and insulators. High&#8208;performance and stable perovskite&#8208;based devices can be achieved by carefully selecting the materials and optimizing the van der Waals lamination conditions. Finally, we summarize the recent advances in vdW lamination&#8208;based integration for perovskite optoelectronics. Critical issues that hinder further development and practical implementation of vdW lamination in MHPs are identified, and potential strategies are discussed to stimulate future research within the field.

         <title>Nanoconfined Deposition Enables High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Mg Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By confining flux through a nanosheet network constructed on the magnesium metal surface, uniform deposition of magnesium ions is achieved. The symmetric cells cycle stably for 1000 h at 3 mA cm&#8722;2, while the full cells cycle stably for 3000 cycles. The Mg&#8208;Cu2&#8208;xSe pouch cell achieves an energy density of 143.74 Wh/kg.








ABSTRACT
Dendritic growth resulting from inhomogeneous magnesium plating and stripping compromises anode integrity, critically limiting the achievable energy density of magnesium metal batteries. Addressing this challenge requires controlling the spatial uniformity of nucleation site distribution, magnesium ion flux, and interfaces. Herein, a scalable surface architecture is engineered on magnesium foil, forming a conformal nanosheet network that minimizes spatial inconsistencies to ensure uniform nucleation and deposition of magnesium metal. The confinement index is introduced to quantitatively describe the network's stability to regulate magnesium ion deposition. The optimized magnesium anode exhibited exceptional stability, achieving over 500&#160;h of reversible plating/stripping under harsh conditions. After 5 days of air exposure, the optimized magnesium anode maintains cycling performance with no degradation, highlighting its outstanding resistance to atmospheric oxidation. Paired with a high mass loading of 17.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 Mo6S8, full cells demonstrate remarkable cycling stability throughout 3000 cycles. Moreover, large&#8208;sized pouch cells incorporating optimized magnesium anodes demonstrate stable cycling performance over 600 cycles when paired with a high mass loading Mo6S8 cathode, while achieving a high energy density of 143.74&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in combination with a Cu2&#8722;xSe cathode. These results substantiate the practical applicability and technological promise of an optimized magnesium anode in advanced battery systems.

         <title>Materials and System Design for Self&#8208;Decision Bioelectronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights how self&#8208;decision bioelectronic systems integrate sensing, computation, and therapy into autonomous, closed&#8208;loop platforms that continuously monitor and treat diseases, marking a major step toward intelligent, self&#8208;regulating healthcare technologies.








ABSTRACT
Self&#8208;decision bioelectronic systems mark a transformative leap from conventional &#8216;sense&#8208;then&#8208;treat&#8217; paradigms toward autonomous, closed&#8208;loop therapeutics, with material innovation serving as the pivotal enabler. This review posits that material innovation is the pivotal enabler of this transition, seamlessly integrating high&#8208;performance sensing, intelligent computation, and adaptive intervention. We elucidate how recent advances in electrochemical, electrophysiological, optical, and mechanical sensors fabricated from soft conductors, responsive polymers, and nanocomposites yield critical data streams for reliable physiological monitoring. We further explore how decision&#8208;making architectures, ranging from threshold&#8208;based logic to neuromorphic computation, transform these data into real&#8208;time therapeutic commands. Diverse material platforms are positioned as the central drivers of functional outputs, enabling precise electrical stimulation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery, mechanical actuation, and optical modulation, as demonstrated in artificial pancreas systems, neurointerventions, and smart wound dressings. Finally, we discuss system&#8208;level integration strategies and confront the enduring challenges, including biointegration, sustainable power, and regulatory translation, that must be overcome for clinical adoption. By threading the narrative through the lens of material innovation, this review not only surveys the current landscape but also provides a unique materials&#8208; and engineering&#8208;oriented perspective, aiming to chart a roadmap for next&#8208;generation autonomous and personalized medicine.

         <title>A High Energy Density Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Pouch Cell Via Lignin&#8208;Based Ionic Conductive Binder With Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coordinating Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of biomass lignin&#8208;derived polymeric binders are developed for Li&#8208;S batteries via mimicking critical adhesive structures of mussel. Among these, Acidic amino acid phosphoserine grafted demethylated lignin eases the aggregation of lignin binder as well as bond active/conductive materials, endows the pouch cell with fast Li+ diffusion, high sulfur loading and an initial discharge capacity of 1.125 Ah.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;based binders exhibit outstanding advantages in maintaining electrode stability and suppressing the shuttle effect in lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery. However, their inherent insulation and poor dispersion severely hinder Li+ transport within electrode, resulting in slow S reaction kinetics and low energy density. Here, a series of lignin&#8208;based ionic conductive binders (DAL&#8208;AA) were synthesized by mussel&#8208;mimicking demethylation and amino acids grafting modifications on alkali lignin (AL). It is found that acidic amino acids, e.g. phosphoserine, more easily restructure the spatial conformation via electrostatic repulsion and steric effect. It significantly eases the aggregation of lignin binder as well as bond active/conductive materials. Li+ diffusion coefficient in corresponding electrode improves 40% and lithium polysulfide conversion effectively accelerates. The Li&#8211;S battery delivers an initial discharge capacity of 971 mAh&#183;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5 C and can stably run 500 cycles. Moreover, the high&#8208;loading pouch cell with a capacity of 1.125 Ah achieves gravimetric and volumetric energy densities of 328 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and 517 Wh&#183;L&#8722;1 respectively. This work provides guidance on designing high&#8208;loading cathodes for advanced Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Sculpting the Future of Bone: The Evolution of Absorbable Materials in Orthopedics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the current status of polymeric, ceramic, and metallic absorbable materials in orthopedic applications, and highlights several innovative strategies designed to enhance mechanical performance, control degradation, and promote bioactivity. We also discuss the progress and translational potential of absorbable materials in treating various clinical bone disorders.








ABSTRACT
The repair of bone defects remains a major clinical challenge, as autologous grafts are constrained by donor limitations and bioinert implants often necessitate secondary surgeries. Absorbable materials, including polymers, ceramics, and metals, are rapidly transforming orthopedic care by offering temporary support and synchronized degradation to match tissue regeneration. This review highlights cutting&#8208;edge advances in composite scaffolds that enhance mechanical integrity, degradation kinetics, and osteoinductivity. We further explore innovative systems integrating stimuli&#8208;responsive smart materials (e.g., photothermal, piezoelectric), 4D printing smart materials, regenerative therapies, and bone organoids. Emerging clinical data are discussed in the context of diseases such as osteonecrosis, osteomyelitis, and osteoporosis. Looking forward, we outline transformative directions, including AI&#8208;driven scaffold design, gradient architectures, and immunomodulatory strategies to resolve the spatiotemporal mismatch between degradation and regeneration. This review offers a forward&#8208;looking framework for next&#8208;generation multifunctional, bioresponsive orthopedic implants.

         <title>Innate Immune&#8208;Cloaked Microgel&#8208;Coated Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reverse Persistent Pulmonary Fibrosis via Reparative Macrophages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft microgel coating is developed with a &#8220;self&#8221; peptide that helps mesenchymal stromal cells evade innate immune clearance. These engineered cells reverse fibrosis through secreted signals. Single&#8208;cell analysis reveals a special macrophage type that drives healing. This approach enables a living pharmacy for long&#8208;term tissue repair.








Abstract
The innate immune system plays a dual role in both mediating pathogenic processes following tissue damage and acting as a barrier to effective therapeutic delivery. Strategies that evade immune clearance while modulating host immune components offer promising solutions for treating complex chronic diseases, such as fibrosis. Here, an innate immune checkpoint material&#8208;based strategy is presented in which mesenchymal stromal cells, coated with a soft conformal microgel and functionalized with the CD47 self&#8208;marker agonist, effectively evade clearance by tissue resident macrophages. These engineered cells reverse persistent fibrotic damage in the lungs through a paracrine mechanism. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing identifies a transitional antigen&#8208;presenting macrophage subpopulation that mediates these reparative effects. By combining immune cloaking with the presentation of local signals encoded in the gel coatings, this strategy can be used to design secretory cells for long&#8208;term tissue remodeling, enabling a living pharmacy for chronic tissue damage.

         <title>Adaptive Metaskins for Active and Passive Thermal Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the synergistic integration of reconfigurable MXene micro&#8208;wrinkles and a temperature&#8208;sensitive substrate, an adaptive metaskin that can operate in either active or passive modes is proposed for multi&#8208;scenario IR camouflage. This coupling design enables reversible, continuous, controllable, and wide&#8208;range emissivity modulation, ensuring robust adaptability across diverse thermal environments, opening up an additional degree of freedom in IR camouflage applications.








Abstract
Dynamic thermal camouflage conceals objects from infrared detection by modulating surface emissivity to match the thermal signature of the background. However, existing emissivity modulation systems fail to perform effectively across both hot backgrounds, such as sun&#8208;heated buildings and roads, and cold backgrounds, such as open fields. Here, an adaptive metaskin capable of operating in either active (externally powered) or passive mode is demonstrated, enabling effective camouflage across diverse thermal environments. This is achieved through the synergistic integration of a plasmonic MXene metasurface and a reprogrammable liquid crystal elastomer. The metaskin offers both a wide, continuously tunable emissivity range (&#8776;41%) and a rapid temperature response (1.2 s), selectively triggered in the passive mode. In cold backgrounds (e.g., 20&#160;&#176;C), the system operates in an active mode, delivering a non&#8208;volatile low&#8208;emissivity state that conceals objects across a wide temperature range (e.g., 20&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C). In hot backgrounds (e.g., 50&#160;&#176;C), it switches to passive mode, autonomously modulating its emissivity and maintaining an average infrared contrast of just 4.7&#160;&#176;C for objects of 50&#8211;120&#160;&#176;C. This dual&#8208;mode design is expected to address the challenges of active and passive thermal camouflage, opening new possibilities for dynamic thermal radiation management.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Glass&#8208;Unified MOF Membranes for High&#8208;Efficiency Molecular Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy enables the fabrication of defect&#8208;free MOF membranes through integration with melt&#8208;quenched coordination polymer glass. These advanced membranes possess densely interconnected nanochannels that facilitate high&#8208;efficiency molecular separations in organic solvent nanofiltration, pervaporation, and gas separation, respectively, and tunable separation performance through non&#8208;destructive modification.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) demonstrate significant potential as separation membranes in energy&#8208;efficient industrial applications. Nevertheless, fabricating an arbitrary MOF membrane with intrinsic separation capability remains a persistent challenge due to intercrystalline defects, necessitating case&#8208;specific optimization of synthesis conditions for different separation targets. Herein, the first coordination polymer (CP) glass&#8208;unified MOF (GUM) membranes are fabricated by a melt&#8208;quenching approach, establishing a tunable and facile strategy for on&#8208;demand MOF membrane fabrication. The three types of Zr&#8208;GUM, Al&#8208;GUM, and Zn&#8208;GUM membranes with different Zr&#8208;, Al&#8208;, Zn&#8208;MOFs are defect&#8208;free and feature high&#8208;density, interconnected, selective nanochannels that dominate the transport process. This strategy enables precise and rapid molecular separation in organic solvent nanofiltration, isomer pervaporation, and gas separation. Meanwhile, through non&#8208;destructive modification of MOF crystals, the separation performance can be precisely fine&#8208;tuned without compromising the structural integrity of the GUM membrane. Furthermore, leveraging the meltability of CP glass, this strategy enables the fabrication of innovative defect&#8208;free membranes with integrated self&#8208;healing properties. The GUM membranes demonstrate sustained high&#8208;efficiency separation performance coupled with exceptional mechanical robustness, chemical resistance, and thermal stability, providing a facile strategy for both gas and liquid membrane separations.

         <title>Ultrasound Active Piezoelectric Nanostimulators for Long&#8208;Acting Wireless Deep Brain Electric Stimulation to Inhibit Epileptic Seizures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles are explored as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation. These nanostimulators can adhere to the neuronal membrane and generate electrical signals under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound to precisely activate neurons and associated neural circuits through triggering voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels. Piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based stimulation can effectively suppress epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models.








Abstract
Electrical deep brain stimulation is effective for epilepsy suppression, but will lead to neural tissue damage and inflammation due to implantation of electrodes and a pulse generator. Transcranial magnetic and transcranial ultrasound stimulation cannot directly generate effective electrical signals in deep brain regions. Here, the use of piezoelectric nanoparticles is proposed as wireless nanostimulators for deep brain electrical stimulation and minimally invasive suppression of epilepsy. Polydopamine&#8208;coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanostimulators can adhere to neuronal membrane and generate pulsed electrical signals under ultrasound irradiation, effectively activating neurons through modulating voltage&#8208;gated calcium channels on the membrane. These nanostimulators can be minimal&#8208;invasively implanted into target deep brain regions, such as the hippocampal CA1, through stereotactic microinjection and remain stable for at least 14 weeks with negligible inflammatory reactions. These implanted nanostimulators precisely and effectively activate surrounding neurons and associated neural circuits in vivo under a portable low&#8208;intensity ultrasound transducer. This piezoelectric nanostimulator&#8208;based wireless deep brain electrical stimulation effectively suppresses epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine&#8208;induced epilepsy rat models. By combining the deep penetration of ultrasound with the efficacy of piezoelectric stimulation, this minimally invasive method holds great promise for effective suppression of epileptic seizures and management of other neural disorders.

Polydopamine-coated barium titanate piezoelectric nanostimulators can adhere to neuronal membrane and generate pulsed electrical signals under ultrasound irradiation, effectively activating neurons through modulating voltage-gated calcium channels on the membrane. These nanostimulators can be minimal-invasively implanted into target deep brain regions, such as the hippocampal CA1, through stereotactic microinjection and remain stable for at least 14 weeks with negligible inflammatory reactions. These implanted nanostimulators precisely and effectively activate surrounding neurons and associated neural circuits in vivo under a portable low-intensity ultrasound transducer. This piezoelectric nanostimulator-based wireless deep brain electrical stimulation effectively suppresses epileptic seizures in both optogenetic and pilocarpine-induced epilepsy rat models. By combining the deep penetration of ultrasound with the efficacy of piezoelectric stimulation, this minimally invasive method holds great promise for effective suppression of epileptic seizures and management of other neural disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Heterogeneous Wettability Triboelectric Sensors for Sweat Collection and Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bioinspired triboelectric material with heterogeneous wettability, which is used to construct a lightweight, self&#8208;powered wearable sweat sensor. By integrating an ion&#8208;selective membrane and a wireless transmission module, the device enables selective detection of salt ions and real&#8208;time remote monitoring, offering notable potential for long&#8208;term, continuous health monitoring applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric sweat sensors, endowed with the technical advantages of non&#8208;invasive ex vivo and in situ detection, have catalyzed the rapid advancement of personalized medicine and precision health management systems. However, the inherently low secretion rate and rapid evaporation of sweat pose significant challenges for its efficient collection and rapid analytical screening. This study leverages laser cutting and aqueous interfacial self&#8208;assembly strategies to develop a biomimetic heterogeneous wettability triboelectric material (HWTM). Sweat is rapidly collected from the edge to the center of the material, driven by the combined effect of a wettability gradient and the Laplace pressure difference arising from asymmetric curvature at the liquid&#8208;solid interface. This collection mechanism markedly enriches target analytes, yielding a signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) of 51&#160;dB, which surpasses that of prevailing sweat sensor technologies. A portable wearable patch is engineered by integrating ion&#8208;selective membranes and data processing modules, enabling selective salt ion profiling and real&#8208;time wireless monitoring. This work paves the way for the rational design of sweat sensors grounded in fluidic transport mechanisms.

         <title>Unique Impacts of Scandium Doping on Electrode Performance of P&#8217;2&#8208; and P2&#8208;type Na2/3MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural stability during electrochemical cycling for P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3MnO2 as a positive electrode for of Na&#8208;ion battery is investigated by modulating the materials via metal substitution and varying the degree of Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion. The cycle stability is maximized when combining Sc doping and the lattice distortion, demonstrating &gt; 300 cycles in the coin&#8208;type full cell.








Abstract

Layered sodium manganese oxides are one of the promising candidates as cathode materials for high&#8208;capacity Na&#8208;ion batteries free from rare elements. Among the polytypes of layered sodium manganese oxides, the P&#8217;2&#8208;type Na2/3MnO2&#160;electrode exhibits the highest reversible capacity &#8776;220 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 based on the Mn3+/4+&#160;redox couple; however, the cycle life remained&#160;a significant challenge. Because of Jahn&#8208;Teller (JT) active Mn3+&#160;ions ([Ar]4s23d4), the layered structure is cooperatively distorted and experiences complex structural changes during Mn3+/4+&#160;redox accompanied by Na extraction/insertion. The impact of scandium(III) dopant in Na2/3[Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2&#160;on the cooperative lattice&#8208;distortion and electrode performance is systematically investigated, and prepartion for distortion&#8208;free hexagonal P2&#8208;type Na2/3[(Mn1&#8208;xScx)0.93&#9633;0.07]O2&#160;(&#9633; = vacancy) allows the contribution of the vacancies on the Mn site to be checked. Furthermore, a comparative study of the case of other trivalent metals of yttrium(III) and aluminum(III) as dopants is demonstrated. Thus, it is concluded that a unique synergetic effect of the Sc doping and JT distortion provides significant improvement of redox activity of P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3[Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2, demonstrating stable cycling for more than 300 cycles in a Na&#8208;ion cell. The findings highlight the critical role of the coexistence of the Sc dopant and honeycomb ordering of MnIV(MnIII1&#8208;xScIIIx) in [Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2&#160;slabs of P&#8217;2&#8208;Na2/3[Mn1&#8208;xScx]O2 on the stable redox for long&#8208;life Na&#8208;ion batteries.

This adaptive metaskin integrates a plasmonic MXene metasurface with a temperature&#8208;responsive liquid crystal elastomer to realize dual&#8208;mode active and passive thermal camouflage. It enables important objects, such as vehicles and personnel, to precisely match the thermal signatures of both low&#8208; and high&#8208;temperature backgrounds, achieving seamless blending with the environment and evading infrared detection. More details can be found in the Research Article by Keqiao Li, Yang Li, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202506934).

Interface Segregation in Dielectrics
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202507233), Sung&#8208;Yoon Chung and co&#8208;workers overturn the long&#8208;standing reliance on multiple additives and costly rare&#8208;earth elements in MLCCs by demonstrating that a single acceptor&#8208;type additive enables superior dielectric performance. Through atomic&#8208;scale grain&#8208;boundary segregation in nanocrystalline BaTiO3, they achieve dielectric loss below 0.8% up to 100 MHz and under 2.5% up to 1 GHz, while maintaining high effective permittivity even under electric fields as high as 80 kV/cm and exhibiting excellent temperature stability.

Engineering Aging
This illustration is a metaphorical representation of in vitro aging models. The engineers (cells) start their careers working with robust, well&#8208;maintained equipment (healthy tissue), and as time passes, they grow older, and their equipment eventually fails. These elements combine to form an accelerated aging model that can be studied to uncover some of the mysteries of the aging process. More details can be found in the Perspective by Khoon S. Lim and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202512523).

Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503524), Behnam Akhavan and co&#8208;workers address the long&#8208;standing challenge of bonding hydrogels to solid polymer substrates by introducing a universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy using plasma&#8208;generated reactive oxygen species. This scalable, linker&#8208;free method enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.

Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202511754), Ferhat Katmis, Valeria Lauter, Mehmet C. Onbasli, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field stabilization of interfacial skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings in EuS/Bi2Se3/EuS trilayers. Interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interactions and geometric confinement enable robust topological spin textures directly imaged by Lorentz TEM and confirmed by micromagnetic models, magnetometry and neutron reflectometry. These findings establish a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic technologies based on stable topological information carriers.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in Engineered Living Materials are highlighted, integrating synthetic biology and advanced materials, with a focus on probiotic&#8208;based therapeutics. Probiotic Living Materials hold great potential for biosensing, infection treatment, osteogenesis, wound healing, vaginal and gastrointestinal disorders, and cancer therapy. breakthroughs in the field is critically reviewed, including challenges for clinical translation.








Abstract
The growing demand for safer, more targeted therapeutics requires the development of advanced biomaterials. Among these, Engineered Living Materials (ELMs)&#8212;which integrate synthetic biology with material science&#8212;are emerging as promising platforms for biomedical applications. This review focuses on a subclass of ELMs based on genetically engineered probiotics combined with matrices, that are termed Probiotic Living Materials (PLMs) to differentiate them from Living Biotherapeutic Products (LBPs). Recent studies highlight PLM's potential in addressing different health conditions, offering targeted and dynamic therapies. However, PLMs face multiple challenges to be implemented in clinics, including a lack of robust genetic toolkits for probiotic engineering, concerns about biosafety (e.g., horizontal gene transfer or non&#8208;desirable biological activity), difficulties in translating preclinical results to humans, and the absence of clear regulatory guidance for clinical use. This review first explores the fundamental features of ELMs, then provides an overview of probiotics, followed by recent advances in the design of engineered PLMs for biomedical applications, particularly in biosensing development, infection treatment, bone repair, wound healing, vaginal imbalances, gut&#8208;related conditions, and cancer therapy. Finally, biosafety issues and current gaps in regulatory frameworks to ensure safe and effective use of PLMs, with a particular focus on vulnerable populations, are discussed.

         <title>Bioactive Materials&#8208;Mediated Regulation of Bone Marrow Microenvironment: Mechanistic Insights and Therapeutic Potentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in biomaterials that regulate the bone marrow microenvironment (encompassing osteocytes, stem cells, immune cells, nerves, and blood vessels). It introduces the action mechanisms of various materials and the limitations of current research, while outlining the development potential of biomaterials and their transformative impacts on medical paradigms.








Abstract
The bone marrow microenvironment(BME) maintains bone homeostasis through multi&#8208;cellular cooperation and signal crosstalk, its&#160;dysregulation drives&#160;pathological bone&#160;loss. In recent years, Materiobiology, a scientific discipline studying how biomaterial properties affect biological functions, has opened new avenues for the precise regulation of this complex microenvironment. Biomaterials enable sophisticated regulation of the BME through biomimetic design and functionalization strategies. They not only activate osteoblast signaling pathways to promote bone formation but also inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption functions. Additionally, they integrate nerve and vascular regeneration processes with immunomodulatory mechanisms to optimize stem cell behavior and improve the tissue repair microenvironment. This review comprehensively summarizes advances in biomaterial&#8208;mediated BME regulation, emphasizing interdisciplinary integration and intelligent material development to overcome the limitations of conventional therapies. The innovation of intelligent materials lies in their ability to mimic biological systems. Recent research has leveraged generative design models to engineer new thiol&#8208;containing antimicrobial peptides. These approaches achieve spatiotemporal coordination of cellular interactions and functional reconstruction during bone regeneration. Future efforts need to address challenges in material stability, personalized adaptation, and clinical translation, promoting cross&#8208;scale therapeutic innovation from molecular intervention to tissue regeneration, providing revolutionary solutions for bone metabolic diseases and complex defect repair.

         <title>Diverse Perovskite Solar Cells: Progress, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress, challenges, and perspectives for diverse categories of perovskite solar cells classified according to composition, dimension, and crystallinity are overviewed.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have revolutionized optoelectronics by virtue of their tunable bandgaps, exceptional optoelectronic properties, and structural flexibility. Notably, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance of perovskite solar cells has reached 27%, making perovskite materials a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. Although numerous reviews regarding perovskite materials have been published, the existing reviews generally focus on individual material systems (e.g., organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites) and specific optimizations in one particular optoelectronic application (e.g., stability engineering for solar cells), lacking a systematic overview of the progress and challenges across diverse perovskite types. This review breaks this limitation by providing a systematic overview of all perovskite categories used in solar cells classified by different criteria, including composition (organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, all&#8208;inorganic perovskites, lead&#8208;free perovskites, and metal&#8208;free perovskites), dimensionality (3D and low&#8208;dimensional perovskitoids), and crystallinity (poly&#8208;crystal thin film and single&#8208;crystal perovskites). The recent progress and future perspectives for each category of perovskite solar cells are focused on, aiming to establish a holistic roadmap for perovskite solar cells toward technological innovations and industrial viability.

         <title>Hierarchically MOF&#8208;Based Porous Monolith Composites for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the design of hierarchical porous materials for atmospheric water harvesting, focusing on metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous monoliths. Emphasis is placed on integrating MOF nanoscale porosity with the microscale channels of monolithic scaffolds to enhance sorption&#8208;desorption performance. The role of multiscale porosity, from the nanometer scale to the macrostructure, is highlighted in optimizing water uptake, vapor transport, and stability under varying humidity.








Abstract
Water scarcity, a critical global challenge, has intensified due to the adverse effects of climate change on ecosystems and its detrimental impact on human activities. Addressing this issue requires solutions capable of providing clean water in regions facing hydroclimatic challenges and limited infrastructure. Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising solution, particularly in arid regions, by extracting moisture from the air. This review explores AWH technologies that leverage material porosity and hygroscopicity, focusing on highly porous materials such as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) and monolithic scaffolds. While MOFs exhibit exceptional water uptake due to their tunable chemistry and nanoscale porosity, their powdery nature poses stability and processability challenges. To overcome these limitations, integrating MOFs into multiscale porous monoliths&#8212;such as foams, aerogels, cryogels, and xerogels&#8212;enhances structural integrity and performance. The role of hierarchical porosity, engineered across nano&#8208;scale in MOF (&lt;2 nm) and micro&#8208;scales (&gt;2 nm) is emphasized in porous monoliths, in optimizing water capture efficiency. This review also highlights recent advancements in MOF&#8208;based composite monoliths, their working mechanisms, and the potential for large&#8208;scale implementation. By integrating nanotechnology with material chemistry, this work outlines strategies to enhance sorption capacity, desorption kinetics, and scalability, ultimately providing a roadmap for developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable AWH systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Electrocatalytic Materials in Zn&#8208;Air Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs)&#8208;based electrocatalysts for Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) applications, systematically addressing their physicochemical characteristics, design paradigms, characterization techniques, and cutting&#8208;edge advancements. The current review can provide a valuable foundation for the selection of elements and the design of HEMs for bifunctional catalysts, as well as for the optimization of HEM compositions to enhance their intrinsic activity.








Abstract
Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have garnered significant attention owing to their high energy density, low costs, and environmental sustainability by using air as the cathode and zinc as the anode. The critical bottlenecks in advancing rechargeable ZABs lie in the development of high&#8208;performance bifunctional air electrode catalysts that efficiently drive the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), comprising four or more elements with distinctive structural characteristics, tailorable chemical compositions, and correspondingly tunable functional properties, have exhibited exceptional electrocatalytic activity toward ORR/OER in various catalytic systems. To further enhance HEMs' catalytic performance, systematic investigations into elemental interactions, precise identification of active sites, and elucidation of fundamental reaction mechanisms are imperative. This review first introduces the synthetic methods, design principles, and characterization technologies of HEM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and summarizes their applications in ZABs based on oxygen chemistry. This study endeavors to decode the complexity of active sites, elemental interactions, and the reaction mechanisms intrinsic to HEMs. Finally, the critical challenges, the significance of integrating both experimental and theoretical approaches, and the prospective applications of HEMs in ZABs are emphasized. This review is expected to facilitate the rational design and practical deployment of HEMs for next&#8208;generation ZAB systems.

         <title>Tailoring Advanced Metal&#8208;Based Nanomedicines for Adaptable Nanodynamic Disease Therapies and Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advances in metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (MBNs) as multifunctional platforms for next&#8208;generation diagnostics and nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), highlighting their structural tunability, diverse therapeutic modalities, and broad biomedical applications in oncology and infectious disease control. This review comprehensively emphasizes the design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and synergistic treatment strategies of emerging MBN, while also addressing current facing challenges in clinical translation.








Abstract
Advanced metal&#8208;based nanomaterials (MBNs) represent a dynamic frontier in nanomedicine, offering a versatile platform for next&#8208;generation diagnostics and therapeutics. Their tunable structures and catalytic, optical, and magnetic properties enable diverse nanodynamic therapies (NDTs), including photodynamic, chemodynamic, sonodynamic, thermodynamic, piezoelectric, radiodynamic, and magnetodynamic modalities. In addition to the well&#8208;established tumor ablation, MBNs also feature potent antimicrobial and antiviral activity, functioning via reactive oxygen species generation, immune modulation, and biofilm disruption. Recent developments in metal&#8211;organic frameworks, metal&#8211;phenolic networks, and 2D metal nanosheets have expanded the toolkit for precision drug delivery, imaging&#8208;guided therapy, and bioresponsive release strategies. This comprehensive review highlights the structural design principles, therapeutic mechanisms, and versatile biomedical applications of emerging MBN platforms, emphasizing synergistic treatment strategies and their role in overcoming hypoxia, multidrug resistance, and immunosuppression. Despite their promise, clinical translation remains hindered by unresolved issues in long&#8208;term biosafety, biodegradation, and scalable manufacturing. Future efforts are expected to focus on tailoring intelligent nanostructures with optimized pharmacokinetics, integrating multimodal imaging with real&#8208;time therapeutic feedback, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Continued innovation at the interface of materials science, biology, and medicine will be essential for transforming MBN&#8208;based systems into clinically viable tools for oncology, infectious disease control, and personalized medicine.

         <title>Advanced Electrolyte Engineering for Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review dissects the primary failure mechanisms of sodium&#8208;ion battery electrolytes at low temperatures, such as sluggish ion transport and high interfacial resistance. It comprehensively summarizes key optimization strategies, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, and the development of novel additives and salts, offering a systematic guide for designing advanced electrolytes for reliable low&#8208;temperature energy storage.








Abstract
Given the abundance and low cost of sodium resources, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are considered promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Moreover, the unique electrochemical and chemical characteristics of SIBs indicate their substantial potential for low&#8208;temperature operation. However, low temperatures significantly reduce the intrinsic Na+ transport rate, sharply increase the Na+ de&#8208;solvation energy barrier at the battery&#8208;electrolyte interface, and lead to dynamic solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) reconstruction, resulting in a substantial increase in interfacial impedance. These issues ultimately lead to severe capacity degradation, diminished power performance, shortened cycle life, and even complete battery failure at low temperatures. To address these challenges, this review thoroughly analyzes the failure mechanisms of electrolytes at low temperatures and comprehensively summarizes current design and optimization strategies for low&#8208;temperature SIB electrolytes, including solvent engineering, concentration regulation, novel additives and sodium salts, and emerging electrolyte systems. Furthermore, it prospects the future development trends of organic electrolytes, aiming to provide insights for the advancement of novel low&#8208;temperature SIBs.

         <title>Optical, Electrical, Thermal, Stress, and Energy Yield Simulations Enhance the Performance and Stability of Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Device simulations are essential for uncovering efficiency losses and failure pathways in perovskite solar cells. This review summarizes device simulations across five fundamental domains, including optical management, electrical processes, thermal effects, mechanical stress, and energy output. In addition, it provides insight into high&#8208;throughput and AI&#8208;assisted multiphysics modeling in advancing future photovoltaic technologies.








Abstract
Device simulations have become indispensable tools for advancing the performance and deepening the understanding of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These simulations enable a systematic exploration of light management strategies, charge transport mechanisms, and device architecture optimization. This review comprehensively highlights the critical role of modeling in the development of PSCs, with a focus on five key domains: optical management (light absorption, reflection, and scattering), electrical processes (carrier dynamics, defect passivation, and interface engineering), thermal effects (heat generation and dissipation), mechanical stress (structural stability and degradation mechanisms), and energy yield (real&#8208;world output power, performance improvement, and device degradation). The integration of multiphysics simulations to address complex device challenges and to accelerate the development of high&#8208;efficiency and stable PSCs is also discussed. Key achievements in tandem architecture optimization, interface engineering, and insights into device degradation pathways under real&#8208;world operating conditions are thoroughly summarized. Finally, remaining challenges, such as modeling non&#8208;idealities, the scalability of simulation approaches, and experimental validation, are identified, and offer an outlook on future directions in multiphysics modeling. By bridging theoretical and experimental perspectives, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of simulations in enabling higher performance, enhanced stability, and broader application of perovskite photovoltaics (PV) in sustainable energy systems.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Direct Lithium Extraction from Low&#8208;Quality Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review synthesizes the structure&#8208;efficiency&#8208;application framework of solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems for lithium extraction from low&#8208;quality brines. It highlights fundamental mechanisms, integrated design, engineering applications, and device development of SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. The challenges and future perspective for the next generation of scale&#8208;up SDLE architectures are also supplemented.








Abstract
Owing to the crucial role in energy transformation for decarbonization, sustainable lithium (Li) supply has become growingly critical. Low&#8208;quality brines hold vast potential due to infinite reserves and diverse distribution but desire green and cost&#8208;effective extraction techniques against low Li concentrations and high magnesium&#8208;to&#8208;lithium ratios. Solar&#8208;driven direct lithium extraction (SDLE) systems combining conventional evaporation and DLE techniques can overcome the present challenges of Li extraction, promising to advance the exploitation of low&#8208;quality brines while simultaneously producing fresh water. However, the underlying construction principles and fundamental physical processes concerning SDLE systems are still uncovered comprehensively. This review first reveals the high&#8208;efficient and energy&#8208;effective Li extraction mechanisms from low&#8208;quality brines. Then, this work systematically presents construction and enhancement strategies, and the latest advancements and engineering applications of various SDLE systems, covering adsorption, membrane separation, crystallization separation, and electrochemical extraction. Furthermore, this work highlights the rational design of SDLE devices for water&#8208;Li co&#8208;production. Finally, this work discusses the challenges and future prospects for realizing SDLE systems from lab discovery to scale&#8208;up field demonstration. This review aims to bridge the gap between fundamental science and practical engineering behind the SDLE, unlocking different insights for resource sustainability and low&#8208;grade brines mining.

         <title>Terahertz Electronic and Spin Currents in Wafer&#8208;Scale Van der Waals Bi2Se3/WSe2 Heterostructures and Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterostructures offer exciting possibilities for artificial materials with unique optical, electronic, and spintronic properties. However, their use in the terahertz (THz) range is limited due to material constraints. This study demonstrates scalable, large&#8208;area, crystalline 2D heterostructures, combining topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and ferromagnets. This enables a range of THz phenomena from spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, nonlinear down&#8208;conversion and magnetic proximity effects in a single heterostructure stack.

Van der Waals heterostructures and polymorphs have promised the realization of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, through an infinitely diverse set of 2D quantum materials and their stacking order in a single layered device. However, their exploitation for the terahertz range has been limited with most investigations based around the optical domain, owing to the use of exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, the combination of terahertz electronic and spin currents is demonstrated through the realization of large area complex crystalline heterostructures of topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and ferromagnets. This is demonstrated through down&#8208;conversion of optical beams into coherent terahertz currents, where the terahertz phase permits the decoupling of the physical phenomena, and bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, the role of different TMD polymorphs (stacking orders &#8208; 1T&#8242;, 2H, and 3R) is shown with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the material stack entirely changing the terahertz responses &#8211; both electrical and magnetic &#8208; of the artificial material. This allows to highlight ultrafast phenomena that combine both the electronic&#8208; and spin&#8208;based processes in these structures. The importance of the crystal symmetry on the magnetic properties through proximity effects is further demonstrated, showing a nonlinearity of magnetic origin as a result of the 1T&#8242; polymorph. As well as control of the terahertz currents through different polymorphs, this scalable integration of a set of highly diverse materials establishes a platform for next&#8208;generation 2D heterostructures that integrate photonic, electronic, and spintronic properties into device&#160;architectures.

&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals heterostructures offer exciting possibilities for artificial materials with unique optical, electronic, and spintronic properties. However, their use in the terahertz (THz) range is limited due to material constraints. This study demonstrates scalable, large-area, crystalline 2D heterostructures, combining topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD), and ferromagnets. This enables a range of THz phenomena from spin-to-charge conversion, nonlinear down-conversion and magnetic proximity effects in a single heterostructure stack. Further, different TMD polymorphs &#8211; the crystal phase - significantly alter the THz responses, providing a pathway for advanced heterostructure engineering in 2D materials.

         <title>Li&#8208;Well ZnO Memtransistors: High Reliability for Neuromorphic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lithium (Li)&#8208;well ZnO memtransistor integrates&#160;transistor switching and nonvolatile memory, akin to ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and floating gates, while enabling low&#8208;power operation via Li&#8314; ion migration. Li&#8314; ion migration and switching mechanisms were&#160;confirmed by 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array achieves 99.31% yield, and this scalable design supports neuromorphic computing and artificial neural network accelerators. 








Abstract
Memtransistors are active analog memory devices utilizing ionic memristive materials as channel layers. Since their introduction, the term &#8220;memtransistor&#8221; has widely been adopted for transistors exhibiting nonvolatile memory characteristics. Currently, memtransistor devices possessing both transistor on/off functionality and nonvolatile memory characteristics include ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistors (FeFETs) and charge&#8208;trap flash (floating gate), yet ionic memtransistors have not matched their performance. Here a facile and extendable lithium (Li)&#8208;well oxide memtransistor (LWOM) is reported as a promising candidate. Forming a Li well, analogous to an n+ well beneath electrodes in n&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistor (MOSFET) processes, induces Li&#8314;&#8208;ion migration via write VDS, achieving analog memory characteristics through Schottky barrier modulation. LWOM enables low&#8208;voltage weight updates and precise gate&#8208;controlled weight update characteristics. Analysis via 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) confirms Li&#8208;ion redistribution and the resistance&#8208;switching mechanism. A 21 &#215; 21 crossbar array demonstrates 99.31% operational yield and successful weight updates to target conductance values. Fabricated using mature oxide semiconductor technology with a 230&#160;&#176;C thermal budget and a simple process, LWOM stands as a strong contender for next&#8208;generation nonvolatile memory and artificial neural network (ANN) acceleration hardware.

         <title>Robust Textile&#8208;Based Electromagnetic Audio Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current wearable audio interfaces exhibit sound&#8208;emitting function but compromise either acoustic performance or wearability, and lack sufficient robustness against unstructured conditions. A textile&#8208;based audio interface is proposed with robust actuation to address these challenges and demonstrate various human&#8208;machine interactive applications. 








Abstract
Textiles with inherently porous architectures are commonly employed for acoustic absorption. Although recent advances in textile&#8208;based audio interfaces have enabled sound emission, they lack robustness under unstructured conditions. Therefore, this study introduces a strategy that integrates textile structures with a durable actuation mechanism to overcome these limitations. Through optimized theoretical modeling, this study enhances the vibration amplitudes, effectively compensating for the intrinsic acoustic damping losses of textiles, achieving a relatively high and flat sound pressure level of 71.7&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3&#160;dB. Notably, the audio interface maintains stable performance under various mechanical deformations, including stretching, compression, bending, and twisting. Furthermore, this audio interface preserves the essential characteristics of textiles, such as washability and breathability, and remains fully functional even in extremely humid conditions, such as heavy perspiration. The versatility of this approach is demonstrated through three practical applications: sound&#8208;beanie, talking&#8208;cloth, and sound&#8208;sofa. In each case, this audio interface delivers high&#8208;quality acoustic performance and robustness to unstructured conditions. The proposed strategy is anticipated to enhance the design of wearable audio interfaces for real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Current&#8208;Induced Magnetization Switching via 180&#176; N&#233;el Vector Reversal in Pt/Cr2O3/Co Trilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT)&#8208;induced switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector offers strong potential for ultrafast SOT&#8208;MRAM, though its mechanism remains debated. Here, such switching is reported in antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 within a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer. The switching occurs via antiferromagnetic domain wall motion, leading to unconventional SOT behaviors in the Co layer, including reversed polarity, current&#8208;induced exchange bias modulation, and field&#8208;cooling&#8208;dependent switching ratios.








Abstract
The 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector induced by the spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) presents significant potential for ultradense and ultrafast antiferromagnetic SOT&#8208;magnetoresistive random&#8208;access memory. However, its experimental realization remains a topic of intense debate. Here, unequivocal evidence is provided for the SOT&#8208;induced 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in collinear antiferromagnetic Cr2O3 in a Pt/Cr2O3/Co trilayer structure. It is demonstrated that the 180&#176; switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 can lead to the unconventional switching behavior of the Co layer on top of it. The switching polarity of the Co layer can be reversed after the insertion of the Cr2O3 layer. Moreover, the exchange bias directions are switched simultaneously with the Co layer. The switching ratio of the Co layer is sensitive to the antiferromagnetic states of Cr2O3 and can be tuned by field cooling. The results not only underpin the electrical switching of the perpendicular N&#233;el vector in Cr2O3 but are also beneficial for the development of antiferromagnetic&#8208;based devices.

Bone defect therapy frequently encounters bacterial infections and chronic inflammation, which impair bone regeneration and threaten implant stability. Iron oxide nanoparticles have attracted attention due to cost&#8208;effectiveness, biocompatibility, and metabolic safety. However, iron oxide nanoparticles still struggle to balance low&#8208;temperature efficient antibacterial activity, effective immunomodulation, and bone regeneration. Therefore, inspired by diatoms, a multifunctional bone repair scaffold based on chitosan&#8208;hydroxyapatite (CH) is developed by integrating the multifunctional properties of copper&#8208;doped iron goethite (Fe(Cu)OOH) nanoparticles and a mesoporous SiO2 protective layer (CH/FeCu@SiO2). The &#8220;cytoskeleton&#8221; CH scaffold stabilizes the nanoparticles and supports tissue growth. The &#8220;chloroplast&#8221; Fe(Cu)OOH and the &#8220; frustule&#8221; SiO2 layer synergistically capture near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light to generate localized mild hyperthermia (&#8776;42&#160;&#176;C), with the release of Cu2+ to achieve antibacterial effects (&gt;99%). In addition, Fe(Cu)OOH exhibits enzyme&#8208;like antioxidant activity, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) (69.20%) and thereby promoting M2 macrophage polarization (1.64&#8208;fold), which protects stem cells and creates osteogenic immune microenvironment. Moreover, the mild hyperthermia and ion release upregulate the TGF&#8208;&#946; signaling pathway and inhibit osteoclast differentiation, promoting vascularized bone regeneration and defect repair (1.3&#8208;fold). Overall, this biomimetic scaffold, enabling synergistic antibacterial, immunomodulatory, and osteogenic activities, offers a promising therapeutic strategy for infectious bone defects treatment.

         <title>Solubility&#8208;pKa Coupling Effect Tailored Nanoporous Nylon Aerogel Family with Multiple Thermomechanical Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling effect to engineer a high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By controlling nylon crystallization assembly, various nylon aerogels with robust nanofiber skeletons are developed comparable to traditional high&#8208;performance aerogels, while possessing unique thermoplastic characteristics for functional aerogel thermomechanical processing.








Abstract
Despite significant advancements in aerogels science, the fabrication of high&#8208;performance aerogels with their plastic processability remains unexplored owing to their inherent trade&#8208;off between skeletal rigidity and transformable processability. Herein, a universal solubility&#8208;pKa coupling&#8208;effect to engineer high&#8208;performance thermoplastic nylon aerogel family with excellent thermomechanical processing performance is proposed. By modulating solubility parameters and acid dissociation constants in nylon&#8208;solvent systems, it is precisely control crystallization to assemble interlaced 1D nanofiber skeletons, yielding nylon aerogels that integrate a high specific surface area (226&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), exceptional compressive modulus (12.6&#160;MPa), and ultralow thermal conductivity (0.034&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). Notably, beyond achieving performance comparable to aramid and other high&#8208;performance aerogels, these nylon aerogels uniquely incorporate thermoplastic properties enabling multiple thermomechanical processing for aerogel functionalization, including protective barrier via thermal encapsulating, reassembly of aerogel unmanned aerial vehicle through thermal cutting and welding, and biomimetic hydrophobic surfaces with lotus and petal effects through precise thermal imprinting. Surprisingly, thermomechanical processing also induces fluorescence of aerogels, suggesting applications in thermal&#8208;recording, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, etc. This research overcomes the critical skeletal rigidity&#8208;transformable processability trade&#8208;off in aerogels, enabling novel manufacturing approaches and broader engineering applications.

         <title>Preventing Glioblastoma Relapse by Igniting Innate Immunity through Mitochondrial Stress in the Surgical Cavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work synthesizes a charge&#8208;inversion nanodrug (INSTNA) that can activate innate immunity by interfering with the mitochondrial electron transport chain of tumor cells in the surgical cavity of GBM. Mechanistically, INSTNA coordinated tumor treatment fields (TTF) induce mitochondrial stress and release damage&#8208;related molecular patterns (DAMP) that amplify innate immunity and further activate adaptive immunity to kill GBM cells.








Abstract
Innate immunity is crucial in orchestrating the brain immune response, however, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to evade innate immune surveillance, posing significant challenges for current immunotherapies. Here, a therapeutic strategy is reported that aims at reactivating innate immune responses in GBM via targeted induction of mitochondrial stress, thereby enhancing tumor immunogenicity. Specifically, innate immune&#8208;stimulating nanoparticles (INSTNA) are developed, encapsulating positively charged iridium&#8208;based complexes (Ir&#8208;mito) and small interfering RNA against Methylation&#8208;Controlled J protein (si&#8208;MCJ) to attenuate mitochondrial respiration. This combination effectively disrupts mitochondrial function of GBM cells, particularly when combined with tumor&#8208;treating fields. The engineered charge&#8208;reversal INSTNA impair the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), inducing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) stress and subsequent mitochondrial matrix release. Furthermore, hydrogel&#8208;mediated delivery of INSTNA in a postoperative GBM mouse model significantly remodeled the immunosuppressive microenvironment, resulting in pronounced tumor regression. In sum, these findings highlight that targeted induction of mitochondrial stress in postoperative GBM can potentiate innate immune activation and enhance adaptive immunity, offering a promising avenue for mitigating GBM recurrence.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Tunable Fluorinated Polyester Electrolytes with Enhanced Interfacial Stability for Recyclable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated polyesters are shown to regulate lithium&#8208;ion coordination and promote stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. The rational structural design enables uniform lithium deposition, suppressed dendrite growth, and enhanced cycling performance in lithium&#8208;metal batteries. This work highlights the importance of molecular engineering in developing high&#8208;performance and sustainable electrolytes.








Abstract
Polyesters, with their tunable chemical structures and environmental sustainability, have drawn growing attention as solid polymer electrolytes for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs). Through a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study involving the systematic variation of carbon chain lengths in the flexible (diol) and coordinating (diacid) segments, along with selective fluorination at distinct positions along the polymer backbone, 18 types of polyester are fabricated and demonstrate that fluorination at the coordinating segment significantly enhances ionic conductivity by suppressing crystallinity. In contrast, fluorination at the flexible segment reduces ionic migration barriers by providing more homogeneous coordinating sites, thereby improving the lithium&#8208;ion transference number, despite increasing chain rigidity and a reduction in overall ionic conductivity. The optimized fluorinated polyesters exhibit excellent interfacial stability with lithium metal by facilitating the formation of a LiF&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, as supported by experimental and theoretical simulation analysis. More importantly, to enhance cost&#8208;effectiveness and sustainability, a solvent&#8208;based recycling route has been developed, achieving substantial recovery yields and notable environmental benefits. This work provides a versatile molecular design and closed&#8208;loop recovery strategy for fluorinated polyester electrolytes, advancing their practical application in high&#8208;energy and sustainable SSLMBs.

         <title>Gbits/s&#8208;Level Encrypted Spectral Wireless Communication Enabled by High&#8208;Performance Flexible Organic Hyperspectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A&#160;novel spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology based on an organic hyperspectrometer is proposed. By analyzing the spectrum of information&#8208;carrying light in the time domain, binary information encoded in different wavelengths can be extracted. The theoretical communication rate reaches up to 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, representing the highest value reported to date for wireless optical communication based on organic photodetectors.








Abstract
The exponential growth of data in the information era has pushed conventional optical communication technology to its limitations, including inefficient spectral utilization, slow data rate, and inherent security vulnerabilities. Here, a transformative high&#8208;speed organic spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology enabled by a flexible, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance organic hyperspectrometer is proposed that integrates ultrahigh&#8208;speed data transmission with hardware&#8208;level encryption. By synergistically combining organic photodetector arrays with tunable responsivities and spectral&#8208;tunable organic filters, the organic hyperspectrometer achieves a broad spectral detection range of 400 to 900 nm, resolution of 1.08 nm, accuracy of 0.60 nm, and response time of 684 ns. Unlike prior optical wireless communication systems, the organic hyperspectrometer&#8208;based SWC platform uniquely decodes high&#8208;speed encrypted data at the hardware level, which is a breakthrough in secure, high&#8208;speed, and high&#8208;capacity communication. Harnessing the full visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectrum, the SWC system achieves a theoretical data rate of 9.1 Gbits s&#8722;1, ranking as the highest&#8208;speed organic optical communication system. Furthermore, the intrinsic flexibility and bandgap&#8208;tunability of organic materials enable unparalleled portability, adaptability, and scalability of organic SWC, establishing a scalable framework for terahertz&#8208;scale data transmission.

     alt="Gbits/s-Level Encrypted Spectral Wireless Communication Enabled by High-Performance Flexible Organic Hyperspectrometer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A&#160;novel spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology based on an organic hyperspectrometer is proposed. By analyzing the spectrum of information-carrying light in the time domain, binary information encoded in different wavelengths can be extracted. The theoretical communication rate reaches up to 9.1 Gbits s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the highest value reported to date for wireless optical communication based on organic photodetectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exponential growth of data in the information era has pushed conventional optical communication technology to its limitations, including inefficient spectral utilization, slow data rate, and inherent security vulnerabilities. Here, a transformative high-speed organic spectral wireless communication (SWC) technology enabled by a flexible, miniaturized, and high-performance organic hyperspectrometer is proposed that integrates ultrahigh-speed data transmission with hardware-level encryption. By synergistically combining organic photodetector arrays with tunable responsivities and spectral-tunable organic filters, the organic hyperspectrometer achieves a broad spectral detection range of 400 to 900 nm, resolution of 1.08 nm, accuracy of 0.60 nm, and response time of 684 ns. Unlike prior optical wireless communication systems, the organic hyperspectrometer-based SWC platform uniquely decodes high-speed encrypted data at the hardware level, which is a breakthrough in secure, high-speed, and high-capacity communication. Harnessing the full visible-to-near-infrared spectrum, the SWC system achieves a theoretical data rate of 9.1 Gbits s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, ranking as the highest-speed organic optical communication system. Furthermore, the intrinsic flexibility and bandgap-tunability of organic materials enable unparalleled portability, adaptability, and scalability of organic SWC, establishing a scalable framework for terahertz-scale data transmission. These advancements mark a pivotal leap toward secure, high-speed, and ultracompact optical networks for the future data- and AI-driven era.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Observation of &#957; = 5/2 Fractional Quantum Hall Effect in Trilayer Graphene Proximitized by V&#8208;Doped WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Even&#8208;denominator 5/2 fractional state in trilayer graphene/V&#8208;doped WSe2 heterostructure, mediated by proximitized magnetism, is demonstrated. An exceptionally high energy gap &#8710;5/2 (48 K) for the 5/2 state, significantly surpassing previous values in semiconductors and bilayer graphene (&#8710;5/2 &lt; 1 K) is reported. The large &#8710;5/2 is essential for probing the non&#8208;Abelian nature of the 5/2 state and has implications for fault&#8208;tolerant topological quantum computation.








Abstract
Graphene has long been a test bed for observing strongly correlated phenomena owing to its 2D nature and ability to host high carrier mobility. However, the lack of intrinsic magnetism and weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling limits its ability to host strong electronic correlations. Here, observation of strongly correlated phenomena in trilayer graphene (TLG) proximitized by a ferromagnetic V&#8208;doped WSe2 (V&#8208;WSe2) overlayer is reported. These include the emergence of an odd&#8208; and even&#8208;denominator fractional quantum Hall state at &#957;&#8197; = 5/2 and reentrant integer quantum Hall effect in the hole regime of the TLG, driven by proximate magnetism from the V&#8208;WSe2. A remarkably large activation energy gap (&#916;5/2 = 48 &#177; 5 K) for the 5/2 fractional state is observed, which is essential for probing its non&#8208;Abelian nature. Furthermore, the large &#916;5/2&#8197;significantly enhances its feasibility for topological quantum computation by exponentially suppressing the error rates. Additionally, the formation of three additional Dirac cones, termed Dirac &#8220;gullies,&#8221; is observed, which manifest as threefold&#8208;degenerate Landau levels in magnetotransport measurements. These findings not only advance the role of magnetism in graphene&#8208;based heterostructures but also open pathways toward studying non&#8208;Abelian quasiparticles for their exotic fundamental and technological implications.

         <title>Emergence of Polar Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pair Arrays in Multiferroic Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable 4.5&#160;nm&#8208;period polar vortex&#8211;antivortex arrays are realized in multiferroic/dielectric (BiFeO3/DyScO3) superlattices, which retain structural integrity above 350&#160;&#176;C, exhibit electrical switching, and display periodicity tunable via atomic&#8208;scale layer thickness control&#8212;offering a scalable platform for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density, low&#8208;power topological memory.








Abstract
Ferroelectric topologies, renowned for their nanoscale dimensions and external electric field tunability, are emerging as leading candidates for high&#8208;density, low&#8208;power memory devices in the Big Data era. While polar configurations such as vortices, flux&#8208;closure domains, center&#8208;type domains, skyrmions, and merons have been extensively explored, antivortices remain largely underdeveloped. In this work, the discovery and realization of stable polar vortex&#8208;antivortex pair arrays within multiferroic&#8208;dielectric superlattices are reported with integrated experimental and theoretical efforts, enabled by low&#8208;symmetry BiFeO3 with diagonal spontaneous polarization. By employing atomic&#8208;level engineering to precisely modulate the architecture of BiFeO3 layers, achieving unprecedented periodicities as small as 4.5&#160;nm. These arrays exhibit exceptional thermal stability, preserving their structural integrity above room temperature, and reversible polarization switching under applied electric fields. Additionally, the sensitivity of domain wall configurations to the dielectric layer thickness offers further tunability. These findings not only expand the scope of ferroelectric topologies but also provide a versatile platform for harnessing antivortices in practical applications, paving the way for next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;density, low&#8208;power memory technologies.

         <title>Universal Method for Covalent Attachment of Hydrogels to Diverse Polymeric Surfaces for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal, reagent&#8208;free strategy is presented for covalently attaching hydrogels to diverse polymeric substrates through reactive oxygen species. The scalable, linker&#8208;free approach enables robust adhesion and broad material compatibility, advancing the fabrication of hybrid solid&#8211;hydrogel systems for next&#8208;generation biomedical devices and bioprinting applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels, renowned for their biocompatibility and capacity to mimic biological tissues, are integral to many biomedical applications, such as implantable devices and wound dressings. However, their poor mechanical strength and the challenge of achieving durable adhesion to polymeric surfaces have hindered their broader utility. Current methods of creating hybrid solid&#8208;hydrogel (HSH) structures often rely on complex chemical linkers, adding steps, cytotoxic risks, and scalability issues. Here, a novel, reagent&#8208;free method that covalently bonds hydrogels to polymeric substrates directly via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by an atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is introduced. Through an evaporation&#8208;induced enhanced concentration (EIEC) approach, robust hydrogel layers are formed on ROS&#8208;functionalized surfaces, eliminating the need for silane&#8208;based linkers and achieving up to 60&#160;kPa adhesion strength in wet conditions. This strategy offers robust hydrogel adhesion, reduces processing complexity, and preserves cytocompatibility, as demonstrated by the culture of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and THP&#8208;1 derived macrophages with minimal immune response. Applicable across various hydrogels, such as gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), chitosan, and polymeric substrates, including Teflon, polyethylene, and polycaprolactone (PCL), this dry process holds substantial promise for integration into advanced biomanufacturing systems, such as 3D bioprinters, unlocking new potentials in tissue engineering and biomedical device fabrication.

         <title>Dynamic Regulation of Adaptive Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Molecules via B&#8592;N Coordination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamically tunable butterfly&#8208;shaped molecular system based on B&#8592;N coordination enables force&#8208;driven transitions between bistable stacking conformations. Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements reveal distinct charge transport mechanisms, which are modulated by external electric fields, substituent effects, and quantum interference effects. These findings highlight the potential of B&#8592;N interactions in designing multiunit functional molecular junctions with tailored electronic characteristics.








Abstract
Achieving dynamic control over stereostructures and electronic properties of rigid molecules remains a significant challenge due to the delicate balance between stability and flexibility. Here, the construction of butterfly&#8208;shaped molecular junctions stabilized by moderate&#8208;strength boron&#8208;nitrogen (B&#8592;N) coordination between boraacenes and pyridines is reported. By leveraging the pivot&#8208;like flexibility of B&#8592;N bonds, molecular conductance switching with on/off ratios exceeding 100 is achieved through force&#8208;driven dynamic transitions between distinct stacking conformations. Single&#8208;molecule electrical measurements combined with first&#8208;principle calculations identify distinct charge transport mechanisms&#8212;through&#8208;space and through&#8208;bond&#8212;associated with the butterfly&#8208;wing open and closed configurations. Furthermore, external factors like electric fields and substituent effects modulate &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions and charge transport properties. The introduction of destructive quantum interference effects can be achieved by replacing molecular units. The findings demonstrate that B&#8592;N coordination serves as a dynamically tunable linkage, offering a pathway to design molecular platforms with multifunctional units, customized stereo&#8208;conformations, and quantum effects.

By leveraging the pivot-like flexibility of B&#8592;N bonds, molecular conductance switching with on/off ratios exceeding 100 is achieved through force-driven dynamic transitions between distinct stacking conformations. Single-molecule electrical measurements combined with first-principle calculations identify distinct charge transport mechanisms&#8212;through-space and through-bond&#8212;associated with the butterfly-wing open and closed configurations. Furthermore, external factors like electric fields and substituent effects modulate &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt; interactions and charge transport properties. The introduction of destructive quantum interference effects can be achieved by replacing molecular units. The findings demonstrate that B&#8592;N coordination serves as a dynamically tunable linkage, offering a pathway to design molecular platforms with multifunctional units, customized stereo-conformations, and quantum effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Micromotors in Air Propelled by Thermal Convection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;driven micromotors in air can overcome gravity and generate convective motion by a light&#8208;induced thermal mechanism driven by a temperature gradient in the air caused by the interaction of the gold nanoparticles present on the surface of ZnO and NIR irradiation. NaGdF4:Er, Yb upconverting nanoparticles enable temperature quantification on the micromotors' surface through luminescence nanothermometry. Tracking of motion and speed quantification is achieved with a microscope camera, light scattering and software tracking. Schematic created using BioRender.








Abstract
Micromotors are an attractive cutting&#8208;edge technology that exhibit controllable motion in response to chemical reactions or external stimuli. These nature&#8208;inspired materials are widely explored for use in environmental remediation, and drug delivery, other emerging applications. Until now, the micromotors field is restricted to applications in aqueous environments, as achieving controllable motion in air while overcoming gravity remains a significant challenge. Herein, for the first time, to our knowledge, we introduce a system capable of overcoming gravity to achieve light&#8208;induced thermal convective motion in air, driven by near&#8208;infrared light excitation. The micromotors are composed of spiky, pollen&#8208;like ZnO microparticles coated with gold nanoparticles, which interact photothermally with the NIR light, generating a thermal gradient that induces propulsion of the micromotor system. Lanthanide&#8208;doped upconverting nanoparticles are deposited onto the micromotor surface to enable nanothermometric monitoring of surface temperature, providing critical information needed to describe the system's thermal behavior in air. This micromotor platform provides a versatile approach to overcome gravity and induce a controllable movement in a gaseous matrix, opening new opportunities to develop proof&#8208;of&#8208;concepts and applications using this aerodynamic micromotor approach.

         <title>Phase Stabilization of In2Se3 by Disordered Ni Intercalation and its Enhanced Thermoelectrical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that disordered Ni intercalation in In2Se3 stabilizes the phase structure, enhances electrical conductivity, and reduces thermal conductivity. This strategy improves the thermoelectric figure of merit ZT by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) at 500&#160;&#176;C, providing new insights for optimizing layered thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) layered materials have gained significant attention owing to their distinctive structure and unique properties. The weak interlayer bonding in vdW layered materials enables guest atom intercalation, allowing precise tuning of their physical and chemical properties. In this work, a ternary compound, NixIn2Se3 (x = 0&#8211;0.3), with Ni randomly occupying the interlayers of In2Se3, is synthesized via an intercalation route driven by electron injection. The intercalated Ni atoms act as &#8220;anchor points&#8221; within the interlayer of In2Se3, which effectively suppresses the phase transition of In2Se3 at elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the disordered Ni intercalation significantly enhanced the electrical conductivity of In2Se3 through electron injection, while reducing the thermal conductivity due to the interlayer phonon scattering, leading to an improved thermoelectric performance. For instance, the thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of Ni0.3In2Se3 increased by 86% (in&#8208;plane) and 222% (out&#8208;of&#8208;plane) compared to In2Se3 at 500&#160;&#176;C. These findings not only provide an effective strategy to enhance the performance of layered thermoelectric materials but also demonstrate the potential of intercalation chemistry for expanding the application scope of van der Waals (vdW) layered materials.

         <title>Anisotropic Optoelectronic Synapses in 2D Nb2GeTe4 for Direction&#8208;Programmable Neuromorphic Perception and Decision&#8208;Making</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuromorphic computing addresses the von Neumann bottleneck. Using anisotropic 2D Nb2GeTe4, dual electronic&#8208;optical synapses with directional plasticity are developed: 98.3% accuracy along a&#8208;axis vs 88.3% along b&#8208;axis under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation. This enables compact neuromorphic hardware with co&#8208;stimulation processing, demonstrated in high&#8208;accuracy machine vision (89.6%) and vehicle navigation (90.2%). It advances multimodal sensing for edge AI and robotics.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing presents a promising solution for the von Neumann bottleneck, enabling energy&#8208;efficient and intelligent sensing platforms. Although 2D materials are ideal for bioinspired neuromorphic devices, achieving multifunctional synaptic operations with simple configurations and linear weight updates remains challenging. Inspired by biological axons, the in&#8208;plane anisotropy of 2D Nb2GeTe4 is exploited to develop dual electronic&#8208;optical synaptic devices. The device exhibits anisotropic hole mobilities (137.97 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the a&#8208;axis and 78.29 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 along the b&#8208;axis) and a wavelength&#8208;dependent photoresponse. This enables directional synaptic plasticity under electrical&#8208;optical co&#8208;stimulation, achieving 98.3% accuracy along the a&#8208;axis and 88.3% along the b&#8208;axis in adaptive image processing. A machine vision system with 89.6% object recognition accuracy and an intelligent vehicle navigation platform with 90.2% decision&#8208;making accuracy is also demonstrated. The integration of anisotropic transport and spectrally tunable responses in a single material paves the way for compact neuromorphic hardware with multimodal sensing and parallel processing capabilities. This study advances 2D material&#8208;based neuroelectronics for edge computing, autonomous robotics, and adaptive artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Rich Niobium Oxide Sub&#8208;Nanoclusters Boosting Charge Transfer for Highly Reversible Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly unsaturated, sub&#8208;nanoscale niobium&#8208;oxide clusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon feature self&#8208;adaptive Nb4+/Nb5+ redox pairs that dynamically mediate polysulfide conversion in ether&#8208;based, room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur batteries. A distinct d&#8208;band center self&#8208;regulation mechanism simultaneously accelerates the sulfur&#8208;reduction and sulfur&#8208;oxidation half&#8208;reactions, sustaining high capacity with an ultra&#8208;low capacity&#8208;fade rate over 3000 cycles.








Abstract
Ether&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage system, yet hindered by the unregulated sulfur redox pathway, severe polysulfide shuttling and rapid capacity fading. Herein, highly unsaturated niobium&#8208;oxide sub&#8208;nanoclusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon black (NbOx&#8208;DCB) as a dynamic sulfur&#8208;conversion catalyst are introduced. The delocalized Nb d&#8208;electrons in the sub&#8208;nanocluster configuration create a mixed Nb4+/Nb5+ valence state that functions as a bidirectional electron reservoir, thereby enabling a distinct d&#8208;band&#8208;center self&#8208;regulation mechanism. The strong d&#8211;p orbital coupling enabled by a Nb4+&#8208;rich surface effectively captures sodium polysulfides and accelerates sulfur conversion kinetics during discharge, while a Nb5+&#8208;rich surface promotes facile solid&#8208;polysulfide decomposition during charging. Consequently, the NbOx&#8208;DCB/S cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 1184&#160;mAh&#160;gS&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles and retains 547&#160;mAh&#160;gS&#8722;1 after 3000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, corresponding to a decay rate of 0.0027% per cycle. The general applicability&#160;of this approach is validated by high&#8208;performance tungsten and vanadium oxide sub&#8208;nanocluster&#8208;based sulfur cathodes. These findings highlight sub&#8208;nanoscale metal&#8208;oxide engineering as a versatile route to high&#8208;performance RT Na&#8211;S batteries.

A distinct &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center self-regulation mechanism simultaneously accelerates the sulfur-reduction and sulfur-oxidation half-reactions, sustaining high capacity with an ultra-low capacity-fade rate over 3000 cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ether-based room-temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#9472;S) batteries are a promising energy-storage system, yet hindered by the unregulated sulfur redox pathway, severe polysulfide shuttling and rapid capacity fading. Herein, highly unsaturated niobium-oxide sub-nanoclusters (&#8776;0.7&#160;nm) anchored on defective carbon black (NbO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-DCB) as a dynamic sulfur-conversion catalyst are introduced. The delocalized Nb d-electrons in the sub-nanocluster configuration create a mixed Nb&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; valence state that functions as a bidirectional electron reservoir, thereby enabling a distinct &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band-center self-regulation mechanism. The strong &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital coupling enabled by a Nb&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;-rich surface effectively captures sodium polysulfides and accelerates sulfur conversion kinetics during discharge, while a Nb&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;-rich surface promotes facile solid-polysulfide decomposition during charging. Consequently, the NbO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-DCB/S cathode delivers a reversible capacity of 1184&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles and retains 547&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; after 3000 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, corresponding to a decay rate of 0.0027% per cycle. The general applicability&#160;of this approach is validated by high-performance tungsten and vanadium oxide sub-nanocluster-based sulfur cathodes. These findings highlight sub-nanoscale metal-oxide engineering as a versatile route to high-performance RT Na&#8211;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Competing Grain Growth Pathways in Anisotropic Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectric Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using in situ microscopy and simulations, this study unravels competing grain growth pathways in Bi2Te3&#8208;based nanoplates. It is found that pure Bi2Te3 nanoplates undergo predominantly surface&#8208;driven reshaping, while Sb&#8208;doping alters interfacial chemistry to promote collective grain merging. This work demonstrates how grain boundary modification can rationally steer microstructural evolution for advanced thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
Thermoelectric nanoplates derived from anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials such as Bi2Te3 are pivotal for flexible electronics and microscale thermal management. Their performance critically depends on grain boundary (GB) microstructure, but the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms governing grain growth in these highly anisotropic systems remain elusive. This particularly concerns the competition between individual nanoplate reshaping driven by facet stabilization and collective merging at GBs. Integrating in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, these competing pathways in pure Bi2Te3 (BT) and Sb&#8208;doped (BST) systems are unraveled. Undoped BT nanoplates preferentially undergo atomically localized reshaping, with atoms migrating from high&#8208;energy edges to stabilize low&#8208;energy facets. Conversely, Sb doping introduces Sb&#8208;Te interfacial phases that thermodynamically favor GB coalescence, thereby shifting the dominant pathway to collective merging. This work reveals how chemical modification steers GB evolution, determining whether reshaping or merging predominates. Such understanding is crucial for rationally designing anisotropic layered materials for applications in flexible electronics, topological materials, and energy&#8208;efficient devices.

         <title>Orderly Drawing Photo&#8208;Thermal Synergistic Electron Flow for Efficient CO2 Reduction under Natural Sunlight</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable Z&#8208;scheme FexInySz/TiO2 catalyst demonstrates 1.16&#160;% solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel efficiency for CO2 reduction under natural sunlight for four consecutive days, as photothermal synergy stretches electrons from O to Fe and optimizes active sites.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a green promising approach for CO2 reduction. Metal sulfides are widely studied in this field due to the high&#8208;efficiency, however, most of them are prone to photo&#8208;corrosion. Herein, a stable and efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction catalyst is reported, FexInySz/TiO2 owing an orderly drawing photo&#8208;thermal synergistic electron flow for CO2 reduction in a field experiment. The tests under natural sunlight conditions demonstrated that FexInySz/TiO2 has a stability of 4 natural days. The maximum photothermal energy conversion efficiency is 1.16%, which is the highest record under concentrated natural sunlight for CO2 reduction with pure water. The in situ rapid&#8208;scan XANES and XPS show the raising temperature and photo&#8208;irradiation synergistically stretch electrons from O to Fe, revealing the mechanism of thermal modulation to optimize the active sites for efficient and stable photocatalytic CO2 reduction. This work pioneers the stable and efficient reduction of CO2 under outdoor sunlight conditions, providing a theoretical foundation for the outdoor application of this technology.

         <title>Pure&#8208;Green Circularly Polarized Multiple Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Enantiomers with Discontinuous Fused Benzene Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circularly polarized multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) molecular engineering composed of discontinuous fused benzene rings is proposed, and obtains a pair of green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz. (P) and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based electroluminescence devices deliver pure&#8208;green emission peaking at 516&#160;nm, with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 37.3%/36.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Helicene&#8208;based circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials suffer from severely low color purity in circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs). Here, a novel molecular engineering strategy is introduced by replacing helicene containing continuous fused benzene rings with a multiple resonance (MR) framework comprising discontinuous fused benzene rings. This approach effectively suppresses high&#8208;frequency C&#9472;C bond stretching vibrations and enhances short&#8208;range charge transfer, enabling high color purity, CPL activity, and efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept green BN[7]helicene&#8208;based emitters (P/M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz display bright and narrowband green emission peaking at 512&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm. Notably, the enantiomers (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz exhibit narrowband CPL spectra with FWHMs of 26 and 25&#160;nm, the Commission Internationale de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.14, 0.72) and (0.15, 0.72), and photoluminescence dissymmetry factors of +2.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 and &#8722;2.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3. (P)&#8208; and (M)&#8208;DBN&#8208;mICz&#8208;based CP&#8208;OLEDs deliver pure&#8208;green emission, characterized by a peak wavelength of 516&#160;nm, a narrow FWHM of 27&#160;nm, and CIE coordinates of (0.17, 0.72), representing the purest green CP&#8208;OLEDs reported to date. Furthermore, these devices exhibit high electroluminescence dissymmetry factors of +5.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3/&#8722;8.5&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3, and maximum external quantum efficiencies of 37.3% and 36.6%, respectively.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Induced Stability of Nontrivial Topological Spin Textures: Unveiling Room&#8208;Temperature Hopfions and Skyrmions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first room&#8208;temperature, zero&#8208;field observation of stable skyrmion&#8211;hopfion spin textures in EuS&#9472;Bi2Se3&#9472;EuS trilayers is reported. Combining Lorentz TEM imaging and micromagnetic modeling, the authors unveil how interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and geometric confinement stabilize these multidimensional topological states. These findings offer a pathway toward ultralow&#8208;power spintronic devices harnessing robust, chiral magnetism in engineered topological heterostructures.








Abstract
Topological spin configurations, such as soliton&#8208;like spin texture and Dirac electron assemblies, have recently emerged in fundamental science and technology. Achieving stable topological spin textures at room temperature is crucial for their use as long&#8208;range information carriers. However, their creation and manipulation are hindered by multi&#8208;step field training and competing interactions. Thus, a spontaneous ground state for multidimensional topological spin textures is desirable, with skyrmions forming swirling, hedgehog&#8208;like spin structures in two dimensions and hopfions as their twisted 3D counterparts. Here, the first observation of robust and reproducible topological spin textures of hopfions and skyrmions observed at room temperature and in zero magnetic field is reported, which are stabilized by geometric confinement and protected by interfacial magnetism in a ferromagnet/topological insulator/ferromagnet trilayer heterostructure. These skyrmion&#8208;hopfion configurations are directly observed at room temperature with Lorenz transmission electron microscopy. Using micromagnetic modeling, the experimental observations of hopfion&#8208;skyrmion assemblies are reproduced. This model reveals a complete picture of how spontaneously organized skyrmion lattices encircled by hopfion rings are controlled by surface electrons, uniaxial anisotropy, and Dzyaloshinskii&#8208;Moriya interaction. This study provides evidence that topological chiral spin textures can facilitate the development of magnetic topological carriers, paving the way for ultralow&#8208;power and high&#8208;density information processing.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Imaging&#8208;Guided Self&#8208;Penetrating Nanomotors for Millimeter&#8208;Scale Deep Thrombolysis Tracking and Accelerated Embolus Clearance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The self&#8208;propulsive nanomotors enable NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided microemboli diagnosis and real&#8208;time thrombolysis monitoring at millimeter&#8208;scale resolution. Based on the active penetration&#8208;promoted thermoablation and chemical lysis, these nanomotors achieve efficient, rapid, safe thrombolysis in both posterior auricular artery thrombosis and submillimeter&#8208;sized microemboli&#8208;induced pulmonary embolism models.








Abstract
Pulmonary embolism (PE), a life&#8208;threatening condition caused by thromboembolic obstruction of pulmonary arteries, demands urgent therapeutic interventions and precise diagnostic strategies to prevent systemic complications. Current thrombolytic therapies and imaging modalities face critical limitations, including hemorrhagic risks from high&#8208;dose fibrinolytic drugs and insufficient sensitivity for detecting microemboli or dynamically tracking thrombolytic progression. Herein, a self&#8208;propelling nanomotor platform is reported that integrates second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided navigation, thrombus&#8208;targeting capability, and synergistic thrombolysis for real&#8208;time theranostics management of PE. Leveraging a relatively high fluorescence quantum yield (1.08%) for NIR&#8208;II probes and prolonged circulation half&#8208;life (7.2 h), these nanomotors enable sensitive detection of submillimeter microemboli and sustained, millimeter&#8208;level precision monitoring of thrombolytic progression. Through a self&#8208;penetration&#8208;enhanced synergistic therapy&#8208; combining thermal ablation and chemical lysis, the platform achieved rapid vascular recanalization, exceeding 95% efficiency within a shortened therapeutic timeframe, using only 13.6% of the clinical urokinase (UK) dose. Validation in both the posterior auricular artery thrombosis (PAAT) and submillimeter microemboli&#8208;induced PE models demonstrated accelerated embolus clearance, precision thrombolytic monitoring, and excellent biosafety without secondary embolism or hemorrhagic complications. This work demonstrates the significant potential of multifunctional nanomotors for the precision management of thrombotic disorders.

         <title>Bifunctionally Driven Organic Photonic Conversion Devices Facilitated by Minimalistic Synthesis&#8208;Based Interfacial Energetic Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid self&#8208;assembled monolayer (BPA) simultaneously optimizes hole extraction and noise suppression, enabling bifunctional organic photovoltaics&#8211;photodetectors that deliver superb indoor performance and commercial viability. BPA&#8208;devices achieve 28.6% PCE at 1000 lx, retain 93% efficiency on large&#8208;scaled devices, and reach 584 fW NEP with a 103 kHz 3dB bandwidth, while cutting production costs by 720%.








Abstract
Bifunctional integration of indoor organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and photodetectors (OPDs) faces fundamental challenges because of incompatible interfacial thermodynamics: indoor OPVs require unimpeded charge extraction under low&#8208;light conditions (200&#8211;1000&#160;lx), whereas OPDs require stringent suppression of noise current. Conventional hole transport layers (HTLs) fail to satisfy these opposing charge&#8208;dynamic requirements concurrently with commercial practicality (large&#8208;area uniformity, photostability, and cost&#8208;effective manufacturability). This study introduces benzene&#8208;phosphonic acid (BPA)&#8212;a minimalist self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM)&#8208;based HTL with a benzene core and phosphonic acid anchoring group&#8212;enabling cost&#8208;effective synthesis and excellent ITO interfacial properties such as energy alignment, uniform monolayer, and stability. This molecular design resolves core limitations and achieves high indoor OPV efficiency (28.6% PCE at 1000&#160;lx LED 2700 K), maintains 93% PCE retention when scaled by &#8776;220&#215; area, and delivers competitive self&#8208;powered (V = 0&#160;V) OPD performance (noise equivalent power = 584 fW at bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz and wavelength = 730&#160;nm; 3&#160;dB frequency = 103&#160;kHz). Simplified synthesis of BPA reduces production costs by 720% ($0.042 cm&#8722;2) and achieves 9&#215; higher power&#8208;per&#8208;cost ratio (19.25 mW&#8729;$&#8722;1) relative to its&#160;counterpart SAM. Synergy between performance and commercial practicality positions BPA&#8208;HTL as a transformative enabler for self&#8208;powered IoT and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Pyroelectric Enhanced Catalytic Oxidation: A Universal Strategy for Low&#8208;Temperature Gas Phase Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role in promoting heterogeneous catalytic reaction processes, but how to generate ROS continuously during the catalyst process remains a challenge. Here, the authors propose a pyroelectric&#8208;enhanced catalytic oxidation strategy to achieve efficient and continuous formation of ROS.








Abstract
In the field of gas phase catalysis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a crucial role, but how to improve catalytic efficiency and lifetime by forming ROS efficiently and sustainably during the catalytic process is a challenge for high&#8208;performance catalysts. Here, a pyroelectric enhanced catalytic oxidation (PECO) strategy is reported that can effectively enhance the catalytic oxidation efficiency and life of the catalyst by constantly generation of ROS. When gaseous pollutants of formaldehyde (HCHO) are catalytically degraded by conductive aerogel catalysts of MnOx, the HCHO to CO2 conversion efficiency is increased by &#8776;300% to 95.33% at a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV: 600 L&#160;gcat.&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) using the pyroelectric effect of BaTiO3, and the efficiency attenuation is less than 3% during the continuous catalytic process of 1200&#160;h. The experimental and theoretical analysis confirm that the pyroelectric effect contributes to improving valence transition of Mn3+/Mn4+ and electron transfer of oxygen&#8208;containing molecules thus leading to the continuous formation of ROS. The PECO strategy provides a simple and effective approach for ROS engineering and has broad application prospects in the field of catalysis.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Engineered Protein Delivery via Integrated Covalent Coupling and Pathological Triggers for Precision Microenvironment Reprogramming in Tissue Injury Repair</title>

         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;responsive biomaterial platform is developed for spatiotemporally controlled factor delivery in response to phase&#8208;specific enzymes (MMP2/thrombin). Using natural biomaterials (HA, SCECM, chitosan) and enzymatic conjugation (Sortase A), the system precisely delivers each protein in spinal cord and myocardial infarction models, this sequential release strategy significantly enhances tissue repair by optimizing the therapeutic window.








Abstract
Tissue injury presents a complex microenvironment with temporal pathological dynamics, necessitating precision therapeutic strategies. However, current interventions lack effective measures that precisely respond to and modulate the dynamic changes in the microenvironment. Herein, a biomaterial&#8208;driven platform based on covalent conjugation and enzyme&#8208;responsive release, enabling the spatiotemporally controlled delivery of regenerative and immunomodulatory factors, is developed. Following tissue injury, the early&#8208;phase protease thrombin and the delayed&#8208;phase matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;2 (MMP2) serve as endogenous triggers that correspond to distinct stages of the microenvironmental evolution. By site&#8208;specific covalent conjugation via Sortase A (SrtA)&#8208;mediated transpeptidation to intraluminal aligned fibers, combined with outer encapsulation within T&#8208;HA (thrombin&#8208;responsive cleavable hyaluronic acid gel), it is discovered that sequential delivery (CNTF/FGF2 followed by IL&#8208;4) significantly enhances spinal cord injury (SCI) recovery compared to reverse sequencing (IL&#8208;4 followed by CNTF/FGF2). Likewise, SrtA&#8208;mediated protein conjugation to HA demonstrates that FGF2 delivery preceding IL&#8208;4 resulted in superior cardiac functional restoration in the myocardial infarction (MI) model. This spatiotemporally system optimizes the critical therapeutic window for inflammation and tissue remodeling after injury, offering a versatile paradigm for addressing the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of injured tissues.

         <title>Breaking Efficiency Barrier: Dual&#8208;Channel Energy Transfer Enables Record 1540&#160; nm NIR LEDs from Er3+&#8208;Doped Cs3DyI6 Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cs3DyI6:Er3+ perovskite achieves strong 1540 nm emission via synergistic dual energy transfer pathways (STE &#8594; Er3+ and Dy3+ &#8594; Er3+), enhanced by phonon&#8208;assisted processes. This mechanism enables high&#8208;performance NIR LEDs with record EQE and stability, promising for optical communication applications.








Abstract
Er3+&#8208;doped 1.54 &#181;m light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) operating in the optical communication C&#8208;band are central to the development of integrated photonic systems. Given the pressing need for efficient, stable, cost&#8208;effective, and low&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven 1.54 &#181;m light sources, a lanthanide&#8208;based metal halide Cs3DyI6:Er3+ nanocrystal is engineered with a tetragonal phase structure. The study reveals a unique dual&#8208;channel energy transfer mechanism. The 574 nm emission, stemming from 4F9/2&#8208;2H13/2 orbital transitions of Dy3+ ions, enables phonon&#8208;assistant energy transfer to excite 4I15/2&#8208; 4S3/2 of Er3+ ions. Meanwhile, self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) contribute additional energy via a 488 nm broadband emission to excite 4I15/2&#8208;4F7/2 of Er3+. The two pathways synergize to facilitate efficient 1.54 &#181;m emission from Er3+ ions, overcoming limitations of traditional single&#8208;path energy transfer systems. To optimize device performance, 2,4,6&#8208;triphenyl&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;trioxane (TPPO) is employed for passivating surface defects to enhance the overall photoluminescence quantum yield up to 87.4%. Precise control of the LiF interlayer thickness (1&#8211;2 nm) achieves balanced electron&#8211;hole injection, significantly improving both external quantum efficiency (EQE) and operational stability. The fabricated infrared LED device demonstrates outstanding performance, with a record EQE of 2.76% at 1.54 &#181;m and a half&#8208;life of 345 min, marking a significant milestone in optical communication technology.

This work presents an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; polymer electrode&#8208;electrolyte material that integrates ion&#8208;conducting pathways and redox&#8208;active centers via covalent bonding. The polymer not only exhibits appreciable Li&#8314; conductivity, but also delivers a high reversible capacity below 2.5 V, driven by a potential&#8208;gated electronic structure transformation. This multifunctionality enables a versatile solid&#8208;state battery with integrated design, flexibility, and high energy density.








Abstract
The development of practical solid&#8208;state batteries is hindered by their high interfacial resistance and sluggish diffusion properties, primarily due to the heterogeneous interfaces between the solid electrolyte and the electrode. Here, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one polymer electrode&#8208;electrolyte material (P(EO2&#8208;S3)) is presented, which covalently integrates ethylene oxide groups for Li+ transport and trisulfide linkages for redox&#8208;active sites. This material exhibits favorable ionic conductivity as a solid electrolyte, while its reversible redox activity activates below 2.5&#160;V versus Li&#8314;/Li, delivering a high reversible capacity of 491.7 mAh g&#8722;1. Leveraging P(EO2&#8208;S3) as both cathode and electrolyte, integrated cells (P(EO2&#8208;S3)@CP|P(EO2&#8208;S3)|Li) exhibit accelerated electrochemical kinetics while maintaining cycling stability in flexible devices over 20&#160;000 bending cycles. As a redox&#8208;active catholyte of LiFePO4, P(EO2&#8208;S3) increases the capacity of the composite cathode to 358.3 mAh g&#8722;1 based on LiFePO4 mass, achieving an electrode energy density of 585.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work establishes a new paradigm for multifunctional polymers that integrates ion transport and storage, offering a versatile platform for flexible, high&#8208;energy solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Adaptive Localized Ectopic Structure Enhances Regeneration of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural repair is crucial for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes. A lithium&#8208;rich, low&#8208;cobalt deep eutectic solvent repairs phase defects, induces ectopic sites, and facilitates adaptive reconstruction during annealing. This process generates adaptive localized ectopic structures, which form degradation barriers that control long&#8208;range disorder through the regulation of localized disorder.








Abstract
Direct regeneration has emerged as a budding strategy for recycling spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries, yet restoring the degraded crystal structure of the cathode remains a momentous handicap. Here, a novel deep eutectic solvent rich in lithium (Li) is developed that not only induces the formation of an adaptive local ectopic structure (ALES) characterized by disordered and localized cations, but also facilitates the separation of cathode sheets and replenishes depleted elements. Within ALES, ectopic cobalt (Co) sites boost Li+ diffusion by expanding the Li slab and forming octahedral coordination with low&#8208;spin Co3+, while ectopic Li modulates Co&#9472;O interactions, collaboratively impeding long&#8208;range structural disorder, mitigating lattice stress, and reducing charge density fluctuations. The synergistic interaction between the ectopic Co and Li enables in situ structural repair of spent lithium cobalt oxide (LCO), thereby restoring crystallinity and enhancing electrochemical performance. The regenerated LCO delivers a reversible capacity of 183.08 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C, with 87.01% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, outperforming commercial counterparts. This study offers a new pathway for addressing an urgent bottleneck in structure&#8208;targeted LIB regeneration.

         <title>Constructing 0D Bismuth&#8208;Metal Nanosphere Networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 Heteromorphic Junctions for Efficient Photocatalytic Degradation of Acetaldehyde</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of Eucalyptus trees, a selective reduction strategy is proposed to grow bismuth nanosphere networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 (BWO) heteromorphic junctions, which consist of interwoven mesoporous nanofibers and nanosheets. The 0D/1D/2D Bi&#8208;BWO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde and exhibits superior stability over five cycles. Its degradation rate significantly surpasses traditional BWO.








Abstract
Semiconductor photocatalysis holds great potential for the degradation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), yet photocatalysts often experience low efficiency due to insufficient surface catalytic active sites, limited light absorption, and poor carrier separation efficiency. Inspired by the structure of Eucalyptus trees, a selective reduction strategy is proposed to grow bismuth nanosphere networks on 1D/2D Bi2WO6 (BWO) heteromorphic junctions, which consist of interwoven mesoporous nanofibers (NFs) and nanosheets (NSs). This establishes a synergistic mechanism of &#8220;surface active sites&#8208;intrinsic defects&#8208;carrier separation.&#8221; Initially, the electrospun BWO precursor NFs are calcined in air, resulting in 2D NSs growing radially along the NFs in an ordered, spaced arrangement to form 1D/2D BWO structures. Subsequently, under H2/Ar reduction, Bi3+ species are preferentially reduced to Bi&#8304; along the NF axes and NS corners, forming a dynamically evolved metal&#8208;defect regulatory system. The 0D/1D/2D Bi&#8208;BWO photocatalyst can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde and exhibits superior stability over five cycles. Its degradation rate is 3.5 times faster than that of 1D/2D BWO and significantly surpasses traditional BWO. This work presents a novel perspective for designing photocatalysts to efficiently remove VOCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Defect Passivation and Free&#8208;Volume Reduction by Fluorinated Hole Transport Materials for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
To enable simultaneous multi&#8208;defect passivation and interfacial free&#8208;volume reduction for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells, three hole&#8208;transport materials featuring distinct fluorine distribution are systematically designed and compared. Benefiting from better interfacial passivation ability, lower interfacial free&#8208;volume, more intimate interface contact, and enhanced suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation, AdF&#8208;BCz&#8208;based devices achieved a champion efficiency of 25.35% and excellent stability.








Abstract
Interfacial defects and free&#8208;volume between the perovskite layer and hole transport material (HTM) critically impact the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this work, the interfacial issues of the PSCs are addressed by strategically modulating the fluorine distribution in N,N&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole (BCz)&#8208;based HTMs, specifically, fluorine is introduced either asymmetrically and symmetrically on the peripheral groups, yielding AdF&#8208;BCz and SdF&#8208;BCz, respectively. Through a combination of experimental characterization and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, it is demonstrated that AdF&#8208;BCz exhibits superior interfacial passivation stability against Pb2+ and I&#8211; related defects, as well as stronger adhesion to the perovskite surface compared to the fluorine&#8208;free NF&#8208;BCz and symmetrically substituted SdF&#8208;BCz. Moreover, AdF&#8208;BCz reduces interfacial free&#8208;volume, promotes more intimate contact at the interface, and enhances the suppression of ion migration and perovskite degradation. Consequently, the PSCs fabricated with AdF&#8208;BCz achieved a notable efficiency of 25.35%, outperforming devices based on SdF&#8208;BCz (23.12%) and NF&#8208;BCz (24.2%). Furthermore, unencapsulated AdF&#8208;BCz based PSCs exhibit respectable stability, retaining 97% of their initial efficiencies after 2000&#160;h under 30% relative humidity and 82% after 300&#160;h of continuous heating at 85&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Semitransparent Photovoltaics via Reflection Optical Paths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work devises a reflective semitransparent photovoltaic (R&#8208;STPV) structure, which exploits a dual&#8208;surface reflection optical path to achieve equivalent transmission. By integrating a reflector that selectively reflects visible light, such a design enables a high&#8208;performance Si&#8208;based R&#8208;STPV with 14.4% efficiency and 92.2% visible light transmittance, setting a record light utilization efficiency of 13.28% among STPVs.








Abstract
Semitransparent photovoltaics (STPV) show great potential for building integration, but the imbalance between visible light transmission and power generation limits their practical applications. To overcome this, a reflective STPV (R&#8208;STPV) structure is proposed, via utilizing a dual&#8208;surface reflection optical path to achieve equivalent transmission. Unlike STPV systems relying on transmission optical paths, this design bypasses reflection losses and alleviates the stringent selective absorption requirements for the active layer. Thus, such design enables the fabrication of wavelength&#8208;selective STPVs using various high&#8208;performance photovoltaic materials such as silicon, CIGS, and CdTe. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an optical reflector is designed to selectively reflect visible light and transmit the invisible one, and by integrating it with the above PVs, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance R&#8208;STPV with appropriate optical geometry. Remarkably, the best Si&#8208;based R&#8208;STPV delivers a reliable efficiency of 14.4%, an average visible light transmittance of 92.2%, a record light utilization efficiency of 13.28% and an exceptional color rendering index of 99%. The versatility of R&#8208;STPV window technology makes it suitable for various building&#8208;integration application scenarios, and an average annual power generation of 69.8&#160;kWh&#160;year&#160;m&#8722;2 is obtained according to the simulation results. Therefore, this work paves a new path for high&#8208;performance solar windows that will contribute significantly to energy sustainability.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Insights into Nanoparticle Exsolution at Dislocations in Dislocation&#8208;Engineered Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals an atomic&#8208;level correlation between bulk dislocations and the exsolution of surface nanoparticles through a novel approach for dislocation engineering in epitaxial thin films. Employing in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, two primary reasons for the frequent nucleation of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles are identified: the accumulation of exsolution&#8208;active acceptors along dislocations and lattice distortions induced by the dislocation structure.








Abstract
Achieving control over properties such as density and lateral distribution of catalytic nanoparticles under operation conditions is a major challenge for the development of active and durable catalysts, where nanoparticle coarsening is often the cause of performance degradation. While metal exsolution catalysts are regarded to be robust against this degradation mode, coarsening and increased concentrations of exsolved metal nanoparticles have been detected near extended defects. The present study examines the role of dislocations in metal exsolution reactions and explores the potential of dislocation&#8208;engineering for the synthesis of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles. An atomic&#8208;level correlation between bulk dislocations and surface nanoparticle locations is demonstrated through a novel approach for engineering epitaxial thin films with confined regions of increased dislocation densities in combination with in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. While nanoparticle exsolution proceeds across the entire sample, two primary reasons for the frequent nucleation of dislocation&#8208;associated nanoparticles are identified: the accumulation of exsolution&#8208;active acceptors along dislocations and lattice distortions that are likely to lower the energy barrier for nanoparticle nucleation. This work establishes a proof of concept for using engineered dislocations in exsolution catalysts to synthesize nanoparticles with modified nanoparticle&#8208;support properties relevant for the thermal stability and the lateral distribution of exsolved nanoparticles.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Strain Responsive Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescence for Potential Nondestructive Artificial Joint Stress Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ and real&#8208;time stress sensing during total knee replacement procedure is expected to be realized based on near&#8208;infrared mechanoluminescent phosphor of Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99, which has the lowest strain sensitivity as low as 50&#160;&#181;st. 








Abstract
Recently, joint replacement surgery is facing significant challenges of patient dissatisfaction and the need for revision procedures. In&#8208;situ monitoring of stress stability at the site of artificial joint replacement during postoperative evaluation is important. Mechanoluminescence (ML), a novel &#8220;force to light&#8221; conversion technology, may be used to monitor such bio&#8208;stress within tissues. However, this is hindered by ultraviolet&#8211;visible ML emission wavelength, low ML intensity, and high strain response sensitivity. Here, by incorporating Sb3+ ions into Sr3Sn2O7 crystals, a highly strain&#8208;responsive&#160;material, with ML originating from intrinsic defect emissions is obtained. The Sr3Sn1.98Sb0.02O6.99 film produces detectable ML signals under compressive strain as low as 50&#160;&#181;st in the absence of biological tissue. After pre&#8208;irradiating with red light through 15&#160;mm of porcine tissue, ML signals can still be detected through the same tissue thickness. Notably, this material enabled real&#8208;time stress imaging through 4&#160;mm of porcine skin during mild finger joint bending. This work presents a novel methodological framework and proposes a new mechanism to defect ML. It offers a fresh perspective for designing high&#8208;performance ML materials and lays the foundation for innovative research to enhance the functionality of artificial tissues and joints in living organism.

         <title>Temporally Reconfigurable Reservoir Computing with Flexible Electrolyte&#8208;Gated TFTs for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temporally reconfigurable reservoir computing system is developed using ultrathin, flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;gated thin&#8208;film transistors (UFLEX TFTs). By simply tuning temporal dynamics electrically, the system achieves 93.7% accuracy for MNIST handwritten digits, 90.3% for CIFAR&#8208;10 images, and 81.8% for chest X&#8208;rays, surpassing CNNs in efficiency. Combining strong performance and flexibility, UFLEX TFTs enable neuromorphic hardware for next&#8208;generation wearable edge devices.








Abstract
Reservoir computing (RC), a brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic algorithm, offers simplicity and efficiency for processing spatiotemporal signals. However, conventional RC systems face limitations in handling diverse temporal scales and spatial complexities due to invariant temporal dynamics. This study introduces a temporally reconfigurable RC system utilizing ultrathin, flexible, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;gated thin&#8208;film transistors (UFLEX TFTs) with high performance: an on/off ratio of &#8776;107, endurance beyond 2.5 &#215; 104 pulses, and low variability. UFLEX TFTs, based on molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) channels and organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid AlOx dielectrics, enable modulation of temporal dynamics via simple electrical signals. The system maintains mechanical flexibility and robust performance after bending tests. By extracting features across varied temporal and spatial scales, it achieves classification accuracies of 90.3% for CIFAR&#8208;10 object images and 81.8% for NIH chest X&#8208;ray images. This work lays a foundation for flexible neuromorphic hardware systems capable of efficient, high&#8208;performance spatiotemporal signal processing.

         <title>A Readily Synthesized All&#8208;In&#8208;One Nanowire Hydrogel: Toward Inhibiting Tumor Recurrence and Postoperative Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled vanadium hydrogel integrates multienzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal THPS via one&#8208;step nanoconstruction. This TME&#8208;responsive platform combines catalytic tumor suppression, infection prevention, and dynamic mechanoadaptivity to surgical niches. By reprogramming immunosuppressive microenvironments via M1 macrophage polarization and cytotoxic T&#8208;cell recruitment, the hydrogel pioneers a paradigm for precision postsurgical therapy through synergistic immunomodulation and localized intervention.








Abstract
Surgical resection remains the frontline intervention for cancer; however, postoperative tumor recurrence and wound infection remain critical unmet challenge in surgical oncology. Herein, an all&#8208;in&#8208;one nanowired hydrogel (V&#8208;Hydrogel) is developed through a facile one&#8208;step assembly employing enzyme&#8208;mimetic V2O5 nanowires and bactericidal crosslinker THPS. The V&#8208;Hydrogel reserves the glutathione peroxidase&#8208;, peroxidase&#8208;, catalase&#8208;, and oxidase&#8208;mimetic enzymatic activities derived from vanadium oxide nanowires, thereby exhibiting efficient tumor&#8208;specific catalytic therapy. Simultaneously, the introduction of bactericide THPS endows the potent antibacterial capabilities of V&#8208;Hydrogel against surgical site infections. This hydrogel exhibits dynamic mechanical adaptability to the tumor microenvironment (f), ensuring conformal coverage of irregular resection cavities for precise therapy. Additionally, the V&#8208;Hydrogel can reprogram the immunosuppressive TME via polarizing macrophages into antitumor M1 phenotypes and recruiting cytotoxic T cells, thereby establishing systemic antitumor immunity. This multifunctional vanadium&#8208;integrated hydrogel platform, designed based on the pathological characteristics of postoperative tumors, addresses key limitations in conventional postoperative therapies, offering a strategy for postoperative adjuvant tumor therapy.

         <title>Regenerable Water Remediation Platform for Ultrafast Capture and Mineralization of Per&#8208; and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are effectively captured and mineralized by nitrate&#8208;intercalated copper&#8211;aluminum layered double hydroxides (CuAl LDH). The capture&#8211;thermal destruction&#8211;recycling process achieves ultrafast PFAS removal and regenerable water remediation. Regenerability is enabled by the memory effect of LDH, restoring the layered structure after thermal treatment and allowing repeated adsorption&#8208;destruction cycles with maintained performance.








Abstract
Concerns about per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) arise from their persistence, toxicity, and widespread presence in aquatic environments. Currently, activated carbon and ion exchange resins have been used to remove perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the most commonly studied PFAS, but these methods face challenges like low adsorption capacity and slow kinetics, leading to secondary waste issues. Here, it is observed that a high interlayer crystallinity of nitrate intercalated CuxAl layered double hydroxides (LDH) (CuxAl&#8208;NO3 LDH) enables a boundary&#8208;breaking performance of maximum adsorption capacity (qmax) of PFOA as 1702&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at neutral pH and room temperature. The Al&#8208;Al clash within the cationic layers (basal plane disorder) enhances adsorption kinetics (k1 = 13.2 h&#8722;1), as determined by a 2H magic angle spinning (MAS) solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy. Furthermore, PFOA&#8208;saturated Cu2Al&#8208;NO3 LDH can be regenerated through its memory effect, achieving &#8776;54% defluorination of the adsorbed PFOA in the presence of CaCO3 after the thermal treatment at 773 K (500&#160;&#176;C). Performance in continuous fixed&#8208;bed systems (720&#160;mg&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5 mL&#160;min&#8722;1) and PFOA&#8208;spiked real water matrices indicates the practical application potential of CuxAl&#8208;NO3 LDH, suggesting an effective integrated ultrafast capture&#8211;thermal destruction&#8211;recycling (CTR) process for treating PFAS&#8208;contaminated water.

         <title>Lanthanum&#8208;Induced Gradient Fields in Asymmetric Heterointerface Catalysts for Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>

Uncontrolled atomic migration during the pyrolysis of metal&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts often leads to disordered coordination environments, active site loss, and poor oxygen electrocatalytic activities. Herein, a La&#8208;mediated atomic migration strategy enables the fabrication of a well&#8208;defined asymmetric heterostructure (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC) featuring a built&#8208;in electric field. This architecture stabilizes the Fe active sites, enhances interfacial charge transport, and delivers an outstanding oxygen electrocatalysis performance.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) catalysts display considerable potential as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble metals in oxygen electrocatalysis. However, uncontrolled atomic migration and random structural rearrangement during pyrolysis often lead to disordered coordination environments and sparse active sites, fundamentally limiting their intrinsic catalytic activities and long&#8208;term durability. Herein, a novel strategy is reported for use in directionally regulating atomic migration pathways via the incorporation of a foreign metal (La). By exploiting the differences in the atomic migration priorities via the Kirkendall effect, directional control of atomic diffusion is achieved to fabricate a well&#8208;defined asymmetric multiphase heterointerface catalyst (LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC). The presence of high&#8208;density, structurally well&#8208;defined active sites &#8211; along with a built&#8208;in directional electric field across the heterointerface &#8211; substantially enhances the efficiency of interfacial charge transport, thus improving the intrinsic activity and stability in oxygen electrocatalysis. When incorporated into a rechargeable Zn&#8208;air battery, LaN/LaFe&#8208;NC delivers a high power density of 211 mW cm&#8722;2, with an exceptional cycling stability of &gt;240 h. This study establishes a generalizable atomic&#8208;level design strategy for use in engineering robust heterointerface catalysts and offers valuable insights for application in advancing next&#8208;generation renewable energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>High Performance Transmission&#8208;Type Daytime Radiative Cooling Film with a Simple and Scalable Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative, scalable method fabricates transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles by blending mid&#8208;infrared (mid&#8208;IR) transparent styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with polyethylene, then selectively dissolving SEBS to create pores. The textile achieves 95% solar reflectivity, 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance, and sub&#8208;ambient cooling of 4&#176;C. This process reduces production costs by 68% and CO2 emissions by 92% versus conventional methods.








Abstract
Transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling textiles represent a vital strategy for personal thermal management. However, traditional preparation methods based on heat&#8208;induced phase separation face significant challenges regarding cost, environmental impact, and optical performance. Herein, a novel preparation method is devloped by blending mid&#8208;IR transparent solid styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) with solid polyethylene (PE), enabling the creation of pores through dissolving SEBS. Consequently, large&#8208;scale production of transmission&#8208;type radiative cooling films at the meter scale are achieved, exhibiting 95% solar reflectivity and 80% mid&#8208;IR transmittance. Moreover, this method reduces costs by 68% and diminishes CO2 emissions by 92%. Under sunny and cloudy conditions (solar irradiance &#8776;730 and 280&#160;Wm&#8722;2, respectively), the film&#8208;covered simulated skin demonstrates sub&#8208;ambient cooling effects of &#8776;4 and 3&#160;&#176;C. Given its exceptional passive cooling capabilities, low&#8208;cost, and scalability, this film holds great potential for industrial and personal applications.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Degraded LiFePO4 Cathode Material via Natural Electron Donors Healing and Targeted Surface Reconstruction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated bulk and surface restoration strategy is proposed to regenerate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) via using natural tea polyphenols as electron donors to reduce Fe (III) phase and heal anti&#8208;site defects in the bulk, and introducing a hybrid AlPO4/Li3PO4 (AP/LP) patching coating at the fracture of carbon layer on LFP for targeted surface reconstruction, accompanied by Al doping into the bulk LFP.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent cathode materials is crucial for the sustainable development of the new energy vehicle industry. However, owing to the lack of targeted surface repair strategies, the regenerated LiFePO4 (LFP) always faces some issues, such as Fe ions re&#8208;migration and sluggish Li+ diffusion, or a serious trade&#8208;off between restored specific capacity and stability. Herein, an integrated bulk and surface restoration strategy is proposed to regenerate spent LFP (S&#8208;LFP) via using natural tea polyphenols as electron donors to reduce Fe (III) phase and heal anti&#8208;site defects in the bulk, and introducing a hybrid AlPO4/Li3PO4 (AP/LP) patching coating at the fracture of carbon layer on LFP for targeted surface reconstruction, accompanied by Al doping into the bulk LFP. Theoretical calculations reveal that AP/LP patching coating forms a dual electron&#8208; and ion&#8208;conducting layer with the residual carbon layer, coupling with strengthened Fe&#9472;O bonding by Al doping, to improve kinetics and stability of LFP during cycling. The optimized regenerated LFP cathode exhibits a capacity of 124.3 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles at 2C with a capacity retention of 92.1%. This scalable healing and stabilizing strategy have large potential to strike a balance between specific capacity repairing and stability improvement in the regeneration process.

         <title>Localized Gradient Conductivity Enabled Ultrasensitive Flexible Tactile Sensors with Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design of localized gradient conductivity is presented, combining low&#8208;&#963; CPDMS (carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane) and high&#8208;&#963; AgNWs (silver nanowires) to resolve the mutual restriction between sensitivity and linearity of piezoresistive tactile sensors. The derived series&#8208;parallel switching enables the ultrawide linear range (0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa) and ultrahigh sensitivity (1546.35 kPa&#8722;1). The work opens up promising strategies for future high&#8208;performance flexible tactile sensors toward diverse application scenarios.








Abstract
The high sensitivity and wide linearity are crucial for flexible tactile sensors in adapting to diverse application scenarios with high accuracy and reliability. However, conventional optimization strategies of constructing microstructures suffer from the mutual restriction between the high sensitivity and wide linearity. Herein, a novel design of localized gradient conductivity (LGC) with partly covered low&#8208;conductivity (low&#8208;&#963;) carbon/Polydimethylsiloxane layer on high&#8208;conductivity (high&#8208;&#963;) silver nanowires film upon the micro&#8208;dome structure is proposed. The LGC configuration enables a unique pressure&#8208;motivated series&#8208;parallel switching to allow the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components to separately take dominant effects in different pressure ranges. The ultrawide linearity can thus be realized by customizing the segmented linear current variation via the rationally associated coverage degree and conductivity gradient of the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components. Moreover, the ultrahigh sensitivity can be originally endowed by the conductivity difference between the low&#8208;&#963; and high&#8208;&#963; components without compromising linearity. The optimized sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 1546.35 kPa&#8722;1 within an ultrabroad linear sensing range of 0&#8211;3000&#160;kPa, which is first reported. With such an excellent sensing performance, the potential applications, e.g., reliable healthcare monitoring, convenient smart home control, and ground detection of intelligent vehicles, are successfully demonstrated.

A novel optically controlled KNbO3 memristor is developed. This device utilizes light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancies to regulate the formation of conductive filaments, enabling nonvolatile switching behavior. The memristor demonstrated a high switching ratio (&gt;102), endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, extended retention (&gt;104 s), and pronounced light/dark contrast. These characteristics significantly enhance the visual perception capabilities under complex lighting conditions. The implementation achieved 96% image recognition accuracy, demonstrating substantial progress in bioinspired vision chip technology.








Abstract

Neuromorphic Visual Devices hold considerable promise for integration into neuromorphic vision systems that combine sensing, memory, and computing. This potential arises from their synergistic benefits in optical signal detection and neuro&#8208;inspired computational processes. However, current devices face challenges such as insufficient light/dark resistance ratios, mismatched transient photo&#8208;response, and volatile retention characteristics, limiting their adaptability to complex artificial vision systems. Here, a novel optically controlled memristor is developed by leveraging the unique properties of KNbO3, where resistive switching originates from the dynamic reconstruction of conductive filaments controlled by light&#8208;modulated oxygen vacancy charges. Experimental results reveal exceptional reconfigurable electrical characteristics across the 405&#8211;650 nm visible spectrum: optically triggered nonvolatile resistive switching, dual&#8208;modal dark&#8208;state operation, switching ratio &gt;102, endurance 6 &#215; 106 cycles, retention &gt;104 s, photo&#8208;to&#8208;dark current ratio &gt;102, and self&#8208;powered capability. The enhanced light/dark resistance contrast significantly improves visual perception in complex illumination environments, whereas the synergistic interplay between the dynamic photo&#8208;response and nonvolatile storage balances transient signal processing with persistent information retention. In integrated sensing&#8208;memory&#8208;computing tasks, the devices achieved recognition accuracies of 96% and 85% on the standard Jellyfish dataset and its low&#8208;illumination variant, demonstrating technical feasibility and providing a theoretically grounded solution with practical implications for the development of bioinspired vision chips.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Tunable Heliconical and Ferroelectric Nematics for White Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of the ferroelectric nematic (NF) phase in 2017 and the spontaneous symmetry&#8208;breaking of the ferroelectric twist&#8208;bend nematic (NTBF)phase in 2024 have made major breakthroughs in the context of self&#8208;assembly materials. This study presents pioneering temperature and voltage&#8208;tunable lasing in both phases, demonstrating multicolor and in&#8208;demand white lasers. Additionally, spontaneously formed emissive fibers are shown, with promising applications for displays and Light Fidelity (Li&#8208;Fi) technologies.








Abstract
Nematic Liquid Crystals (LCs), noted for their simple molecular alignment and broad use in optoelectronics, remain unmodified for over a century. However, in 2017, a unique polar phase, the ferroelectric nematic (NF), is confirmed. Subsequently, in 2024, the revolutionary spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking of ferroelectric twist&#8208;bend nematic chiral structures (NTBF phase) is demonstrated. Nematic LCs are commonly used as optically active matrices for luminescent dyes, allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of emission properties through external fields. In this manuscript, the pioneering temperature&#8208;tunable lasing studies utilizing commercial dyes doped into a mixture that displays the NTBF phase within an exceptionally low&#8208;temperature range of 34&#8211;43.3&#160;&#176;C are shown. The subsequent experiments explore how lasing characteristics within NTBF and NF phases can be employed in a single, compact device to produce multicolor and white lasers. Furthermore, there are introduced spontaneously formed emissive fibers from the NTBF phase. As perspectives, the voltage&#8208;dependent increase of lasing intensity in NF is demonstrated, showing the exceptional result in two differently arranged LC cells. The findings highlight that simple molecules, like those in nature and living organisms, can shape intricate systems with significant implications for the accelerated progress of laser and display technologies, along with Li&#8208;Fi concepts.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of 1.84&#160;eV Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites Photovoltaics Beyond 19% via Yb3+ Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially those with a bandgap &#8776;1.84&#160;eV, are pivotal for tandem photovoltaics. However, severe halide phase segregation and ion migration critically limit their efficiency and operational stability. In this work, these challenges are addressed through an innovative Yb3&#8314;&#8208;based additive engineering strategy. Based on this strategy, the champion Yb(TFSI)3&#8208;modified PSCs achieved a PCE of 19.06%.








Abstract
Phase segregation remains one of the most critical challenges limiting the performance and long&#8208;term operational stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This issue is especially pronounced in 1.84&#160;eV wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites, where severe halide phase segregation leads to compositional heterogeneity and accelerated device degradation. In this work, a comprehensive investigation of halide ion distribution across the surface and bottom interfaces of 1.84&#160;eV perovskite films is conducted, revealing significant Br&#8722;/I&#8722; halide phase segregation that severely impairs device efficiency and stability. To address this, Ytterbium (III) trifluoromethanesulfonate (Yb(TFSI)3) is introduced as a multifunctional additive in the perovskite precursor. The strong coordination between Yb3+ ions and halide anions not only modulates the crystallization kinetics but also homogenizes the spatial distribution of Br&#8208;rich and I&#8208;rich domains, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced compositional heterogeneity. Furthermore, Yb3+ significantly suppresses halide migration and ion exchange processes, thereby enhancing phase stability. Depth&#8208;resolved characterizations, including grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, confirm improved crystallinity, structural uniformity, and suppressed phase segregation across the film depth. As a result, the champion device achieves an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.06% and retains 85% of its initial efficiency after 1500&#160;h in a nitrogen atmosphere (10% RH, 25&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Mechanoluminescent Aluminum Nitride Crystal for Super&#8208;Sensitive Optical Manometry, Thermometry and Force Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the first discovery of intrinsic mechanoluminescence in undoped AlN crystals, accompanied by pronounced photoluminescence and persistent luminescence. It further demonstrates a defect&#8208;emission&#8211;driven multifunctional optical sensing platform for force, pressure, and temperature detection, achieving exceptional sensitivities.








Abstract
AlN is a core material widely used as a substrate and heat sink in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Introducing luminescent properties into intrinsic AIN opens new opportunities for next&#8208;generation intelligent sensors, self&#8208;powered displays, and wearable electronics. In this study, the first evidence is presented of AlN crystals exhibiting satisfactory mechanoluminescence (ML), photoluminescence (PL), and afterglow performance, demonstrating their potential as novel multifunctional optical sensors. A series of undoped AlN crystals (ranging from &#181;m to mm scale) is successfully synthesized on tungsten substrates via physical vapor transport. A multimodal optical sensing platform is developed, showing afterglow and PL for temperature and pressure sensing, and ML for force detection. Despite minimal structural deformation under extreme conditions, attributed to the high bulk modulus of AIN, the optical sensors, driven by intrinsic defect&#8208;related emissions, exhibited excellent sensitivity to temperature and pressure. Notably, significant and previously unreported differences in the PL and ML spectra are observed in response to light and mechanical stimuli, respectively. These spectral variations are attributed to the activation of distinct defect states during PL and ML processes. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study represents a significant step forward in the development of optical sensing technologies for extreme environments and force detection applications.

Abstract
Emerging contaminants, including pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), pose significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. This study demonstrates efficient electrochemical oxidation of PPCPs using a novel tin&#8208;antimony doped carbon nanofiber membrane (Sn&#8208;Sb&#8208;CNF) anode leveraging dual&#8208;metal synergy. Oxygen vacancies generated through this synergistic effect function as active sites, enhancing pollutant adsorption capacity and oxidant activation capability. The degradation mechanism proceeds primarily via dominant hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation, leading to complete contaminant mineralization. Notably, Sn/Sb dual&#8208;metal doping modulates the electronic structure, altering the d&#8208;band center from &#8722;4.777 to &#8722;2.175 eV and significantly lowering reaction energy barriers. This electronic optimization facilitates electron transfer kinetics and accelerates pollutant degradation. Owing to this synergy, the Sn&#8208;Sb&#8208;CNF anode achieved high removal efficiencies (&gt;90%) within 30 min for multiple PPCPs: ofloxacin (95%), enrofloxacin (91%), carbamazepine (90%), acetaminophen (82%), and ibuprofen (96%). Furthermore, the membrane exhibits potent antimicrobial activity, achieving 4&#8208;log inactivation of tetracycline&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and 5&#8208;log reduction of T7 bacteriophage within 30 min. In real wastewater containing antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria from a treatment plant, the system attained 62% mineralization rate. This work establishes a dual&#8208;metal synergy strategy that provides new avenues for efficient PPCP elimination in complex aqueous matrices.

         <title>Intensifying D&#8208;Orbitals Energy Level Splitting of Local Co Atoms in CoO Lattice for Accelerated Iodine Redox Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduced oxygen vacancies in CoO lattice induce low&#8208;to&#8208;high spin state transition at adjacent Co active sites, which optimizes spin&#8208;orbital coupling with I2/I&#8210; molecular orbitals to enable faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions on cathode, thus achieving enhanced energy efficiency of the assembled Zn&#8208;I2 batteries.









Abstract
Modulating the electronic structure of catalysts to maximize their power holds the key to address the challenges faced by zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs), including the shuttle effect and slow redox kinetics at the iodine cathode. Herein, oxygen vacancies is innovatively introduced into CoO lattice to create high&#8208;spin&#8208;state Co active sites in nonstoichiometric CoO1&#8331;x nanocrystals supported by carbon nanofibers (H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs). This simple strategy intensifies crystal field splitting of Co 3d orbitals, optimizing the spin&#8208;orbital coupling between Co 3d orbitals and iodine species. The resulting enhanced availability of more unpaired electrons in non&#8208;degenerate eg orbitals facilitates faster electron donation/acceptance during iodine redox reactions, thus improved reaction kinetics. Therefore, the assembled ZIBs employing H&#8208;CoO1&#8331;x/CNFs/I2 cathode acquires a narrower overpotential gap (37 mV), higher initial capacity (203.0 mAh g&#8210;1), and better cycling stability (96.0% capacity retention after 2200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8210;1) compared to the CoO/CNFs/I2 cathode without experiencing defect engineering (109 mV/192.6 mAh g&#8210;1/74.7% after 1000 cycles). This work opens new avenues for maximizing the potential power of cathode host catalysts, making immediate contributions to the advancement of aqueous halogen batteries.

         <title>Direct Writing of Oxygen&#8208;Doped Mo2C Enabled by Low&#8208;Temperature Laser Deposition for High&#8208;Performance Acidic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molybdenum carbide electrocatalysts exhibit limited hydrogen evolution performance due to excessively strong Mo&#8208;H interactions. Low&#8208;temperature laser deposition enables the kinetic stabilization of metastable oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C with optimized electronic structure, delivering high activity and long&#8208;term durability for acidic hydrogen production at industrial current densities.








Abstract
Molybdenum carbides have gained tremendous attention for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to their high electrical conductivity and similar d&#8208;band structure to platinum. Among molybdenum carbides, Mo2C catalysts have exhibited greater potential for acidic HER. However, their performance is restricted by the strong binding interaction between molybdenum and hydrogen. Herein, a series of Mo2C catalysts are synthesized using a rapid, low&#8208;temperature laser deposition method to dope oxygen atoms into the Mo2C lattices. The metastable oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C exhibits a low overpotential of 125 mV at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, showing significant improvement compared to Mo2C (&#8776;182 mV). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the introduction of oxygen into the lattices of Mo2C can reduce the hydrogen adsorption free energy, indicating that hydrogen production is more favorable on oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst. At the industrial&#8208;level current density of 1 A&#160;cm&#8722;2, the oxygen&#8208;doped Mo2C electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional performance with a low overpotential of 312 mV. Moreover, it exhibits remarkable stability, maintaining consistent hydrogen production for 200 h (&gt;8 days) in 0.5 M H2SO4, potentially&#160;outperforming most non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts. This work highlights a new method to synthesize high&#8208;performance transition metal carbide catalysts with a tunable electronic structure to enhance HER performance.

Abstract
The development of novel methods to enhance enzyme&#8208;carrier interactions in situ, at a feasible cost, and on a large scale is crucial for improving the stability and durability of current immobilized enzyme systems used in industrial settings. Here, a pioneering approach termed &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; is proposed, which utilizes protein&#8208;catalyzed silicification to fix enzyme within porous matrix while preserving enzyme activity. This innovative strategy offers several key benefits, including conformational stabilization of enzymes, improved interactions between enzymes and the matrix, prevention of enzyme leakage, and mitigation of pore blocking. Moreover, the controllable and scalable nature of this method renders it a cost&#8208;effective solution for enhancing enzyme immobilization in industrial contexts. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the &#8220;silica&#8208;based inorganic glue&#8221; technology, it has applied to three different enzymes exhibiting varying surface characteristics, sizes, and functions and in diverse porous supports, including a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) and a commercial macroporous resin, which resulted in a significant improvement of the stability and longevity of the immobilized enzymes. Overall, this findings represent a significant advancement in enzyme immobilization techniques, signaling a paradigm shift in current industrial catalysis.

         <title>Critical Role of Ultra&#8208;Microporous Tunnel Structure Within Hard Carbon in Boosting Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>

The desolvation and weak capillary effect of UMTS can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte and thus significantly enhance the ICE, which also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, effectively enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity.








Abstract
Accurately constructing pore structures and clarifying the relationship between pore structure and sodium storage performance to obtain high&#8208;quality hard carbon (HC) is crucial for the commercialization of sodium&#8208;ion batteries. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously obtain HC with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), excellent rate performance, and satisfactory capacity in ester electrolytes by modifying the pore structure. Herein, the challenge is innovatively addressed by optimizing the dechlorination polymerization reaction to obtain the precursor, thereby modulating the carbon atom structure rearrangement and preoxidation process to design the HC with ultra&#8208;microporous tunnel structure (UMTS). The desolvation of UMTS (&lt;1&#160;nm) and the weak capillary effect at the surface can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte at the electrode surface and thus significantly enhance the ICE. The UMTS also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, greatly enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity.

This design concept of precisely constructing UMTS contributes significantly to the rational design of high&#8208;quality HC anode, and may be extended to other battery systems to promote the ongoing advancement of battery technology.

&lt;p&gt;The desolvation and weak capillary effect of UMTS can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte and thus significantly enhance the ICE, which also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, effectively enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately constructing pore structures and clarifying the relationship between pore structure and sodium storage performance to obtain high-quality hard carbon (HC) is crucial for the commercialization of sodium-ion batteries. However, it is still challenging to simultaneously obtain HC with high initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE), excellent rate performance, and satisfactory capacity in ester electrolytes by modifying the pore structure. Herein, the challenge is innovatively addressed by optimizing the dechlorination polymerization reaction to obtain the precursor, thereby modulating the carbon atom structure rearrangement and preoxidation process to design the HC with ultra-microporous tunnel structure (UMTS). The desolvation of UMTS (&amp;lt;1&#160;nm) and the weak capillary effect at the surface can effectively reduce the decomposition of the electrolyte at the electrode surface and thus significantly enhance the ICE. The UMTS also facilitates the rapid transport of sodium ions and provides sites for the storage of sodium clusters, greatly enhancing the rate performance and reversible capacity. As a result, especially in ester electrolyte, the optimized material demonstrates an ultrahigh ICE of 90.9%, good rate performance (108.7 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and an outstanding reversible capacity (357.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with 98.3% of the capacity contribution below 1&#160;V). This design concept of precisely constructing UMTS contributes significantly to the rational design of high-quality HC anode, and may be extended to other battery systems to promote the ongoing advancement of battery technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Non&#8208;PFAS&#8208;Based Magnetic Polymer Sorbents for Efficient Removal of Perfluorinated Compounds from Landfill Leachate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic polymer sorbents featuring non&#8208;per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (non&#8208;PFAS)&#8208;based fluorinated and cationic groups enable selective and efficient removal of multiple PFAS from complex landfill leachate. By optimizing functional group balance and polymer design, the sorbents achieve &gt;90% removal, excellent reusability, and outperform commercial materials&#8212;offering a promising solution for PFAS remediation in challenging real&#8208;world water matrices.








Abstract
Per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are carcinogenic and environmentally persistent contaminants, necessitating their efficient removal to protect environmental and human health. In this study, a series of fluorinated, non&#8208;PFAS&#8208;based magnetic polymer sorbents is developed for the selective removal of multiple PFAS from landfill leachate containing high levels of co&#8208;contaminants. Crosslinked polymer networks are shown to enhance both magnetic separation and PFAS sorption performance. The magnetic sorbent with a higher proportion of quaternary ammonium groups and a lower proportion of fluorinated segments shows improved sorption kinetics for most PFAS and greater sorption capacity for perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS), the most abundant compound in the tested landfill leachate. However, this formulation exhibits lower sorption selectivity and reduced equilibrium removal efficiencies when PFAS are present at low initial concentrations. A compact and portable treatment device is constructed to simulate practical deployment. The system achieves high PFAS removal efficiencies (&gt;90% for the majority of PFAS) and maintains good regeneration and reusability over five sorption&#8208;desorption cycles at environmentally relevant concentrations. Compared to four commercially available sorbents, the developed magnetic polymer sorbents exhibit superior performance in PFAS removal, indicating their potential as efficient candidates for remediating PFAS from landfill leachate.

         <title>Achieving Electrode Smoothing by Controlling the Nucleation Phase of Metal Deposition Through Polymer&#8208;Substrate Binding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals how polyethylene oxide (PEO) facilitates smooth electrode deposition using in situ experiments and simulations. PEO does not bind to Zn or Zn2+ to control growth but adsorbs on Cu, tuning Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfacial energy. This promotes the nucleation of flat&#8208;lying Zn (002) platelets and confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow region near the interface.








Abstract
Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and many other battery systems. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, the knowledge gap is addressed by using in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on Cu substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions, which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, the results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)&#8208;oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near&#8208;surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.

         <title>Revisiting Ferroelectric&#8208;Gated Phototransistors: A Tripartite Synapse&#8208;Inspired Approach to In&#8208;Sensor Image Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) enables linear and multilevel modulation of photoconductance through partial polarization switching and photogating effects. The device achieves photonic non&#8208;volatility over a 153&#160;dB dynamic range and performs in&#8208;sensor processing under unstructured illumination, demonstrating enhanced face recognition accuracy by recalibrating distorted visual inputs into a pre&#8208;trained range.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices inspired by the tripartite synapse system offer enhanced modulation of synaptic weight via a third terminal. However, using an electrically independent terminal for memorizing and processing optical information remains unexplored. Here, a ferroelectric&#8208;gated phototransistor (FGPT) incorporating ferroelectric polymers and organic photoactive channels is revisited for neuromorphic vision systems. It is demonstrated that partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric gate insulator enables linear control of the photoactive channel. Furthermore, the photogating effect induced by charge trapping at the ferroelectric insulator/photoactive channel interface further enhances the photonic non&#8208;volatile (PNV) characteristics of the FGPT. This allows memorized visual information, expressed as photoconductance, to be incrementally potentiated or depressed. The modulated photoconductance fully spans the current level within the dynamic range of the device (153&#160;dB). Finally, the feasibility of the device for all&#8208;day face recognition is shown by in&#8208;sensor processing of visual information obtained from unstructured environments into the pre&#8208;trained range. This approach results in up to a &#8776;40% improvement in recognition accuracy.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Delivery of Required Facilitators for Microenvironment Remodeling Propels Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid conduit integrates electrospun nanofibers with bioactive hydrogels for spatiotemporal delivery of multiple bioactive factors, precisely targeting critical pathological cascades after SCI. Initially, CAT release reduces oxidative stress and inflammation, while subsequent EGF delivery provides a supportive substrate for axon growth. Combined with NT3 and GDNF, it enhances axon regeneration and synaptic plasticity, ultimately improving motor and bladder function.








Abstract
Intricate pathological responses and multiple components within the lesion make it challenging to repair spinal cord injury (SCI). A multifunctional hybrid neural restorative conduit is developed, composed of a sandwich&#8208;like hydrogel encapsulated within a polycaprolactone (PCL) nanofiber membrane. The sandwich structure consists of a hyaluronic acid&#8208;graft&#8208;dopamine (HADA)/HGF&#8208;(RADA)4&#8208;DGDRGDS (HRR) hydrogel loaded with epidermal growth factor (EGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT3), and glial&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), flanked by gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels containing catalase at both ends. The hybrid conduit enables the spatiotemporal release of multiple bioactive factors, precisely targeting critical pathological cascades after SCI. This approach reduces oxidative stress, promotes neuronal survival at the lesion borders, facilitates the relay of ascending and descending axons, and enhances signal transmission across the lesion. Restored serotonergic signaling enhances motor neuron excitability, facilitating functional recovery, while reconstitution of bladder reflexes improves urinary control. By orchestrating the reinstatement of multiple essential mechanisms to counteract the pathological progression of the hostile post&#8208;SCI microenvironment, this approach provides a strategy for regenerative therapies targeting SCI.

         <title>Biologically Switchable Volatility and Nonvolatility Toward Real Neurotransmitter Mediated Aqueous Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on neurotransmitter glutamate&#8208;mediated volatility and nonvolatility of a PCN&#8208;224/WO3&#8208;gated organic photoelectrochemical transistor, a complete aqueous reservoir computing system is developed and implemented for image preprocessing and recognition, in which the reservoir is constructed based on the volatile property, while the readout network is operated upon the nonvolatile property of the device.








Abstract
The study on aqueous reservoir computing (RC) has just come into being. Nevertheless, aqueous RC still faces significant challenges. Recently, with the participation of real biological receptors, aqueous neuromorphic engineering is promising to emulate the intricate human brain more closely due to their synaptic resemblance in electrolytes. In this work, biologically switchable volatility and nonvolatility are first explored for real neurotransmitter glutamate&#8208;mediated aqueous RC application, which is based on rational synergy between glutamate oxidase catalytic chemistry and porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework/tungsten oxide (PCN&#8208;224/WO3) photogate in the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor. As a proof of concept, the glutamate&#8208;mediated RC is then developed and explored for image recognition. These results have of potential for advancing real neurotransmitter&#8208;mediated aqueous RC toward in&#8208;biology application, which are also envisaged to promote bioinspired algorithm&#8208;hardware codesign in future aqueous neuromorphic engineering.

         <title>Microstructure Optimization via Grain&#8208;Boundary Segregation to Enhance DC Bias Dielectric Performance of BaTiO3 Multilayer Ceramic Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By tuning grain size through nanoscale grain&#8208;boundary segregation of single&#8208;element additives, high&#8208;performance BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) exhibit exceptionally low dielectric loss over a wide frequency range and excellent thermal stability. In particular, an optimal grain size is identified for maximizing effective capacitance under high DC bias fields, offering a key strategy to enable thinner dielectric layers in future MLCCs.








Abstract
BaTiO&#8323;&#8208;based multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) are essential components in modern electronics. To enhance overall capacitance, achieving thinner ceramic layers has become a primary issue. However, this introduces two major challenges: controlling grain size during processing and ensuring stability under high electric fields. In this study, a novel strategy employing single&#8208;element additives such as Fe3&#8314; and Ni2&#8314; is presented to effectively suppress grain growth. These additives strongly segregate at grain boundaries, thereby limiting grain coarsening during sintering and enabling fine&#8208;grained microstructures. The optimized BaTiO&#8323; samples, free of costly rare&#8208;earth elements, exhibit stable high permittivity (&#8776;103), low dielectric loss, and improved reliability across varying temperatures and frequencies. More importantly, we identify the ideal grain size of &#8776;200&#160;nm for maximizing capacitance under a DC bias exceeding 4&#160;V&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1. The findings suggest that further reducing the dielectric layer thickness to 200&#160;nm represents a promising direction for future MLCCs.

         <title>Inter&#8208;Ring Bonding Electron Donor Structure Triggers Efficient Two&#8208;Electron Water Oxidation for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By introducing an inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure with two linked phenyl rings, electron delocalization within the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) is enhanced. This increased delocalization improves the photocatalyst's oxidation capability and facilitates hole distribution at low&#8208;energy barrier sites, thereby triggering the efficient two&#8208;electron water oxidation reactions (2e&#8722; WOR).








Abstract
Low water oxidation efficiency is a major barrier to efficient photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) synthesis under sacrificial agent&#8208;free conditions. Among various water oxidation pathways, the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8722; WOR) is promising due to its direct H2O2 generation and kinetic advantages. However, effective strategies to trigger the efficient 2e&#8722; WOR remain insufficient. In this study, conjugated polymers with alternating electron donor and acceptor units are designed and synthesized. By introducing an inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure with two linked phenyl rings, the efficient 2e&#8722; WOR is initiated, increasing H2O2 synthesis efficiency from 1657 to 4401 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and achieving a solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 1.25%. In&#8208;depth studies reveal that the 2e&#8722; WOR is initiated by the inter&#8208;ring bonding electron donor structure, which enhances electron delocalization in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), increasing the valence band potential from 1.6 to 1.8 V, thereby meeting the oxidation potential required for the 2e&#8722; WOR. Additionally, this structure promotes hole accumulation at low&#8208;energy barrier sites, boosting water oxidation efficiency from 874 to 2767 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This work presents a promising strategy for improving photocatalytic water oxidation efficiency, advancing sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Synthesis of 2D Semiconductor Lateral Patterned Heterostructures Through Carving and Follow&#8208;Up Robust Epitaxial Growth Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using high&#8208;speed laser carving to achieve precisely controlled two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductor material patterns. These patterns serve as a stable template for the lateral epitaxial growth of other 2D materials, enabling the fabrication of 2D lateral periodic heterostructures, heterostructure crossbar arrays, and patterned heterostructures.








Abstract
Precise control over the spatial distribution of chemical composition and electronic structure in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors is essential for the development of next&#8208;generation integrated circuits. However, fabricating 2D lateral patterned heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces and high spatial periodicity remains a significant challenge. Herein, this work reports a general strategy to synthesize 2D semiconductor lateral patterned heterostructures through carving of 2D semiconductor single crystal and the follow&#8208;up robust epitaxial growth approach. Using the high&#8208;speed laser carving (HSLC) technique, this work obtains precisely controlled 2D semiconductor material patterns with clean edges, which are used as a robust template for laterally epitaxial growth to produce 2D lateral periodic heterostructures, heterostructure crossbar arrays and other complex patterned heterostructures. Systematic microscopic and spectral characterization reveal that heterostructures have atomically sharp interlines. The high periodicity of these heterostructures facilitates scalable device integration, providing a practical route toward large&#8208;area 2D electronic circuits. By constructing functional electronic components such as p&#8208;n diode and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) inverters arrays, this work demonstrates the potential of these heterostructures for monolithic circuit applications. This technique offers a new idea for micro/nano machining of 2D materials and lays a foundation for large&#8208;scale integrated circuits based on 2D semiconductors.

A bamboo&#8208;inspired composite conduit is designed to promote the repair of long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury, where a directional hollow&#8208;tube bilayer structure provides topological guidance for cell migration, and the newly discovered piezoelectric property of poly(vinyl alcohol) of exceeding 100 mV enhances axon length by 3.1 times, ultimately improving nerve regeneration efficiency through accelerating neuronal migration, axonal extension, and vascularization.








Abstract
Slow axon growth is a critical factor that limits regeneration after long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Herein, a bamboo&#8208;inspired scaffold accelerates nerve regeneration through a directional hollow&#8208;tube bilayer structure and biomimetic piezoelectric property. The outer hydrogel of the scaffold exhibits sufficient fatigue resistance after 100 cycles of stretching, while the interior fiber provides an oriented topological cue. Inspired by the bending&#8208;piezoelectric property of bamboo cellulose, the piezoelectric signal in poly(vinyl alcohol) is detected for the first time, measuring approximately 20&#160;mV. To enhance voltage&#8208;driven nerve regeneration, the scaffold's piezoelectricity is improved to 0.95 &#177; 0.02&#160;V by optimizing its non&#8208;centrosymmetric structure, increasing permanent dipole moment, and facilitating electron&#8208;hole separation. Owing to its biomimetic structure and piezoelectricity, the scaffold promotes a 3.1&#8208;fold increase in axon length, a 1.6&#8208;fold improvement in myelin diameter, and maximizes angiogenesis, reaching 71.25 &#177; 21.87 vessels per mm2 in vivo. Overall, this bamboo&#8208;inspired conduit has the potential to significantly improve regeneration efficiency and functional reconstruction in cases of long&#8208;segment PNI.

         <title>Vascular&#8208;Mimetic 2D Membranes with Hemoglobin Catalysis for Efficient Uranium Extraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
GO in GO&#8208;RBC membranes induces the reorganization of phospholipid bilayers to form hydrophobic &#8220;hemoglobin islands&#8221; embedded in a hydrophilic &#8220;phospholipid sea&#8221;. This structure forces the uranium ions to move along an &#8220;S&#8221; shaped trajectory, which greatly enhances their interaction with hemoglobin and improves the ability to catalyze the conversion of uranium (VI) to uranium (IV).








Abstract
The extraction of uranium from seawater is crucial for sustainable nuclear energy development but is challenged by its ultralow concentration, the presence of competing ions, and the high energy demands of conventional methods. Membrane separation is a promising alternative, owing to its in simplicity, low energy consumption, and scalability. However, current membranes fail to achieve the selectivity and efficiency required for uranium capture. Herein, this study introduces a bioinspired graphene oxide&#8208;red blood cells (GO&#8208;RBC) membrane, that mimics vascular transport for ultra&#8208;selective uranium extraction. In the innovative GO&#8208;induced remodeling of red blood cell, hemoglobin (Hb) adsorbs onto the hydrophobic regions of GO and, phospholipids self&#8208;assemble into concentric hydrophilic rings around Hb. This unique &#8220;island&#8208;reef&#8221; structure within the membrane channels forces ions to follow an S&#8208;shaped path, thereby enhancing interactions with Hb. In addition, Hb catalytically reduces U(VI) to U(IV), enabling trapping of uranium while allowing competing ions to pass through. The membrane achieves an unprecedented U/V selectivity (110.6), far outperforming current technologies. Moreover, the GO&#8208;RBC membrane exhibited exceptional antifouling properties, mechanical robustness, and long&#8208;term stability. This study provides a scalable, energy&#8208;efficient solution for uranium extraction from seawater, further opening new pathways for the development of biomimetic membranes for application in resource recovery.

A Generative Artificial Intelligence Driven Workflow for the Discovery of Novel Magnesium&#8208;Based Solvents.








Abstract
Traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods are inefficient and costly in discovering novel solvents for next&#8208;generation magnesium (Mg) metal&#8208;based batteries. Therefore, this work establishes a simple yet efficient screening criterion for solvents by integrating artificial intelligence techniques with a virtual molecular database, potentially revolutionizing the traditional solvent design pathway. A total of 823 solvents are generated using a self&#8208;developed algorithm, and LUMO, &#916;LUMO, ESPmin, ESPmax&#8201;, and Eb are identified to establish the screening criterion through the analysis with machine learning (ML) models. Eighteen candidate solvents are successfully identified, and two of which are subsequently selected and experimentally validated, i.e., C1COCOC1 and COCC(C)OC (abbreviated as &#8220;DOX&#8221; and &#8220;DMP&#8221;). Notably, neither of these solvents has been previously reported for use in Mg batteries. Experimental results indicate that the DOX solvent, when paired with the Mg boron&#8208;based salt, i.e., Mg[B(hfip)4]2, can significantly enhance the electrochemical performance. At a current density of 1.0&#8201;mAcm&#8722;2, the average coulombic efficiency for Mg plating/stripping reaches 99.54&#8201;% after 5200 cycles. Furthermore, the Mg//Cu cell achieves a cumulative capacity exceeding 2000&#8201;mAhcm&#8722;2, surpassing previously reported results. In summary, this work establishes a virtual molecular database and develops a streamlined screening methodology for Mg battery solvents based on their physicochemical properties, reducing the candidate pool from 823 to 18 and improving efficiency by nearly 50&#8208;fold. This research paradigm is not limited to the development of Mg batteries and can be readily extended to the exploration of other battery systems.

         <title>Spatially Encoded Polaritonic Ultra&#8208;Strong Coupling in Gradient Metasurfaces with Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi&#8208;bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate ultra&#8208;strong coupling to an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero mode in an ultra&#8208;thin SiO2 layer.The platform achieves exceptional mode overlap, reaching a normalized coupling strength of &#951; = 0.10&#8197;and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero mode energy.








Abstract
A platform is introduced to achieve ultra&#8208;strong coupling (USC) between light and matter using widely available materials. USC is a light&#8211;matter interaction regime characterized by coupling strengths exceeding 10% of the ground state energy. It gives rise to novel physical phenomena, such as efficient single&#8208;photon coupling and quantum gates, with applications in quantum sensing, nonlinear optics, and low&#8208;threshold lasing. Although early demonstrations in plasmonic systems have been realized, achieving USC in dielectric platforms, which offer lower losses and high Q&#8208;factors, remains challenging due to typically low mode overlap between the photonic field and the material resonance. Here, dielectric dual gradient metasurfaces supporting quasi&#8208;bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum are leveraged to spatially encode both the spectral and coupling parameter space and demonstrate USC to an epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) mode in an ultra&#8208;thin SiO2 layer. The strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric fields in tapered bar structure overlap exceptionally well with those of the ENZ mode, resulting in a normalized coupling strength of &#951; = 0.10&#8197;and a mode splitting equivalent to 20% of the ENZ mode energy; a four&#8208;to&#8208;five&#8208;fold increase compared to previous approaches. The strong field confinement of the approach opens new possibilities for compact and scalable polaritonic devices, such as tunable frequency converters and low&#8208;energy optical modulators.

         <dc:description>
In this research, a multifunctional nanovesicle platform is prepared, combining membrane&#8208;disruptive sulfonium polypeptoids, pH&#8208;responsive polypeptoids for acid&#8208;triggered amine release, enzymatic cell wall degradation via lysostaphin, and targeted delivery using D&#8208;phenylalanine ligands. This precision&#8208;guided system integrates synergistic antibacterial mechanisms to effectively tackle drug&#8208;resistant bacteria in various tissue environments.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), classified as a high&#8208;priority tier II pathogen, poses a glowing threat to global health. Single&#8208;mode antibacterial approaches often fall short of achieving optimal effects, necessitating the development of combination therapies. To address these challenges, pH&#8208;responsive antibacterial nanovesicles, termed DAClLy, are developed by integrating targeting ligand and multiple antimicrobial agents with complementary modes of action to target MDR bacteria with enhanced efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. DAClLy are engineered through the complexation of sulfonium&#8208;ion&#8208;bearing antibacterial polypeptoids, and primary amine&#8208;containing polypeptoids modified with 2,3&#8208;dimethyl maleic anhydride, encapsulating lysostaphin, a bacteriolytic enzyme. Upon reaching the acidic microenvironment of bacterial infections, the DAClLy vesicles disassemble, releasing their antimicrobial components. The released lysostaphin degrades bacterial cell walls, while the polypeptoids synergistically disrupt bacterial membranes, resulting in a multi&#8208;action bactericidal effect. This synergistic mechanism demonstrates remarkable efficacy against MDR S. aureus, including its resilient biofilm formations. In vivo studies have shown that the DAClLy vesicles exhibit potent antibacterial activity against MDR S. aureus&#8208;induced skin and lung infections. The nanovesicles effectively penetrate the lung mucus barrier, addressing both surface&#8208;level and deep&#8208;tissue infections. By integrating multiple strategies, DAClLy offers a promising therapeutic strategy to combat MDR pathogens across diverse tissue contexts.

&lt;p&gt;In this research, a multifunctional nanovesicle platform is prepared, combining membrane-disruptive sulfonium polypeptoids, pH-responsive polypeptoids for acid-triggered amine release, enzymatic cell wall degradation via lysostaphin, and targeted delivery using &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-phenylalanine ligands. This precision-guided system integrates synergistic antibacterial mechanisms to effectively tackle drug-resistant bacteria in various tissue environments.

         <title>Gridized Nanopolymer Catalysis with Atomically Dispersed Iron Achieves the Nearly 100% Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol From CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe&#8208;based nanomolecular/nanopolymer catalysts with super&#8208;hindrance and low&#8208;coordination Fe sites enable efficient CO2 electroreduction to methanol (CH3OH). The super&#8208;hindrance prevents aggregation to guarantee active site dispersion. The stronger *CO adsorption, compared to Fe porphyrin, is crucial for the high selective production of CH3OH instead of CO. Fe&#8208;based nanopolymer catalyst demonstrates 60.5% CH3OH FE, 98.3% CH3OH selectivity, and 100 h stability in an H&#8208;cell.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of CO2 to methanol (CH3OH) offers a highly promising avenue for zero&#8208;emission carbon recycling and renewable energy storage. However, achieving high CH3OH selectivity and long&#8208;term stability in catalysts remains rare, presenting central challenges on the path to their commercialization. It is emerging to make multiscale design of metal centers of active sites and their surrounding environments under the crucial mechanism of pathway selection. Herein, the gridized nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysts are reported for high effective electroreduction of CO2 to CH3OH. An A&#8208;type nanogrid (AG) and its organic nanopolymers with atomically dispersed iron (Fe) are well identified with the unique catalytic active sites of Fe&#8208;N1C3Cl1. Notably, Fe&#8208;based AG nanopolymer (FePAG) catalyst exhibits a CH3OH Faradaic efficiency of 60.5%, a CH3OH selectivity of 98.3%, and a stability of up to 100 h, outperforming currently reported molecular catalysts. The superior selectivity is probably attributed to the cooperation between the stronger *CO adsorption and the super&#8208;hindrance that suppresses aggregates to guarantee the dispersion of single active sites. This study provides new insights in the exploration of nanomolecular and nanopolymer catalysis.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Nanoagents with Efficient Free Radicals Generation and Photothermal Conversion Performance for Enhanced Tumor Photoimmunotherapy via Targeting Lactate Metabolism&#8208;Immune Circuit Rewiring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a lactate metabolism&#8208;immune circuit rewiring strategy using L8@SY NPs to inhibit lactate efflux and enhance photoimmunotherapy. L8@SY NPs with high free radical generation and photothermal conversion performance can induce immunogenic cell death. Meanwhile, lactate efflux blockade effectively augments photoimmunotherapy by reshaping the immunosuppressive microenvironment, demonstrating significant tumor growth suppression and reduced metastasis.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) have emerged as promising modalities against tumor growth and distant metastases via inducing apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). However, their therapeutic efficacy is profoundly compromised by the acidic tumor microenvironment fueled by lactate extrusion, orchestrating multifaceted immunosuppression. Herein, a lactate metabolism checkpoint blockade strategy targeting monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) is proposed to augment photoimmunotherapy by co&#8208;delivering MCT4 inhibitor syrosingopine (SY) and a phototheranostic agent L8BO (L8). Boasting robust intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics and an extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated architecture with lengthy alkyl chains, L8 possesses a diminished singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#8710;S&#8208;T) alongside elevated light&#8208;harvesting property, achieving exceptional free radicals generation and 46.2% photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE). Triggered by lactate sequestration&#8208;induced intracellular acidification, L8@SY nanoparticles (NPs)&#8208;enabled photoimmunotherapy potently activates dendritic cells (DCs) maturation while eliciting substantial infiltration of T lymphocytes. Concurrently, natural killer (NK) cell activation and memory T&#8208;cell differentiation are achieved, thereby suppressing both localized and distal tumor progression whilst concomitantly curtailing pulmonary metastatic dissemination. In brief, this study provides a novel combinatorial paradigm to potentiate photoimmunotherapy by targeting the lactate metabolism&#8208;immune circuit rewiring strategy.

         <title>Recyclable Polyurethane Thermosets with High Rigidness and Toughness via Side Chain Induced Dual Phase Separation Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A recyclable rigid polyurethane thermoset is presented via a side chain&#8208;induced dual phase separation strategy. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded hard domains and side&#8208;chain nanodomains synergistically enhance toughness, while urethane transesterification ensures catalyst&#8208;free reprocessability. The material achieves high modulus (1.13 GPa), exceptional toughness (77.8 MJ m&#8722;3), and demonstrates recyclability in glass fiber composites.








Abstract
Polyurethane thermosets with high strength, rigidity, and cost efficiency are highly desirable for industrial applications. However, they always suffer from brittleness and poor recyclability owing to their crosslinked structure, causing an unacceptable level of sustainability concerns. Here, a side chain induced dual phase separation strategy is proposed to tackle these limitations. Specifically, a crosslinked rigid polyurethane is designed, synthesized from small&#8208;molecule diols with a side chain. The urethane groups form hard domains by hydrogen bonding and induce a primary phase separation. Moreover, the curing process immobilizes part of the polymer segments with side chains to promote a secondary phase separation and generate a heterogeneous crosslinked structure. The primary phase separation enables energy dissipation, while the secondary phase separation serves as stress concentrations or crack initiation points to enhance the toughness. Notably, the transesterification between urethane groups, coupled with hydrogen bonding, facilitates catalyst&#8208;free reprocessability, extending thermosets lifespan. This recyclable polyurethane thermoset exhibits a high Young's modulus (1.13 GPa) and exceptional toughness (77.76 MJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Furthermore, its application and recyclability in glass fiber&#8208;reinforced composites are demonstrated. This strategy provides a viable route toward sustainable thermosetting polymers, addressing key environmental concerns associated with their widespread use.

         <title>Fine and Uniform Ultrathin Film Coating on Fiber via Nonequilibrium Liquid/Liquid Interfacial Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber coated with an unprecedentedly micro&#8208;/nanoscale uniform layer, which is long&#8208;sought&#8208;after yet unachievable by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art coating technologies, is constructed by locking even liquid film on the fiber in a multiphase fluid coating. The resultant coated composite fiber owns highly efficient function coupling (e.g., supersensitive sensing feature), and can be widespreadly applied to fabric devices.








Abstract
Coating a thin layer on fibers enables their function coupling or integration into differentiated wearable devices, or may unlock unexplored potentials. The thin layer coating's uniformity and controllability is the prerequisite to ensure device's efficiency, but remain, yet, a formidable challenge. Currently, only a few specific composite fibers have been fabricated from flow coating associated with rapid polymerizing liquid monomers, fibers&#8217; parallel handling, or physical scraping, seriously lacking fineness and universality, especially inability reaching nanometer or sub&#8208;micrometer thickness coating.

     alt="Fine and Uniform Ultrathin Film Coating on Fiber via Nonequilibrium Liquid/Liquid Interfacial Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fiber coated with an unprecedentedly micro-/nanoscale uniform layer, which is long-sought-after yet unachievable by the state-of-the-art coating technologies, is constructed by locking even liquid film on the fiber in a multiphase fluid coating. The resultant coated composite fiber owns highly efficient function coupling (e.g., supersensitive sensing feature), and can be widespreadly applied to fabric devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coating a thin layer on fibers enables their function coupling or integration into differentiated wearable devices, or may unlock unexplored potentials. The thin layer coating's uniformity and controllability is the prerequisite to ensure device's efficiency, but remain, yet, a formidable challenge. Currently, only a few specific composite fibers have been fabricated from flow coating associated with rapid polymerizing liquid monomers, fibers&#8217; parallel handling, or physical scraping, seriously lacking fineness and universality, especially inability reaching nanometer or sub-micrometer thickness coating. Here, a new method of coating an even liquid film on fiber in another immiscible liquid via capitalizing on fast interfacial jamming of nanoparticles at the liquid/liquid interface is proposed. The consequently dried uniform, ultrathin common polymer or composite (predissolved in coated liquid) coating&#8212;with otherwise unattainable thickness ranging 50 nm&#8211;20 &#181;m&#8212;offers fiber with high device performance, including robust service in extreme circumstances (allowing Cu fiber work over the whole range of pH), high efficient display function (with luminous elements &amp;lt;0.01%), and supersensitive sensing with sensor's resistance variation over 90% by less 1 N pressure. The strategy can find extensively diverse applications in wearable electronics and intelligent textiles, as fiber, chemicals of coating liquid, and components, are variable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Prestressed Niobium Tungsten Oxide Enables Near&#8208;Zero Volume Change and Ultrafast Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
By one&#8208;step slow&#8208;gradient thermal synthesis strategy to precisely regulate lattice distortion, a novel lattice&#8208;prestressed Nb14W3O44 overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near&#8208;zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage during cycling. This prestressed structure delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and no risk of the battery catching fire or exploding under severe stress conditions.








Abstract
Niobium tungsten oxide offers rapid ionic transport and high safety in fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but suffers from challenges of large structure stresses and low capacity retention at rates exceeding 20C. Here, a novel lattice&#8208;prestressed Nb14W3O44 (LP&#8208;NWO) is reported that overcomes its intrinsic structural limitations, enabling near&#8208;zero volume change and ultrafast lithium storage. The lattice&#8208;prestressed structure involves the alternating distribution of 4&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#215;&#8734; and 4&#160;&#215;&#160;3&#215;&#8734; rectangle units, along with octahedra distortion, which leads to the formation of specific and ordered lattice prestresses. The rectangle units induce tensile stresses, while the octahedra distortion results in compressive stresses. This prestressed structure not only preserves continuous diffusion channels but also enhances both ion and electron conductivity. Importantly, the presence of prestress greatly relieves the strain generated during lithium insertion and extraction. This can be observed through a reversible curve&#8208;to&#8208;straight evolution of lattice fringes, resulting in near&#8208;zero volume change during cycling. The LP&#8208;NWO delivers a 78% capacity retention at 100C after 20&#160;000 cycles and more than 2&#160;000 cycles of full cells at 50C, as well as no safety risk under severe stress conditions. This prestressed strategy offers implications for the development of zero&#8208;strain electrodes, aiming to overcome fast&#8208;charge limitations through internal means.

         <title>A Multimodal Smart Window with Visible&#8208;NIR&#8208;LWIR Electro&#8208;Modulation for All Weather</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart windows with dynamic regulation of solar visible/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) transmittance and long&#8208;wave infrared (LWIR) emittance present a crucial solution for improving building energy efficiency. We demonstrate a multimodal smart window with independent electro&#8208;modulation for visible, NIR, and LWIR, ensuring thermal comfort and energy conservation for all weather while offering multifunctionalities of illumination, glare reduction, and privacy protection.








Abstract
Intelligent modulation of solar and thermal radiation for a smart window, including visible, near&#8208;infrared (NIR), and long&#8208;wave infrared (LWIR) spectral tri&#8208;bands (0.38&#8211;25&#160;&#181;m), to achieve indoor comfort and energy efficiency is a critical frontier in sustainable building design. However, independent regulations of multi&#8208;functional radiation of visible lighting, NIR heating, and LWIR radiative cooling for dynamic operational requirements and weather conditions are not fully solved. A PET/ITO/PB/Pt&#8208;NPs electrode featuring separated reactions of ion insertion and metal electrodeposition for dual&#8208;band modulation of visible and NIR via precise potential control, enabling multifunctionalities such as illumination, glare reduction, and privacy protection is proposed. A multimodal smart window of lighting&#8208;heating&#8208;emitting electro&#8208;modulation device (LHE&#8208;ED), wherein electrochromism and dynamic emittance are delicately manipulated for tri&#8208;band modulation, possesses six independent electro&#8208;driven states of multi&#8208;scene lighting&#8208;heating&#8208;emitting regulations for the first time, exhibiting excellent wavelength selectivity of &#9651;TVis&#160;=&#160;41.24%, &#9651;TNIR&#160;=&#160;53.95%, and &#916;&#949;8&#8208;13&#160;&#181;m&#160;=&#160;0.35. Building energy simulations demonstrate the LHE&#8208;ED outperforms commercial low&#8208;E glass across diverse climate zones, showcasing a maximum reduction in CO2 emissions of 34.01&#160;kg&#160;(m2&#160;year)&#8722;1 and a decrease in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)&#160;energy consumption by 34.18% annually, which paves the way for next&#8208;generation smart window in terms of energy saving and environmental preservation.

         <title>Levetiracetam&#8208;Assisted Perovskite Crystallization and Tripartite Lead Iodide Reduction in Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method for suppressing residual PbI2: Add chiral LEV molecules to the PbI2 precursor solution to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, release intracellular stress, passivate vacancies and defects, reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk, and achieve highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Sequential deposition technique is widely used to fabricate perovskite films with large grain size in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Residual lead halide (PbI2) in the perovskite film tends to be decomposed into metallic lead (Pb0) under long&#8208;term heating or light soaking. Here, a chiral levetiracetam (LEV) dopant containing &#945;&#8208;amide and pyrrolidone groups is introduced into the PbI2 precursor solution. The carbonyl oxygen (labeled O1) and amide oxygen (labeled O2) in the pyrrolidone ring have significant electronegativity and form coordination bonds with Pb2+ ions through electron transfer, thereby regulating the nucleation and crystallization process of perovskite. The chirality of LEV induces spatial selectivity in perovskite precursor coordination, promoting oriented growth along the (100) crystallographic facet. Additionally, it enables selective defect passivation, preferentially addressing Pb and I vacancies. Ultimately, LEV doping reduces the tripartite residual PbI2 in the perovskite film, including multi&#8208;interfaces and bulk. Besides, the resulted PSCs achieved a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 26% with a stabilized power output of 25.8% and maintained 90% of its initial PCE after maximum power point tracking for 1000 h. This study offers a novel research paradigm to advance the development of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Inch Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal with High Irradiation Resistance for X&#8208;ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 SC were grown with vertical Bridgman method, and the X&#8208;ray detection stability of Au/CsPbBr3/Bi devices after high&#8208;dose irradiation was investigated. We found the change in the Fermi level after irradiation endows the enhancement in sensitivity, demonstrating ultra&#8208;high irradiation hardness for the devices.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 crystals have demonstrated considerable promise in &#947;&#8208;ray and X&#8208;ray detection, owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. However, the growth of large single crystals (SCs) and the stability of CsPbBr3&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detectors under high&#8208;energy radiation exposure remain unexplored. In this study, a two&#8208;inch CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal is grown using the vertical Bridgman (VB) method, and its irradiation resistance in X&#8208;ray detection performance is investigated after exposure to 60Co &#947;&#8208;ray radiation. Compared with unirradiated samples, the crystals irradiated with a dose of 10&#160;Mrad exhibit a higher trap density (1.59 &#215; 1010 cm&#8722;3) and a lower resistivity (8.2 &#215; 107 &#937; cm). However, the Bi/CsPbBr3/Au devices with asymmetric electrode structure exhibit an enhanced signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (14), a stable and low dark current density (7 nA cm&#8722;2) with a current drift of 5.8 &#215; 10&#8722;15 A cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1, and a high sensitivity of 55722 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 for X&#8208;ray detection at an electric field of 3000&#160;V cm&#8722;1. Moreover, the irradiated device remained stable X&#8208;ray response characteristics after 220 days aging. These findings highlight the exceptional defect tolerance and irradiation stability of CsPbBr3 devices for high&#8208;performance radiation detections, offering critical insights for their long&#8208;term deployment in high&#8208;radiation environments.

         <title>Synergies Between Atomically Dispersed Ru Single Atoms and Nanoparticles on CeAlOx for Enhanced Photo&#8208;Thermal Catalytic CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an efficient strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of CO2 hydrogenation to CH4 by fabricating Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalysts that harness the synergistic effects of Ru single atoms and nanoparticles. Ru single atoms facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H2 dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts integrating single&#8208;atom species and nanoparticles maximize atom utilization and hydrogen dissociation for hydrogenation reactions. However, challenges in maintaining consistent metal loadings during synthesis complicate direct performance comparisons with the single&#8208;atom and nanoparticle&#8208;based systems, which obscures rational assessment of their catalytic potential. Herein, Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx photothermal catalysts are reported which leverage the synergy between Ru single atoms and Ru nanoparticles to enhance CO2 hydrogenation to CH4. Under light irradiation (3.1 W cm&#8722;2, 200&#8211;1100 nm) at 200&#160;&#176;C, the Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalyst achieves a CH4 production rate of 197.2 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with near&#8208;100% selectivity, surpassing single&#8208;atom Ru1/CeAlOx catalysts and nanoparticle&#8208;based RuNPs/CeAlOx catalysts, with equivalent metal contents. Mechanistic studies revealed that in Ru1+NPs/CeAlOx catalysts, Ru single atoms facilitate CO2 adsorption/activation and subsequent conversion, while Ru nanoparticles promote H2 dissociation, with their synergistic interplay driving superior performance. Moreover, the CeAlOx support effectively stabilizes the dual&#8208;site structure and facilitates the formation of reaction intermediates through its abundant oxygen vacancies and surface Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs, thereby further enhancing the catalytic reaction. This work highlights the critical role of synergistic effects between single atoms and nanoparticles, offering new approaches for designing high&#8208;efficiency hydrogenation catalysts.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Free Transfer of Wafer&#8208;Scale Freestanding Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanomembranes Enabled by Elastically Graded Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastically graded polymer (EGP) support is developed to achieve wafer&#8208;scale crack&#8208;free transfer of freestanding single&#8208;crystalline oxide membranes. The engineered elastic gradient accommodates tensile and compressive strain by tuning interfacial stiffness, effectively minimizing crack formation during lift&#8208;off. Using this approach, large&#8208;area membranes exhibit pristine surfaces with &#8776;99% intactness, overcoming the critical fracture bottleneck.








Abstract
Freestanding single&#8208;crystalline nanomembranes have gained increasing attention as promising platforms for both fundamental research and advanced electronic applications. However, internal stress gradients arising from epitaxial strain within the oxide membranes often result in high crack density during fabrication, leading to unsatisfactory yield and limited reliability. Here, an elastically graded polymer (EGP) support that enables wafer&#8208;scale crack&#8208;free transfer of single&#8208;crystalline oxide membranes are developed. The engineered elastic gradient within the EGP accommodates the internal strain of the oxide membrane, effectively minimizing crack formation during lift&#8208;off. Notably, this ability to spatially control the interfacial stiffness between the polymer and the oxide film enables crack suppression under both tensile and compressive strain. This approach provides a robust and scalable route to producing high&#8208;quality freestanding oxide membranes, paving the way not only for their integration into novel device architecture but also opening new avenues for scientific exploration of functional systems.

         <title>A Trilayer Nanofluidic Ionic Diode for High&#8208;Performance Moisture&#8208;Enabled Energy Harvesting and Ionic Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the design of p&#8208;i&#8208;n solar cells, the first trilayer p&#8208;i&#8208;n moist&#8208;electric generator has been developed. This device integrates a positively charged (p&#8208;type) layer, a neutral hygroscopic layer (i&#8208;type), and a negatively charged (n&#8208;type) layer, overcoming the limitations of conventional bilayer p&#8208;n devices and enabling the integration of efficient carrier generation with controllable carrier transport.








Abstract
Nanofluidic ionic diodes enable directional ion transport through confined nanochannels, holding great promise for energy harvesting and iontronic applications. However, their development in moisture&#8208;enabled power generation remains limited by insufficient carrier generation and unstable device performance. Here, a trilayer nanofluidic ionic diode&#8208;based moist&#8208;electric generator is reported, integrating positively charged fabrics, lithium chloride&#8208;doped neutral fabrics, and negatively charged fabrics into a p&#8208;i&#8208;n configuration. The hygroscopic neutral layer promotes efficient moisture absorption and ion dissociation, while the adjacent charged layers, featuring nanochannels formed by graphene oxides, establish a built&#8208;in electric field to rectify cation and anion fluxes. This unique structural and functional synergy enables continuous carrier generation and directional transport, achieving both a remarkable voltage of &#8776;1.38 V and a current of &#8776;35 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 and further exhibiting a peak voltage of &#8776;1.6 V with stable operation for over 600 h by employing active metal electrodes. Beyond energy harvesting, the diode&#8208;like rectification allows implementation of ionic logic gates and foldable configurations for powering portable electronics. This work establishes a versatile platform for high&#8208;performance nanofluidic diode&#8208;based devices, bridging sustainable power generation with emerging iontronic systems.

         <title>Covalent Organic Framework and Carbon Nitride Composite for Scalable Solar Reforming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modular composite, containing a covalent organic framework, indium tin oxide, carbon nitride and nickel based molecular catalyst, enables solar reforming under neutral aqueous conditions, converting polyols and sugars into formate while generating H2. The composite forms scalable photoleaf and photopanel devices, achieving continuous solar&#8208;driven waste valorization and hydrogen production outdoors.








Abstract
Solar reforming uses sunlight to valorize waste and offers a promising route to circular chemistry, but most current systems operate under corrosive conditions, lack scalability and processability, or suffer from poor selectivity in oxidative waste valorization. Here, a modular composite photocatalyst, comprising a crystalline covalent organic framework (COF), cyanamide&#8208;functionalized carbon nitride (CNx), indium tin oxide (ITO), and a nickel&#8208;based molecular catalyst (NiME), capable of driving selective waste valorization and H2 generation using visible light under pH neutral aqueous conditions is reported. The porous structure of the COF provides nanoconfinement, thereby supporting the targeted oxidation of polyols and sugars into formate (HCOO&#8722;), while carbon nitride in the presence of the molecular catalyst facilitates H2 evolution. ITO functions as a solid&#8208;state electron mediator, enabling coupled oxidative and reductive processes for the concurrent solar&#8208;driven production of H2 and HCOO&#8722;. The high processability of the COF|ITO|CNx|NiME composite allows for the construction of a standalone photoleaf and photopanel, which have been integrated into a single&#8208;window and a scalable multi&#8208;window reactor, respectively. Continuous operability over seven days, along with testing under outdoor conditions with pretreated plastic under direct sunlight, offers a pathway toward practical and scalable solar reforming using structurally tunable organic semiconductor composites.

         <title>Dynamic Protective Multi&#8208;Layers for MnO2 Cathodes: Ion Sorting and Structural Protection for Superior Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired dynamic multi&#8208;layer interface combines a stable outer shield, an Mn2+ selective buffer, and a conductive base enriched with oxygen vacancies. The cooperative architecture blocks manganese dissolution, relieves lattice strain, and accelerates ion and electron transport, addressing key stability and kinetic bottlenecks of MnO2 cathodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) are characterized by high safety, low cost, and eco&#8208;friendliness, among which manganese&#8208;based cathodes stand out due to their abundance and high theoretical capacity. However, failure behaviors such as lattice collapse, Mn dissolution, and sluggish kinetics hinder their application. Herein, a dynamic multi&#8208;protective interface has been designed through a simple one&#8208;step manufacturing process, emulating the structural and functional attributes of biological membranes and cell walls. It comprises three distinct layers: an outer high&#8208;valent oxide layer that enhances chemical stability and selectively facilitates proton intercalation while governing the intercalation of Zn2+; a middle low&#8208;valent oxide and metal composite layer, which functions as a buffer to selectively adsorb Mn2+, thereby inhibiting Mn dissolution and augmenting the chemical stability of the cathode; and an inner heterojunction layer, which boosts conductivity and alleviates Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion through lattice distortion and entropy&#8208;mediated electronic delocalization. The surface modified cathode exhibits outstanding stability, with nearly zero capacity decay observed over 300 cycles at a low current density of 0.4 A g&#8722;1, and 15&#160;000 cycles under a high current of 10 A g&#8722;1. With significantly enhanced cycling stability, rate capability, and electrochemical reversibility, this strategy presents a promising solution for high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8208;based cathodes in AZMBs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Anchored Ionic Bond Mediators Enabling Controllable Monolayer Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pre&#8208;anchoring Arg on NiOx concurrently mitigates SAM amphiphilicity via ionic bonding and suppresses SAM self&#8208;aggregation by acting as a physical barrier. This bifunctional mechanism enables rapid, controlled assembly of dense, uniform SAM monolayers, yielding PCEs of 26.67% (small&#8208;area PSC, active area: 0.049 cm2) and 21.05% (module, active area: 64.68 cm2).








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) has emerged as an indispensable hole&#8208;selective contact for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the formation of dense, uniform SAMs via wet deposition poses challenges due to two thermodynamically feasible yet competing processes: the self&#8208;aggregation of SAM molecules and chemisorption&#8208;driven substrate anchoring. Herein, a rapid and controllable strategy for SAM assembly is presented, enabled by pre&#8208;adsorbed ionic bond mediators. The pre&#8208;anchored arginine (Arg) molecules on nickel oxid (NiOx) can weaken the amphiphilic nature of SAM molecules through ionic bond interaction, while also acting as steric barriers, thereby suppressing the self&#8208;aggregation of SAM molecules. This strategy is compatible with both spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating techniques, enabling rapid and controllable assembly of high&#8208;quality SAM of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) butyl] phosphonic acid. Moreover, the polar guanidinium tail of Arg passivates defects at the buried perovskite interface while strengthening interfacial coupling with the perovskite layer&#8211;enhancing both mechanical stability and electrical contact. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, the PSCs achieve high PCEs of up to 26.67% and 21.05% for small&#8208;area devices (active area: 0.049 cm2) and large&#8208;area modules (active area: 64.68 cm2), respectively. Notably, the devices exhibit exceptional operational stability, retaining 93% of their initial PCE after 1700 h of maximum power point tracking under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol.

         <title>Enabling Ultra&#8208;High Work Capacity and Scalable Processability of Liquid Crystal Actuators through Densely Entangled Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) with densely entangled structures are designed and synthesized. These entanglements significantly enhance the mechanical properties, resulting in an unprecedented work capacity during thermal actuation. The reversible nature of the entanglements makes the material easy to process, similar to conventional thermoplastic materials. This combination achieves both high work capacity and scalable processability for LCEs.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are important soft actuators that show strong promise in many fields where traditional rigid actuators or robotics are impractical. However, their real&#8208;world applications are lacking primarily due to inadequate actuation performance and complicated fabrication processes. Here, a novel design is reported that significantly enhances actuation performance while simplifying the fabrication process. The design involves constructing densely entangled structures by synthesizing high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight linear LCEs (&gt;180&#160;kDa) with a moderate number of side groups in a single step. These entangled structures greatly enhance mechanical strength while maintaining toughness, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high actuation work capacity (1427&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). By applying melt shearing or solvent treatment, these entanglements can be temporarily disrupted, providing thermoplastic&#8208;like processability. With these properties, lightweight wearable devices (&lt;10 g) capable of generating over 30&#160;N of contractile force are developed, which is sufficient to reversibly lift an adult male's arm. This work employs a single fabrication step to develop densely entangled LCEs with exceptional actuation performance and thermoplastic&#8208;like processability, signaling a bright future for their applications in rehabilitation devices, wearables, and beyond.

         <title>Thermal Phase Transition Electrolyte for High&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermal phase transition aqueous electrolyte incorporating a upper critical solution temperature (UCST)&#8208;type polymer undergoes adaptive phase transitions, forming dynamic hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks that suppress water mobility and evaporation, provide self&#8208;regulated thermal buffering under localized heating, and restructure Zn2+ solvation to lower water activity, thereby stabilizing the Zn/electrolyte interface and substantially prolonging the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
The operational stability of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs) under extreme temperatures is crucial for long&#8208;term energy storage, yet remains hindered by intensified water activity and thermodynamic instability that exacerbate zinc dendrite growth and parasitic reactions. While incorporation of high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point organic solvents has shown effectiveness for high&#8208;temperature operation by reducing water content and disrupting hydrogen&#8208;bonding networks, it compromises the intrinsic safety of aqueous electrolyte especially in high&#8208;temperature scenario. Here, a thermoresponsive electrolyte approach is reported leveraging phase transition of a synthesized polymer with upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which achieves temperature&#8208;adaptive electrochemical performance in AZMBs. By modulating polymer&#8208;water interactions and entropy&#8208;enthalpy balance, the engineered aqueous electrolyte undergoes reversible phase transformation above 40 &#176;C, forming a dynamically polymer&#8208;water network that essentially suppresses water reactivity. Consequently, the optimized Zn&#8211;Zn symmetric cells exhibit stable Zn plating/stripping for 450 h at 60 &#176;C and 210 h even under extreme 80 &#176;C conditions. High&#8208;loading Zn&#8211;I2 full batteries with enhanced cycling stability further validate practical viability of the thermal phase transition electrolyte at elevated temperature. This work establishes a polymer phase transition paradigm for developing temperature&#8208;resilient electrolytes, providing mechanistic insights into interfacial stabilization and advancing metal anode technologies for extreme&#8208;condition energy storage systems.

         <title>Engineering the Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite oxide family is demonstrated for the first time to enable efficient electricity generation from water evaporation, and the key role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the performance is discovered. Oxygen vacancies in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; can enhance surface charges and facilitate water dissociation, resulting in stronger water&#8208;solid interaction/more ions transport in capillary channels and ultimately boosting voltage output.








Abstract
The development of new suitable material systems is paramount for water evaporation&#8208;induced electricity generation associated with the energy harvesting technology. Herein, to the best of the knowledge, the first demonstration of perovskite oxides for efficient electricity generation from water evaporation is presented and discover the key role of oxygen vacancies in promoting the performance. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept example, the A&#8208;site&#8208;deficient La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; perovskite with abundant oxygen vacancies in a single generator can achieve an absolute value of output voltage up to &#8776;1.5&#160;V for 200&#160;h under ambient conditions and even up to &#8776;2.5&#160;V at specific conditions, about one order of magnitude higher than the stoichiometric LaFeO3 counterpart. Noticeably, a voltage reversal phenomenon during the evaporation process is observed due to the zeta potential inversion mediated by the surface functional hydroxyl groups on the perovskite films. Theoretical calculations and systematic experiments demonstrate that oxygen vacancies in La0.95FeO3&#8208;&#948; enable to enhance surface charges and facilitate water dissociation, leading to stronger water&#8208;solid interfacial interaction and more ion transport in capillary networks, ultimately boosting the voltage output. More importantly, it is found that the promoting effect of oxygen vacancy in water evaporation&#8208;induced electricity is universal and applicable for metal oxides with varied structures and compositions.

         <title>Regenerative Redox Cycling Enables Stable Tin Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 38, Issue 1, 2 January 2026. </description>
         <dc:description>
A regenerative redox cycling strategy is developed to enable continuous reduction of Sn4+ and dual&#8208;site defect passivation during device operation, thereby enhancing the long&#8208;term stability of tin perovskite devices. The optimized device achieved an efficiency of 15.15% and exhibited excellent long&#8208;term stability, maintaining 100% of its initial efficiency after 1100 h of simulated day&#8211;night cycling.








Abstract
Tin halide perovskites (THPs) suffer from low stability due to the easy oxidation of Sn (II). Although traditional reduction strategies effectively inhibit the oxidation of Sn (II), the gradual depletion of reducing agents during continuous device operation significantly weakens their antioxidative capacity, thereby limiting the long&#8208;term stability of the device. Herein, a regenerative redox cycling strategy utilizing 4&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (4&#8208;MBA) is proposed. Under operational conditions, UV irradiation enables 4&#8208;MBA regeneration, which concurrently drives continuous Sn (IV)&#8208;to&#8208;Sn (II) reduction and facilitates dual&#8208;site defect passivation, significantly enhancing device efficiency and stability. Ultimately, an excellent efficiency of 15.15% is achieved and maintained 100% of the initial efficiency for 1100 h in a simulated day&#8211;night cycle maximum power point tracking (MPPT) test. This work provides a sustainable reduction strategy that effectively addresses the long&#8208;term stability issue of tin perovskite photovoltaic cells.

The macro&#8208;experiences of aging are the result of an accumulation of micro&#8208;changes that occur over time.








Abstract
The disparity between the global increase in life expectancy and the steady decline in health outcomes with age has been a major driver for developing new ways to research aging. Although this current tools for studying aging outside of the human body&#8212;such as animal models and cells in a dish&#8212;have improved this fundamental understanding of the markers and key mechanisms underlying this process, several limitations remain. Animal models are poor biological representations of humans and have a weak track record of translating pre&#8208;clinical results into successful clinical applications. Similarly, current 2D cellular models do not recapitulate the dynamic 3D environment of human tissue. This gap between the need for accurate biological mimicry and the limitations of current aging models presents an exciting opportunity for the field of biofabrication. Over the past decade, the combination of biofabrication and advanced biomaterials has shown potential to engineer high&#8208;resolution features that change over time or respond to specific stimuli. In this perspective, the current state of in vitro aging models is reflected, identify the key features that new models must emulate, discuss the technologies available to meet these complex specifications, and consider some of the potential challenges facing the field.
