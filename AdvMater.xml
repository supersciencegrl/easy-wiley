         <title>Platelet pharmacytes for the hierarchical amplification of anti&#8208;tumor immunity in response to self&#8208;generated immune signals</title>

Abstract
Systemic immunosuppression mediated by tumor&#8208;derived exosomes is an important cause for the resistance of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Herein, self&#8208;adaptive platelet (PLT) pharmacytes were engineered to mediate cascaded delivery of exosome&#8208;inhibiting siRNA and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPDL1) towards synergized anti&#8208;tumor immunity. In the pharmacytes, polycationic nanocomplexes (NCs) assembled from Rab27 siRNA (siRab) and a membrane&#8208;penetrating polypeptide were encapsulated inside the open canalicular system of PLTs, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;responsive aPDL1 nanogels (NGs) were covalently backpacked on the PLT surface. Upon systemic administration, the pharmacytes enabled prolonged blood circulation and active accumulation to tumors, wherein PLTs were activated to liberate siRab NCs that efficiently transfected tumor cells, silenced Rab27a, and inhibited exosome secretion. The immunosuppression was thus relieved, leading to activation, proliferation, and tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells which triggered latent aPDL1 release. As such, the competitive aPDL1 exhaustion by PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing exosomes was minimized to sensitize ICB. Synergistically, siRab and aPDL1 induced strong anti&#8208;tumor immunological response and memory against syngeneic murine melanoma. This study reports a bio&#8208;inspired mechanism to resolve the blood circulation/cell internalization contradiction of polycationic siRNA delivery systems, and renders an enlightened approach for the spatiotemporal enhancement of anti&#8208;tumor immunity.

         <title>A Better Choice to Achieve High Volumetric Energy Density: Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Volumetric energy density is a critical but easily neglected index of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Compared with gravimetric energy density, the volumetric energy density (VED) of LMBs is much more sensitive to the anode/cathode (A/C) ratio due to the low density of lithium (Li) metal and the volume expansion of Li&#8208;metal anode owing to its pulverization during cycles. Anode&#8208;free LMBs (AF&#8208;LMBs) have high theoretical VED due to the absence of anode and high retention with relatively low cell expansion. Because Li plating highly depends on the mother substrate, Li plating on copper (Cu) substrates is more reversible and denser than that on Li substrates during cycling, which is beneficial for maintaining high volumetric capacity and efficient Li utilization. Therefore, considering that excess Li must be strictly limited to achieve competitive energy density, we recommend AF&#8208;LMBs (with bare Cu foil as the anode current collector) for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermalization Pathways of Excited Bulk and Surface States in the Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductor GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A large Rashba effect is essential for future applications in spintronics. Particularly attractive is the study and control of nonequilibrium properties in ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors. Here, time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission is utilized to access the ultrafast dynamics of bulk and surface transient Rashba states after femtosecond&#8208;optical excitation of GeTe. A complex thermalization pathway is observed, wherein three different timescales can be clearly distinguished: (i) intraband thermalization, (ii) interband equilibration and (iii) electronic cooling. These dynamics are found to exhibit an unconventional temperature dependence: while the cooling phase speeds up with increasing sample temperature, the opposite happens for the interband thermalization. It is demonstrated how, due to the Rashba effect, an interdependence of these timescales on the relative strength of both electron&#8208;electron (e&#8208;e) and electron&#8208;phonon (e&#8208;ph) interactions is responsible for the counter&#8208;intuitive temperature dependence, with spin&#8208;selection constrained interband e&#8208;e scatterings found both to dominate dynamics away from the immediate vicinity of the Fermi level, and to weaken with increasing temperature. These findings are supported by theoretical calculations within the Boltzmann approach explicitly showing the opposite behavior of all relevant e&#8208;e and e&#8208;ph scattering channels with temperature, thus confirming the microscopic mechanism of the experimental findings. The present results are important for future applications of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors and their excitations in ultrafast&#160;spintronics.

         <title>Adaptive self&#8208;organization of nanomaterials enables strain&#8208;insensitive resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics. However, the resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites highly depends on external strains, often deteriorating the performance of fabricated electronic devices. Here we present a material strategy for the highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites comprising metal nanomaterials of various dimensions and a viscoelastic block&#8208;copolymer matrix. The resistance of the nanocomposites can be well retained under skin deformations (&lt; 50% strains). We demonstrated that silver nanomaterials can self&#8208;organize inside the viscoelastic media in response to external strains when their surface is conjugated with 1&#8208;decanethiol. We found distinct self&#8208;organization behaviors associated with nanomaterial dimensions and strain conditions. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials can render the resistance of the nanocomposites insensitive to uniaxial or biaxial strains. As a result, the resistance can be maintained with a variance of &lt;&#160;1% during 1000 stretching cycles under uniaxial and biaxial strains of &lt;&#160;50% while a high conductivity of &#8764; 31,000 S/cm is achieved.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Crystallization Processes and Methods in Nanocrystals, Single Crystals and Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskite semiconductors with extraordinary optoelectronic properties have been fascinatedly studied. Halide perovskite nanocrystals, single crystals and thin films have been prepared for various fields, such as light emission, light detection and light harvesting. High performance device relies on high crystal quality determined by nucleation and crystal growth process. In this review, we give the fundamental understanding of crystallization process driven by supersaturation of the solution and summarize those methods for halide perovskite crystals. Supersaturation determines the proportion and the average Gibbs free energy changes for surface and volume molecular units involved in the spontaneous aggregations, which could be stable in the solution and induce homogeneous nucleation only when the solution exceeds a required minimum critical concentration (Cmin). Crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation are thermodynamically easier than homogeneous nucleation due to the existent surfaces. Nanocrystals are mainly prepared via the nucleation&#8208;dominated process by rapidly increasing the concentration over Cmin, single crystals are mainly prepared via the growth&#8208;dominated process by keeping the concentration between solubility and Cmin, while thin films are mainly prepared by compromising the nucleation and growth processes to ensure compactness and grain sizes. Typical strategies for preparing these three forms of halide perovskites are also reviewed.

         <title>Spatial distribution control of antimicrobial peptides through a novel polymeric carrier for safe and efficient cancer treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potential for use in tumor treatment. However, developing AMP&#8208;based antitumor therapies is challenging due to circulatory instability, hemolytic toxicity, low selectivity, and poor cell permeability of AMPs. In this study, we present a polymeric carrier for AMPs (denoted as PAMPm&#8208;co&#8208;PPBEn/PCA) that effectively enhances their anti&#8208;cancer efficacy while minimizing their potential side effects. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability. Upon employing KLA as the model AMP, the polymeric carrier suppressed its hemolytic toxicity during blood circulation, facilitated its cellular internalization as reaching tumor tissues, and restored and further enhanced its membranolytic toxicity towards the mitochondria upon entering cancer cells. Animal studies have indicated that this approach significantly improved the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of KLA and reduced its toxicity. Considering that the loading method for most AMPs is identical to that of KLA, the polymeric carrier reported in this study may provide a feasible approach for the development of AMP&#8208;based cancer treatments.

         <title>Intelligent Micro/nanorobot for Cancer Theragnostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer is one of the most intractable diseases owing to its high mortality rate and lack of effective diagnostic and treatment tools. Advancements in micro/nanorobot (MNR)&#8208;assisted sensing, imaging, and therapeutics offer unprecedented opportunities to develop MNR&#8208;based cancer theragnostic platforms. Unlike ordinary nanoparticles which exhibit Brownian motion in biofluids, MNRs overcome viscous resistance in an ultralow Reynolds number (Re&lt;&lt;1) environment by effective self&#8208;propulsion. This unique locomotion property has motivated the advanced design and functionalization of MNRs as a basis for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy platforms, which offer the potential for precise distribution and improved permeation of therapeutic agents. Enhanced barrier penetration, imaging&#8208;guided operation, and biosensing have additionally been studied to enable the promising cancer&#8208;related applications of MNRs. This review comprehensively addresses recent advances in MNR&#8208;based cancer therapy, including in actuation engines, diagnostics, medical imaging, and targeted drug delivery; we highlight promising research opportunities that could have a profound impact on cancer therapy over the next decade.

The distinct advantages of AM facilitate the rapid development of PAEK products with complex customized structures and functionalities, thereby enhancing their applications in various fields. Herein, a comprehensive review of the recent advances on AM of high&#8208;performance PAEKs is provided, concerning the materials properties, AM processes, mechanical properties, and potential applications of additively manufactured PAEKs. It begins with the introduction of fundamentals of AM and PAEKs, as well as the advantages of AM of PAEKs. Discussions are then presented on the material properties, AM processes, processing&#8211;matter coupling mechanism, thermal conductivity, crystallization characteristics, and microstructures of AM processed PAEKs. Thereafter, the mechanical properties and anisotropy of additively manufactured PAEKs are discussed in depth. Their representative applications in biomedical, aerospace, electronics, and other fields are systematically presented.

         <title>A Multifunctional Photoacoustic/Fluorescence Dual&#8208;Mode&#8208;Imaging Gold&#8208;Based Theranostic Nanoformulation without External Laser Limitations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
mdGC as a multifunctional photoacoustic/fluorescence dual&#8208;mode imaging theranostic nanoformulation shows good diagnosis and treatment performance without external laser limitations through the mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptotic pathway by increasing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulating the expression of apoptosis&#8208;related genes.








Abstract
Theranostics is a new type of biomedical technology that organically combines the diagnosis and therapy of diseases. Among molecular imaging techniques, the integration of photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence (FL) imaging modes with high sensitivity and imaging depth provides precise diagnostic outcomes. Gold nanorods (Au NRs) are well&#8208;known contrast agents for PA imaging and photothermal therapy. However, their high toxicity, poor biocompatibility, rapid clearance, and the need for an external laser source limit their application. Therefore, modification of Au NRs with carbon&#8208;based nanomaterials (CBNs) is done to obtain a multifunctional dual&#8208;mode gold&#8208;based nanoformulation (mdGC), which preforms dual&#8208;mode imaging of PA and FL. The results show that mdGC promotes tumor cell apoptosis and exhibits good antitumor performance through the mitochondria&#8208;mediated apoptotic pathway by increasing the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species, reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulating the expression of apoptosis&#8208;related genes. The targeting rate of mdGC to tumor tissue is up to 20.71 &#177; 1.94%&#160;ID g&#8208;1; the tumor growth inhibition rate is as high as 80.44% without external laser sources. In general, mdGC is a potential multifunctional diagnostic and therapy integrated nanoformulation.

         <title>Delivering mechanical stimulation to cells: state of the art in materials and devices design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If we assume the biochemical signals to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is a growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state of the art in design and development of such materials and devices, with a focus on their design principles, and highlight challenges and perspectives for future research directions.

         <title>Emerging Biosensing Technologies for the Diagnostics of Viral Infectious Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biosensors successfully assist differentiative diagnosis and screening of viral pathogens and related biomarkers for facilitating the pandemic management worldwide. This review sheds light upon various biosensing technologies mainly from a material perspective by evaluating their analytical performance and suitability for point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. Moreover, current challenges, opportunities, and future trends of biosensors regarding on&#8208;site management of next pandemics are discussed.








Abstract
Several viral infectious diseases appear limitless since the beginning of the 21st century, expanding into pandemic lengths. Thus, there are extensive efforts to provide more efficient means of diagnosis, a better understanding of acquired immunity, and improved monitoring of inflammatory biomarkers, as these are all crucial for controlling the spread of infection while aiding in vaccine development and improving patient outcomes. In this regard, various biosensors have been developed recently to streamline pathogen and immune response detection by addressing the limitations of traditional methods, including isothermal amplification&#8208;based systems and lateral flow assays. This review explores state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biosensors for detecting viral pathogens, serological assays, and inflammatory biomarkers from the material perspective, by discussing their advantages, limitations, and further potential regarding their analytical performance, clinical utility, and point&#8208;of&#8208;care adaptability. Additionally, next&#8208;generation biosensing technologies that offer better sensitivity and selectivity, and easy handling for end&#8208;users are highlighted. An emerging example of these next&#8208;generation biosensors are those powered by novel synthetic biology tools, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with CRISPR&#8208;associated proteins (Cas), in combination with integrated point&#8208;of&#8208;care devices. Lastly, the current challenges are discussed and a roadmap for furthering these advanced biosensing technologies to manage future pandemics is provided.

         <title>Pre&#8208;buried Additive for Cross&#8208;Layer Modification in Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 22%</title>

Abstract
Halide perovskites have shown superior potentials in flexible photovoltaics due to their soft and high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight nature. However, interfacial residual stress and lattice mismatch due to the large deformation of flexible substrates have greatly limited the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Here, ammonium formate (HCOONH4) is used as a pre&#8208;buried additive in electron transport layer (ETL) to realize a bottom&#8208;up infiltration process for an in&#8208;situ, integral modification of ETL, perovskite layer and their interface. The HCOONH4 treatment leads to an enhanced electron extraction in ETL, relaxed residual strain and micro&#8208;strain in perovskite film, along with reduced defect densities within these layers. As a result, we achieve a top power conversion efficiency of 22.37% and a certified 21.9% on F&#8208;PSCs, representing the highest performance reported so far. This work links the critical connection between multilayer mechanics/defect profiles of ETL&#8208;perovskite structure and device performance, thus providing meaningful scientific direction to further narrowing the efficiency gap between F&#8208;PSCs and rigid&#8208;substrate counterparts.

         <title>Thermally Drawn Highly Conductive Fibers with Controlled Elasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elasticity is introduced in thermally drawn fibers by modifying the pathway of metallic electrodes to either a buckled or helical configuration. The electrodes maintain minimal change in resistance within the elastic strain regime defined by geometric and material properties. Integration of light&#8208;emitting diodes connected by stretchable electrodes within fibers yields stretchable and conformable fabric optical antennas for high&#8208;bandwidth data transmission.








Abstract
Electronic fabrics necessitate both electrical conductivity and, like any textile, elastic recovery. Achieving both requirements on the scale of a single fiber remains an unmet need. Here, two approaches for achieving conductive fibers (107 S m&#8722;1) reaching 50% elongation while maintaining minimal change in resistance (&lt;0.5%) in embedded metallic electrodes are introduced. The first approach involves inducing a buckling instability in a metal microwire within a cavity of a thermally drawn elastomer fiber. The second approach relies on twisting an elastomer fiber to yield helical metal electrodes embedded in a stretchable yarn. The scalability of both approaches is illustrated in apparatuses for continuous buckling and twisting that yield tens of meters of elastic conducting fibers. Through experimental and analytical methods, it is elucidated how geometric parameters, such as buckling pre&#8208;strain and helical angle, as well as materials choice, control not only the fiber's elasticity but also its Young's modulus. Links between mechanical and electrical properties are exposed. The resulting fibers are used to construct elastic fabrics that contain diodes, by weaving and knitting, thus demonstrating the scalable fabrication of conformable and stretchable antennas that support optical data transmission.

         <title>Confined Growth of Silver&#8211;Copper Janus Nanostructures with {100} Facets for Highly Selective Tandem Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through breaking the common symmetric growth, three kinds of silver&#8208;copper Janus nanostructures with {100} facets are synthesized with a wet&#8208;chemical method. Coupling the tandem catalysis, copper {100} facets, and electron transfer between silver and copper, the obtained Janus nanostructures demonstrate excellent Faradaic efficiency toward both ethylene and multicarbon products in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds significant potential to promote carbon neutrality. However, the selectivity toward multicarbon products in CO2RR is still too low to meet practical applications. Here the authors report the delicate synthesis of three kinds of Ag&#8211;Cu Janus nanostructures with {100} facets (JNS&#8208;100) for highly selective tandem electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to multicarbon products. By controlling the surfactant and reduction kinetics of Cu precursor, the confined growth of Cu with {100} facets on one of the six equal faces of Ag nanocubes is realized. Compared with Cu nanocubes, Ag65&#8211;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 demonstrates much superior selectivity for both ethylene and multicarbon products in CO2RR at less negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the compensating electronic structure and carbon monoxide spillover in Ag65&#8211;Cu35 JNS&#8208;100 contribute to the enhanced CO2RR performance. This study provides an effective strategy to design advanced tandem catalysts toward the extensive application of CO2RR.

         <title>Construction of Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conducting Scaffolds in Zn Powder: A Scalable Route to Dendrite&#8208;Free and Flexible Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor scaffold was introduced into Zn powder to successfully fabricate anti&#8208;corrosive, flexible, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes by using a scalable tape&#8208;casting strategy.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are considered ideal candidates for Zn&#8208;based batteries because they enable a positive synergistic integration of safety and energy density. However, Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes still experience easy corrosion, uncontrolled dendrite growth, and poor mechanical strength, which restrict their further application. Herein, a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting scaffold is introduced into Zn&#8208;P to successfully fabricate anti&#8208;corrosive, flexible, and dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes using a scalable tape&#8208;casting strategy. The as&#8208;established scaffold is characterized by robust flexibility, facile scale&#8208;up synthesis methodology, and exceptional anti&#8208;corrosive characteristics, and it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux during Zn plating/stripping, thus allowing stable Zn cycling. Benefiting from these comprehensive attributes, the as&#8208;prepared Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anode provides superior electrochemical performance, including long&#8208;life cycling stability and high rate capability in practical coin and flexible pouch cells; thus, it holds great potential for developing advanced Zn&#8208;ion batteries. The findings of this study provide insights for a promising scalable pathway to fabricate highly efficient and reliable Zn&#8208;based anodes and will aid in the realization of advanced flexible energy&#8208;storage devices.

The findings of this study provide insights for a promising scalable pathway to fabricate highly efficient and reliable Zn-based anodes and will aid in the realization of advanced flexible energy-storage devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Biomaterial&#8208;Based Hedging Immune Strategy for Scarless Tendon Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrospun&#8208;fiber&#8208;tethered scarring subpopulation membranes are fabricated to shift type I biased polarization, alleviate stress, and mitigate inflammatory depression. Wrapping Him&#8208;MFM alleviates pathological responses, protects tenocytes in situ, and restores hierarchically arranged collagen fibers covered by a basement membrane, structurally and functionally similar to mature tendons, demonstrating a promising strategy to yield regeneration.








Abstract
Scarring rather than regeneration, is an inevitable outcome of unbalanced amplifications of inflammation&#8208;destructive signals and atresia of the regenerative niche. However, identifying and effectively hedging against the risk of scarring and realizing the conversion of regenerative cues remain difficult. In this work, a hedging immune strategy based microfibrous membrane (Him&#8208;MFM), by tethering distearoyl phosphoethanolamine layer&#8208;supported copoly(lactic/glycolic acid) electrospun fibers with identified CD11b+/CD68+ scarring subpopulation membranes in the immune landscape after tendon injury to counterweigh tissue damage, is reported. Him&#8208;MFM, carrying relevant risk receptors is shown to shift high type I biased polarization, alleviate apoptosis and metabolic stress, and mitigate inflammatory tenocyte response. Remarkably, the hedging immune strategy reverses the damaged tendon sheath barrier to the innate IL&#8208;33 secretory phenotype by 4.36 times and initiates the mucous&#8208;IL&#8208;33&#8208;Th2 axis, directly supplying a transient but obligate regenerative niche for sheath stem cell proliferation. In murine flexor tendon injury, the wrapping of Him&#8208;MFM alleviates pathological responses, protects tenocytes in situ, and restores hierarchically arranged collagen fibers covered with basement membrane, and is structurally and functionally comparable to mature tendons, demonstrating that the hedging immunity is a promising strategy to yield regenerative responses not scarring.

         <title>More than Carbazole Derivatives Activate Room Temperature Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence of Benzoindole Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four carbazole/1H&#8208;benzo[f]indole (Cz/Bd) derivatives are synthesized to give a general mechanism of Bd&#8208;based ultralong organic phosphorescence. When Bd derivatives were&#160;dispersed into the matrixes, their strong ultralong phosphorescence was&#160;activated and it originated from the radical cations. The photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence may open a simple way for high&#8208;resolution photolithography, which is promising in the technology of encryption.








Abstract
The mechanism of carbazole (Cz)&#8208;based phosphors is still unclear since its isomer (1H&#8208;benzo[f]indole, Bd) is discovered in 2020. Herein, the successful synthesis of four Cz/Bd derivatives is reported, named as 2CzBr, CzBdBr, 2BdBr, and 3Bd, and the general mechanism for their ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) is provided. Bd and its derivatives give double groups of phosphorescence, including the short&#8208;wavelength phosphorescence with a short lifetime and the ultralong phosphorescence at long wavelengths, assigned to their neutral molecules and radical cations, respectively. Interestingly, the doped poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films of CzBdBr and 2BdBr show photo&#8208;activated ultralong phosphorescence at room temperature. The activation of Bd derivatives &#8216;UOP involves three factors: 1) well dispersion in the matrix with limited amount, 2) generation of their radical cations and 3) the matrix&#8208;mediated stabilization of radical cations. The function of Cz derivatives to activate the Bd derivatives&#8217; UOP could be replaced by photo&#8208;activation or using other matrixes. Significantly, the application of the doped PMMA films is practiced and gives an exciting result that the high&#8208;resolution QR code could be reversibly printed and erased on the film. This research has expanded the understanding in the field of organic phosphorescence and it may pave a new way for its development.

         <title>Regulation of Surface Defect Chemistry toward Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Particle surface instability induces severe electrochemical degradations in Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials, especially when the battery operates at high voltage. This study illustrates a strategy for simultaneously regulating surface defect chemistry and surface structure, leading to a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties. These findings provide a facile way to surface engineering to achieve stable cathodes in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Surface reconstruction of Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (NLO) degrades the cycling stability and safety of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which challenges typical surface&#8208;modification approaches to build a robust interface with electrochemical activity. Here, a strategy of leveraging the low&#8208;strain analogues of Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMR) to reconstruct a stable surface on the Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is proposed. The new surface structure not only consists of a gradient chemical composition but also contains a defect&#8208;rich structure regarding the formation of oxygen vacancies and cationic ordering, which can simultaneously facilitate lithium diffusion and stabilize the crystal structure during the (de)lithiation. These features in the NLO lead to a dramatic improvement in electrochemical properties, especially the cyclability under high voltage cycling, exhibiting the 30% increase in capacity retention after 200 cycles at the current density of 1&#160;C (3.0&#8211;4.6&#160;V). The findings offer a facile and effective way to regulate defect chemistry and surface structure in parallel on Ni&#8208;rich layered structure cathodes to achieve high&#8208;energy density LIBs.

         <dc:description>
Ultrafast (&#8776;42&#160;ns) and nonvolatile multilevel analog storage with long retention, robust endurance, high on/off ratio (105), and excellent reliability is developed using proximity&#8208;oxidation&#8208;grown TiO2 layers. Fundamental NOT, AND, and OR operations with reconfigurable logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory processing are constructed using proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ReTFTs. On&#8208;demand signal memory&#8208;processing operations like multi&#8208;terminal addressable memory, learning, and pattern recognition/classification are developed for neuromorphic hardware.








Abstract
The pursuit of a universal device that combines nonvolatile multilevel storage, ultrafast writing/erasing speed, nondestructive readout, and embedded processing with low power consumption demands the development of innovative architectures. Although thin&#8208;film transistors and redox&#8208;based resistive&#8208;switching devices have independently been proven to be ideal building blocks for data processing and storage, it is still difficult to achieve both well&#8208;controlled multilevel memory and high&#8208;precision ultrafast processing in a single unit, even though this is essential for the large&#8208;scale hardware implementation of in&#8208;memory computing. In this work, an ultrafast (&#8776;42&#160;ns) and programable redox thin&#8208;film transistor (ReTFT) memory made of a proximity&#8208;oxidation&#8208;grown TiO2 layer is developed, which has on/off ratio of 105, nonvolatile multilevel analog storage with a long retention time, strong durability, and high reliability. Utilizing the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ReTFTs, circuits capable of performing fundamental NOT, AND, and OR operations with reconfigurable logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory processing are developed. Further, on&#8208;demand signal memory&#8208;processing operations, like multi&#8208;terminal addressable memory, learning, pattern recognition, and classification, are explored for prospective application in neuromorphic hardware. This device, which operates on a fundamentally different mechanism, presents an alternate solution to the problems associated with the creation of high&#8208;performing in&#8208;memory processing technology.

The novel paper is fabricated from renewable plant pollen quickly and straightforwardly with less energy consumption and shows excellent printability, readability, and pH&#8208;triggered ability of toner erasability. Repeated reprinting and recycling are demonstrated due to their stable hydroswelling property.








Abstract
Although paperless technologies are becoming ubiquitous, paper and paper&#8208;based materials remain one of the most widely used resources, predicted to exceed an annual total of 460 million metric tons by 2030. Given the environmental challenges, deleterious impact on natural resources, and waste associated with conventional wood&#8208;based paper manufacturing, developing more sustainable strategies to source, produce, and recycle paper from natural materials is essential. Here, the development and production of reusable and recyclable paper are reported. This approach offers a pathway for easily producing natural pollen grains via ecofriendly, economical, scalable, and low&#8208;energy fabrication routes. It is demonstrated that the pollen&#8208;based paper exhibits high&#8208;quality printability, readability, and erasability, enabling its reuse. Based on the pH&#8208;responsive morphological responses of engineered pollen materials, a method for hygro stable printing and on&#8208;demand unprinting is presented. The reusability of the pollen paper renders it more advantageous than conventional single&#8208;print wood&#8208;based paper. This study thus provides possible pathways to utilize non&#8208;allergenic pollen, which is renewable and naturally abundant, as a sustainable source of reusable paper. While this work primarily deals with paper, the methods described here can be extended to produce other products such as cartons and containers for the storage and transport of liquid and solid materials.

         <title>Electronic Structure Engineering of Single&#8208;Atom Ru Sites via Co&#8208;N4 Sites for Bifunctional pH&#8208;universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of bifunctional water&#8208;splitting electrocatalysts that are efficient and stable over a wide range of pH is of great significance but challenging. Here, we report an atomically dispersed Ru/Co dual&#8208;sites catalyst anchored on N&#8208;doped carbon (Ru/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C) for outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. The Ru/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst requires the overpotential of only 13 and 23&#160;mV for HER, 232 and 247&#160;mV for OER to deliver a current density of 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8211;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1 M KOH, respectively, outperforming benchmark catalysts Pt/C and RuO2. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Co&#8208;N4 sites into Ru/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C efficiently modify the electronic structure of Ru by enlarging Ru&#8208;O covalency and increasing Ru electron density, which in turn optimize the bonding strength between oxygen/hydrogen intermediate species with Ru sites, thereby enhancing OER and HER performance. Furthermore, the incorporation of Co&#8208;N4 sites induces electron redistribution around Ru&#8208;N4, thus enhancing corrosion&#8208;resistance of Ru/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C during acid and alkaline electrolysis. The Ru/Co&#8208;N&#8208;C has been applied in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyser and demonstrated steady operation at a high current density of 450&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 for 330 h.

         <title>Ceramic&#8208;Electrolyte Glucose Fuel Cell for Implantable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Next&#8208;generation implantable devices such as sensors, drug delivery systems, and electroceuticals require efficient, reliable, and highly miniaturized power sources. Existing power sources such as the Li&#8211;I2 pacemaker battery exhibit limited scale&#8208;down potential without sacrificing capacity, and therefore, alternatives are needed to power miniaturized implants. In this work, we show that ceramic electrolytes can be employed in potentially implantable glucose fuel cells with unprecedented miniaturization. Specifically, we demonstrate a ceramic glucose fuel cell &#8211; based on the proton&#8208;conducting electrolyte ceria &#8211; that is composed of a free&#8208;standing membrane of thickness below 400&#160;nm and fully integrated into silicon for easy integration into bioelectronics. In contrast to polymeric membranes, all materials used are highly temperature stable, making thermal sterilization for implantation trivial. We demonstrate a peak power density of 43 &#956;W cm&#8722;2, and an unusually high statistical verification of successful fabrication and electrochemical function across 150 devices for open&#8208;circuit voltage and 12 devices for power density, enabled by a specifically designed testing apparatus and protocol. Our findings demonstrate that ceramic&#8208;based micro glucose fuel cells constitute the smallest potentially implantable power sources to date and are viable options to power the next generation of highly miniaturized implantable medical devices.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Integrated Soft Thermoelectrics for Shape Memory Actuation and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) have attracted tremendous interest as actuators for soft robotics due to their mechanical and shape memory properties. However, LCE actuators typically respond to thermal stimulation through active joule heating and passive cooling, which make them difficult to control. In this paper, we combine LCE with soft, stretchable thermoelectrics to create transducers capable of electrically controlled actuation, active cooling, and thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. The thermoelectric layers are composed of semiconductors embedded within a 3D printed elastomer matrix and wired together with eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects. This layer is covered on both sides with LCE, which alternately heat and cool to achieve cyclical bending actuation in response to voltage&#8208;controlled Peltier activation. Moreover, the thermoelectric layer can harvest energy from thermal gradients between the two LCE layers through the Seebeck effect, allowing for regenerative energy harvesting. As demonstrations, first, closed&#8208;loop control of the transducer is performed to rapidly track a changing actuator position. Second, we introduce a soft robotic walker that is capable of walking towards a heat source and harvesting energy. Lastly, we show phototropic&#8208;inspired autonomous deflection of the limbs towards a heat source, demonstrating an additional method to increase energy recuperation efficiency for soft systems.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Scale Approach for Modeling the Optical Response of Molecular Materials Inside Cavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recent fabrication advances in nanoscience and molecular materials point towards a new era where material properties are tailored in silico for target applications. To fully realize this potential, accurate and computationally efficient theoretical models are needed for (a) the computer&#8208;aided design and optimization of new materials before their fabrication, and (b) the accurate interpretation of experiments. The development of such theoretical models is a challenging multi&#8208;disciplinary problem where physics, chemistry, and material science are intertwined across spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the device level, that is, from &#229;ngstr&#246;ms to millimeters. In photonic applications, molecular materials are often placed inside optical cavities. Together with the sought&#8208;after enhancement of light&#8208;molecule interactions, the cavities bring additional complexity to the modeling of such devices. Here, we&#160;present a multi&#8208;scale approach that, starting from ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations, can compute the electromagnetic response of macroscopic devices such as cavities containing molecular materials. We&#160;combine molecular TD&#8208;DFT calculations with the efficient T&#8208;matrix&#8208;based solution of Maxwell's equations. We&#160;demonstrate some of the capabilities of the approach by simulating SURMOF&#8208;in&#8208;cavity and J&#8208;aggregates&#8208;in&#8208;cavity systems that have been recently investigated experimentally, and providing a refined understanding of the experimental results.

         <title>Photoinduced Multi&#8208;Bit Nonvolatile Memory Based on a van der Waals Heterostructure with a 2D&#8208;Perovskite Floating Gate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D perovskite is applied as a charge&#8208;trapping and photosensitive layer in floating&#8208;gate non&#8208;volatile optoelectronic memory, demonstrating superior performance and multi&#8208;bit negative photoconductivity (NPC)/positive photoconductivity (PPC) behavior with low optical switching power.








Abstract
The development of floating&#8208;gate nonvolatile memory (FGNVM) is limited by the charge storage, retention and transfer ability of the charge&#8208;trapping layer. Here, it is demonstrated that due to the unique alternate inorganic/organic chain structure and superior optical sensitivity, an insulating 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D&#8208;RPP) layer can function both as an excellent charge&#8208;storage layer and a photosensitive layer. Optoelectronic memory composed of a MoS2/hBN/2D&#8208;RPP (MBR) van der Waals heterostructure is demonstrated. The MBR device exhibits unique light&#8208;controlled charge&#8208;storage characteristics, with maximum memory window up to 92&#160;V, high on/off ratio of 104, negligible degeneration over 103&#160;s, &gt;1000 program/erase cycles, and write speed of 500&#160;&#181;s. Dependent on the initial states, the MBR optoelectronic memory can be programmed in both positive photoconductivity (PPC) and negative photoconductivity (NPC) modes, with up to 11 and 22 distinct resistance states, respectively. The optical program power for each bit is as low as 36/10&#160;pJ for PPC/NPC. The results not only reveal the potential of 2D&#8208;RPP as a superior charge&#8208;storage medium in floating&#8208;gate memory, but also provides an effective strategy toward fast, low&#8208;power and stable optical multi&#8208;bit storage and neuromorphic computing.

&lt;p&gt;2D perovskite is applied as a charge-trapping and photosensitive layer in floating-gate non-volatile optoelectronic memory, demonstrating superior performance and multi-bit negative photoconductivity (NPC)/positive photoconductivity (PPC) behavior with low optical switching power.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of floating-gate nonvolatile memory (FGNVM) is limited by the charge storage, retention and transfer ability of the charge-trapping layer. Here, it is demonstrated that due to the unique alternate inorganic/organic chain structure and superior optical sensitivity, an insulating 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite (2D-RPP) layer can function both as an excellent charge-storage layer and a photosensitive layer.

         <title>Chemical Passivation Stabilizes Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical passivation of Zn surface is achieved by a simple treatment in a solution of strong oxidant such as KMnO4, which drastically improves its electrochemical cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries are an attractive option for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, which is vital to the integration of renewable energy resources with the electric energy infrastructure. The cycling stability of aqueous ZIBs is determined by the electrochemical reversibility of Zn anode, which is often deteriorated by its corrosion and dendritic Zn deposition. Here, a simple and rapid surface passivation strategy that can drastically improve the cycling stability of Zn anodes is demonstrated. For example, a dip in KMnO4 solution readily forms a continuous, conformal, and robust protective layer on the native Zn surface, leading to a more uniform plating/stripping process, increased corrosion resistance, and tolerance to manufacturing and processing defects on Zn metal electrodes. The Zn electrode cycling stabilities at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2 are extended by &#8776;40 times. In full battery tests in the configuration of Zn||&#946;&#8208;MnO2, the full cell with passivated Zn anode exhibited a capacity retention of 68.7% after 300 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g&#8722;1, while the cell with untreated Zn anode can only retain 7.4% of capacity under the same conditions.

         <title>Fermi&#8208;Level Pinning&#8208;Free WSe2 Transistors via 2D Van der Waals Metal Contacts and Their Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A creation of clean van der Waals contacts is reported. Clean contacts made from 2D metal Cl&#8211;SnSe2 can completely eliminate the Femi&#8208;level pinning, permitting ideal Schottky barrier heights and polarity&#8208;controllable transistors. With the ability to control the carrier polarity, various functional logic gates and circuits (inverter, NAND, and NOR) are demonstrated by integrating WSe2 transistors with Cl&#8211;SnSe2 contacts.








Abstract
Precise control over the polarity of transistors is a key necessity for the construction of complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits. However, the polarity control of 2D transistors remains a challenge because of the lack of a high&#8208;work&#8208;function electrode that completely eliminates Fermi&#8208;level pinning at metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces. Here, a creation of clean van der Waals contacts is demonstrated, wherein a metallic 2D material, chlorine&#8208;doped SnSe2 (Cl&#8211;SnSe2), is used as the high&#8208;work&#8208;function contact, providing an interface that is free of defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning. Such clean contacts made from Cl&#8211;SnSe2 can pose nearly ideal Schottky barrier heights, following the Schottky&#8211;Mott limit and thus permitting polarity&#8208;controllable transistors. With the integration of Cl&#8211;SnSe2 as contacts, WSe2 transistors exhibit pronounced p&#8208;type characteristics, which are distinctly different from those of the devices with evaporated metal contacts, where n&#8208;type transport is observed. Finally, this ability to control the polarity enables the fabrication of functional logic gates and circuits, including inverter, NAND, and NOR.

         <title>Ligand Modulation of Active Sites to Promote Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand modulated electronic structure, the (Fe,Co)OOH/MI reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O 2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI&#8208;modulated catalyst demonstrates ultralow overpotential (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2), and robust stability (&gt;155&#160;h).








Abstract
Rationally designed catalysts hold the key to address the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, engineering the active sites of such catalysts still faces grand challenges. This study proposes a feasible ligand modulation strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of cobalt&#8208;iron oxyhydroxide ((Fe,Co)OOH). The 2&#8208;methylimidazole (MI) ligand coordination on (Fe,Co)OOH reduces the orbital overlap between the Fe/Co 3d and O&#160;2p, which weakens the adsorption to oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and thus facilitates the unfavorable O2 desorption. As a result, the MI ligand modulated (Fe,Co)OOH achieves an excellent OER performance with low overpotentials (230/290&#160;mV at 10/100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2) and excellent durability (&gt;155&#160;h). This study provides a novel ligand modulation strategy for the design of OER catalysts.

         <title>Large Transverse and Longitudinal Magneto&#8208;Thermoelectric Effect in Polycrystalline Nodal&#8208;Line Semimetal Mg3Bi2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological semimetals provide new opportunities for exploring novel thermoelectric phenomena, owing to their exotic and nontrivial electronic structure topology around the Fermi surface. Herein, large magneto&#8208;thermoelectric and magnetoresistance effects in polycrystalline type&#8208;II nodal&#8208;line topological semimetal Mg3Bi2 through a defect engineering method are revealed.








Abstract
Topological semimetals provide new opportunities for exploring novel thermoelectric phenomena, owing to their exotic and nontrivial electronic structure topology around the Fermi surface. Herein, the discovery of large transverse and longitudinal magneto&#8208;thermoelectric (MTE) effects in Mg3Bi2 is reported and predicted to be a type&#8208;II nodal&#8208;line semimetal in the absence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). The maximum transverse power factor is 2182 &#956;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2 at 13.5 K and 6 Tesla. The longitudinal power factor reaches up to 3043 &#956;W m&#8722;1K&#8722;2, which is 20 times higher than that in a zero&#8208;strength magnetic field and is also comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MTE materials. By compensating the Mg loss in Mg&#8208;rich conditions for tuning the carrier concentration close to intrinsic state, the sample fabricated in this study exhibits a large linear non&#8208;saturating magnetoresistance of 940% under a field of 14 Tesla. Using density functional calculations, the authors attribute the underlying mechanism to the parent linear&#8208;dispersed nodal&#8208;line electronic structure without SOC and the anisotropic Fermi surface shape with SOC, highlighting the essential role of high carrier mobility and open electron orbits in the moment space. This work offers a new avenue toward highly efficient MTE materials through defect engineering in polycrystalline topological semimetals.

Using density functional calculations, the authors attribute the underlying mechanism to the parent linear-dispersed nodal-line electronic structure without SOC and the anisotropic Fermi surface shape with SOC, highlighting the essential role of high carrier mobility and open electron orbits in the moment space. This work offers a new avenue toward highly efficient MTE materials through defect engineering in polycrystalline topological semimetals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Activating a Semiconductor&#8211;Liquid Junction via Laser&#8208;Derived Dual Interfacial Layers for Boosted Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual interfacial layers, composed of a top covalent anchored carbon dots layer and a Mo:BiVO4 shallow layer with enriched oxygen vacancies, are constructed to synchronously boost charge&#8208;carrier kinetics and inhibit photocorrosion, which results in a BiVO4 photoanode with a photocurrent density of 6.08&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and operational stability up to 120 h at 1.23 VRHE.








Abstract
The semiconductor&#8211;liquid junction (SCLJ), the dominant place in photoelectrochemical (PEC) catalysis, determines the interfacial activity and stability of photoelectrodes, whcih directly affects the viability of PEC hydrogen generation. Though efforts dedicated in past decades, a challenge remains regarding creating a synchronously active and stable SCLJ, owing to the technical hurdles of simultaneously overlaying the two advantages. The present work demonstrates that creating an SCLJ with a unique configuration of the dual interfacial layers can yield BiVO4 photoanodes with synchronously boosted photoelectrochemical activity and operational stability, with values located at the top in the records of such photoelectrodes. The bespoke dual interfacial layers, accessed via grafting laser&#8208;generated carbon dots with phenolic hydroxyl groups (LGCDs&#8208;PHGs), are experimentally verified effective, not only in generating the uniform layer of LGCDs with covalent anchoring for inhibited photocorrosion, but also in activating, respectively, the charge separation and transfer in each layer for boosted charge&#8208;carrier kinetics, resulting in FeNiOOH&#8211;LGCDs&#8208;PHGs&#8211;MBVO photoanodes with a dual configuration with the photocurrent density of 6.08 mA cm&#8722;2 @ 1.23 VRHE, and operational stability up to 120 h @ 1.23 VRHE. Further work exploring LGCDs&#8208;PHGs from catecholic molecules warrants the proposed strategy as being a universal alternative for addressing the interfacial charge&#8208;carrier kinetics and operational stability of semiconductor photoelectrodes.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Encoding Free&#8208;Standing RNA Hydrogel for Sub&#8208;Compartmentalized Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and robust RNA hydrogel is developed as a result of rolling circle transcription possessing RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes. Selective catalytic activity and enhanced production of proteins in a sub&#8208;compartmentalized system are observed. This innovative gel technology will expand the current realm of RNA research and create an impact on the RNA principles and applications from the bench to the clinic.








Abstract
RNA can self&#8208;fold into complex structures that can serve as major biological regulators in protein synthesis and in catalysis. Due to the abundance of structural primitives and functional diversity, RNA has been utilized for designing nature&#8208;defined goals despite its intrinsic chemical instability and lack of technologies. Here, a robust, free&#8208;standing RNA hydrogel is developed through a sequential process involving both ligation and rolling circle transcription to form RNA G&#8208;quadruplexes, capable of both catalytic activity and enhancing expression of several proteins in sub&#8208;compartmentalized, phase&#8208;separated translation environments. The observations suggest that this hydrogel will expand RNA research and impact practical RNA principles and applications.

         <title>Engineering High Strength and Super&#8208;Toughness of Unfolded Structural Proteins and their Extraordinary Anti&#8208;Adhesion Performance for Abdominal Hernia Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of biological fibers with a combination of high strength and high toughness is developed on the basis of engineered unfolded structural proteins. The outstanding biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties allow application of the constructed fiber patches for efficient abdominal hernia repair without any tissue adhesion.








Abstract
The utility of unfolded structural proteins with diverse sequences offers multiple potentials to create functional biomaterials. However, it is challenging to overcome their structural defects for the development of biological fibers with a combination of high strength and high toughness. Herein, robust fibers from a recombinant unfolded protein consisting of resilin and supercharged polypeptide are fabricated via wet&#8208;spinning approaches. Particularly, the highly ordered structures induced by supramolecular complexation significantly improve the fiber's mechanical performance. In contrast to chemical fibers with high strength and low toughness (or vice versa), the present fibers demonstrate exceptional high strength and super&#8208;toughness, showing a breaking strength of &#8776;550&#160;MPa and a toughness of &#8776;250&#160;MJ m&#8211;3, respectively, surpassing many polymers and artificial protein fibers. Remarkably, the outstanding biocompatibility and superior mechanical properties allow application of the constructed fiber patches for efficient abdominal hernia repair in rat models. In stark contrast to clinical patches, there is no observed tissue adhesion by this treatment. Therefore, this work provides a new type of engineered protein material for surgical applications.

         <title>A Family of Frost&#8208;Resistant and Icephobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of cryoprotectant (and phase&#8208;change material (PCM)&#8208;based) compositions are engineered to be resistant against shear&#8208;flow and dissolution&#8208;driven material loss by securing them in a solid matrix, creating a slippery interface, capable of exceptional anti&#8208;icing/frosting, tailoring solid foulant adhesion, formulation&#8208;dependent optical transparency, self&#8208;healing, and thereby promising routes for the development of multifunctional surfaces that can significantly outperform commercial solutions.








Abstract
Anti&#8208;icing and icephobic materials play a crucial role in demanding applications ranging from energy to transportation systems operating in frigid climates. Despite remarkable advancements in the development of such surface coatings, the use of anti/de&#8208;icing chemicals remains one of the go&#8208;to solutions for ice management. However, they are notoriously prone to removal by shear forces and dissolution. Herein, the design rationale for developing a family of cryoprotectant and phase&#8208;change material (PCM)&#8208;based compositions in the form of mixtures, non&#8208;aqueous emulsions&#8208;creams, and gels that can substantially overcome such challenges is reported. This is achieved through the sustenance of an in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated surface hydration layer that protects the underlying substrate from a variety of foulants, varying from ice to disease&#8208;causing bacteria. Each formulation utilizes unique chemistry to curtail the embodied cryoprotectant loss and can be easily applied as an all&#8208;in&#8208;one sprayable/paintable coating capable of significantly outperforming untreated industrial materials in terms of their ability to delay condensation&#8208;frosting and shed ice simultaneously. Concomitantly, an array of formulation&#8208;specific functionalities is observed in the family, which includes optical transparency, mechanical durability, high shear&#8208;flow stability, and self&#8208;healing characteristics.

         <title>A Selective Targeting Anchor Strategy Affords Efficient and Stable Ideal&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aiming for hybrid perovskite solar cells, a novel strategy is developed that using ethylenediamine diiodide and phenethylammonium iodide as co&#8208;modifiers to selectively targeting anchor with lead&#8211;tin binary perovskite materials, resulting in comprehensively healing the dual&#8208;sourced defects. As a result, a champion efficiency of 22.51% is achieved, which is the record efficiency among the ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite solar cells (LTPSCs) with an ideal bandgap are demonstrated as a promising candidate to reach higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than their Pb&#8208;counterparts. Herein, a Br&#8208;free mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite material, FA0.8MA0.2Pb0.8Sn0.2I3, with a bandgap of 1.33&#160;eV, as a perovskite absorber, is selected. Through density functional theory calculations and optoelectronic techniques, it is demonstrated that both Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related A&#8208;site vacancies are pushed into deeper energetic depth, causing severe nonradiative recombination. Hence, a selective targeting anchor strategy that employs phenethylammonium iodide and ethylenediamine diiodide as co&#8208;modifiers to selectively anchor with Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related active sites and passivate bimetallic traps, respectively, is established. Furthermore, the selectivity of the molecular oriented anchor passivation is demonstrated through energetic depth specificity of Pb&#8208; and Sn&#8208;related traps. As a result, a substantially enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 0.79 to 0.90 V for the LTPSCs is achieved, yielding a champion PCE of 22.51%, which is the highest PCE among the reported ideal&#8208;bandgap PSCs. The VOC loss is reduced to 0.43&#160;V.

     alt="A Selective Targeting Anchor Strategy Affords Efficient and Stable Ideal-Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aiming for hybrid perovskite solar cells, a novel strategy is developed that using ethylenediamine diiodide and phenethylammonium iodide as co-modifiers to selectively targeting anchor with lead&#8211;tin binary perovskite materials, resulting in comprehensively healing the dual-sourced defects. As a result, a champion efficiency of 22.51% is achieved, which is the record efficiency among the ideal-bandgap perovskite solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite solar cells (LTPSCs) with an ideal bandgap are demonstrated as a promising candidate to reach higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than their Pb-counterparts. Herein, a Br-free mixed lead&#8211;tin perovskite material, FA&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, with a bandgap of 1.33&#160;eV, as a perovskite absorber, is selected. Through density functional theory calculations and optoelectronic techniques, it is demonstrated that both Pb- and Sn-related A-site vacancies are pushed into deeper energetic depth, causing severe nonradiative recombination. Hence, a selective targeting anchor strategy that employs phenethylammonium iodide and ethylenediamine diiodide as co-modifiers to selectively anchor with Pb- and Sn-related active sites and passivate bimetallic traps, respectively, is established. Furthermore, the selectivity of the molecular oriented anchor passivation is demonstrated through energetic depth specificity of Pb- and Sn-related traps. As a result, a substantially enhanced open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) from 0.79 to 0.90 V for the LTPSCs is achieved, yielding a champion PCE of 22.51%, which is the highest PCE among the reported ideal-bandgap PSCs. The &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; loss is reduced to 0.43&#160;V.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Modification of 2D Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the research of 2D photocatalysts has made great progress in the past decades, there are still many challenges in understanding the deep relationship between the surface state and the reaction mechanism. The surface modification strategies and reaction mechanisms of 2D photocatalysts are reviewed, and some useful views are put forward for future research in this field.








Abstract
2D materials show many particular properties, such as high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, high anisotropic degree, and adjustable chemical functionality. These unique properties in 2D materials have sparked immense interest due to their applications in photocatalytic systems, resulting in significantly enhanced light capture, charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, and surface reaction. Herein, the research progress in 2D photocatalysts based on varied compositions and functions, followed by specific surface modification strategies, is introduced. Fundamental principles focusing on light harvesting, charge separation, and molecular adsorption/activation in the 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based photocatalytic system are systemically explored. The examples described here detail the use of 2D materials in various photocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems, including water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and organic synthesis. Finally, by elaborating the challenges and possible solutions for developing these 2D&#160;materials, the review is expected to provide some inspiration for the future research of 2D materials used on efficient photocatalytic energy conversions.

         <title>Tuning Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Pathways for H2O2 Electrosynthesis via Engineering Atomically Dispersed Single Metal Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts in surface functionalization, coordination environments, and local carbon structures can effectively tune two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction pathways for efficient hydrogen peroxide production. The review summarizes recent progress on catalyst development and electrode design to electrolyzer fabrication for clean and sustainable hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation via the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative and green strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process and unsafe direct synthesis using H2 and O2. It enables on&#8208;site and decentralized H2O2 production using air and renewable electricity for various applications. Currently, atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts have emerged as the most promising platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR. Further tuning their central metal sites, coordination environments, and local structures can be highly active and selective for H2O2 production via the 2e&#8722; ORR. Herein, recent methodologies and achievements on developing single metal site catalysts for selective O2 to H2O2 reduction are summarized. Combined with theoretical computation and advanced characterization, a structure&#8211;property correlation to guide rational catalyst design with a favorable 2e&#8722; ORR process is aimed to provide. Due to the oxidative nature of H2O2 and the derived free radicals, catalyst stability and effective solutions to improve catalyst tolerance to H2O2 are emphasized. Transferring intrinsic catalyst properties to electrode performance for viable applications always remains a grand challenge. The key performance metrics and knowledge during the electrolyzer development are, therefore, highlighted.

         <title>Socially&#8208;Directed Development of Materials for Structural Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A socially&#8208;directed approach to materials research and development is imperative to address contemporary challenges and mitigate future damage related to environmental and social impacts. This paper reviews and identifies areas of opportunity at the cross&#8208;disciplinary intersection of materials science and engineering, humanistic fields, and the social sciences, in particular for the case of materials that exhibit structural color.








Abstract
Advancing a socially&#8208;directed approach to materials research and development is an imperative to address contemporary challenges and mitigate future detrimental environmental and social impacts. This paper reviews, synergizes, and identifies cross&#8208;disciplinary opportunities at the intersection of materials science and engineering with humanistic social sciences fields. Such integrated knowledge and methodologies foster a contextual understanding of materials technologies embedded within, and impacting broader societal systems, thus informing decision making upstream and throughout the entire research and development process toward more socially responsible outcomes. Technological advances in the development of structural color, which arises due to the incoherent and coherent scattering of micro&#8208;and nanoscale features and possesses a vast design space, are considered in this context. Specific areas of discussion include material culture, narratives, and visual perception, material waste and use, environmental and social life cycle assessment, and stakeholder and community engagement. A case study of the technical and social implications of bio&#8208;based cellulose (as a source for structurally colored products) is provided. Socially&#8208;directed research and development of materials for structural color hold significant capacity for improved planetary and societal impact across industries such as aerospace, consumer products, displays and sensors, paints and dyes, and food and agriculture.

The induced exosomes (iExo) obtained from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)&#8208;treated tumor cells are shown to be able to simulate the immunosuppressive function of tumor tissues to balance the immune hyperactivation of sepsis. Seven specific miRNAs in iExo are the key to its function. Exosome mimics prepared by encapsulating seven miRNAs with hyaluronic acid&#8211;polyethylenimine (HA&#8208;PEI) can also alleviate sepsis.








Abstract
Sepsis is a disease characterized by multiple organ failure caused by immune hyperactivation and cytokine storms. Studies have shown that the incidence of sepsis in melanoma patients is substantially lower compared to the general population. It is also observed that experimental tumor&#8208;bearing animals have high survival rates after sepsis induction, suggesting that tumors may suppress sepsis&#8208;associated immune overactivation, thereby alleviating sepsis. Based on the above&#8208;described findings, this work assesses whether tumor cells play an antisepsis role in mice through the secretion of exosomes. Analysis of exosome activity reveals that the induced exosomes (iExo) secreted by tumor cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment improve sepsis to a greater extent than normal secretory exosomes. Further analysis reveals that iExo exert their protective effects mainly through seven key miRNAs. In vitro bionic simulation of exosomes is carried out using exosome mimics generated by loading the aforementioned microRNAs into hyaluronic acid&#8211;polyethylenimine nanoparticles. Exosome mimics at specific miRNA ratios alleviate sepsis in mice and cynomolgus monkeys, indicating that biomimetic simulation of tumor&#8208;suppressive exosomes may represent a promising therapeutic method for the treatment of sepsis and cytokine&#8208;storm&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Affords Sustainable Plastics with Ultrahigh Robustness and Water&#8208;Assisted Arbitrarily Shape Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supramolecular plastic&#8208;like hydrogel (SPH) is introduced to fabricate sustainable plastics with simultaneous high mechanical performance and convenient water&#8208;induced processability. Diverse 2D/3D shapes are generated via origami, kirigami, embossing, etc., in virtue of plastic deformation and shape memory effect of SPHs. The plastics show Young's modulus up to 3.4&#160;GPa and tensile strength up to 124.0&#160;MPa due to dense inter&#8208;/intra&#8208;chain hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonds.








Abstract
Herein, the supramolecular plastic&#8208;like hydrogel (SPH) is introduced as a platform to fabricate sustainable plastics with ultrahigh stiffness and strength as well as water&#8208;assisted arbitrarily shapeable capability. The transparent plastics are constructed from SPHs of cellulose ether/polycarboxylic acid complexes and demonstrate mechanical robustness with Young's modulus up to 3.4&#160;GPa and tensile strength up to 124.0&#160;MPa, superior or comparable to most common plastics. Meanwhile, the shape of the plastics can be reversibly engineered by air drying of the SPHs with diverse 2D/3D shapes and structures, which are generated conveniently via origami, kirigami, embossing, etc., in virtue of plastic deformation and shape memory effect of SPHs. On the basis of multi&#8208;dimensional infrared&#8208;spectral analysis, it is revealed that the dense acid&#8211;acid and acid&#8211;ether hydrogen (H)&#8208;bonding network in the plastic is responsible for the mechanical robustness while the evolution of water&#8211;polymer H&#8208;bonds into polymer&#8211;polymer H&#8208;bonds during air drying contributes to the shape fixing. This work provides a novel method of manufacturing sustainable plastics with simultaneous strong mechanical performance and convenient processibility from hydrogels with plastic&#8208;like mechanical behavior.

         <title>A Binary Hydrate&#8208;Melt Electrolyte with Acetate&#8208;Oriented Cross&#8208;Linking Solvation Shells for Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte with a new solvation structures is developed. In such an electrolyte, the carboxylate groups in OAc&#8722; can bond with the H2O molecules in their neighboring solvation structures, achieving a cross&#8208;linked H&#8208;bond network. Therefore, the hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;product formation are remarkably restricted on Zn anodes in the hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with low cost and high safety are promising energy&#8208;storage devices. However, ZIBs with metal Zn anodes usually suffer from low coulombic efficiency and poor cycling performance due to the occurrence of side reactions on the Zn anodes. Here, a binary hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte is designed to suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction and by&#8208;product formation on Zn anodes by adjusting the Zn2+ solvation structure. In the solvation structure of the hydrate&#8208;melt ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte, the carboxylate group in OAc&#8722; will coordinate with the Zn2+, which will weaken the interaction between Zn2+ and H2O molecules to achieve higher ionization energy of H2O molecules. Simultaneously, these carboxylate groups of OAc&#8722; can serve as H&#8208;bond acceptors to construct H&#8208;bonds with H2O molecules in their neighboring solvation structures, forming a cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network. Such a cross&#8208;linking H&#8208;bond network further suppresses the water activity in ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. As a result, in such an electrolyte, the side reactions are effectively restricted on Zn anodes and thus Zn anodes can achieve a high coulombic efficiency of 99.59% even after cycling. To illustrate the feasibility of the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte in aqueous ZIBs, Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells are assembled based on the ZnCl2/Zn(OAc)2 electrolyte. The resultant Zn||p&#8208;chloranil cells exhibit enhanced cycling performance compared with the cases with a conventional ZnSO4 electrolyte.

         <title>Reducing Contact Resistance and Boosting Device Performance of Monolayer MoS2 by In Situ Fe Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable Fe doping strategy is developed in centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films with ultralow contact resistance. Excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and on/off current ratio is achieved, thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass. Unidirectional Fe&#8208;MoS2 domains are prepared on 2 in. commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance.








Abstract
2D semiconductors are emerging as plausible candidates for next&#8208;generation &#8220;More&#8208;than&#8208;Moore&#8221; nanoelectronics to tackle the scaling challenge of transistors. Wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, have been successfully synthesized recently; nevertheless, the absence of effective doping technology fundamentally results in energy barriers and high contact resistances at the metal&#8211;semiconductor interfaces, and thus restrict their practical applications. Herein, a controllable doping strategy in centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer MoS2 films is developed to address this critical issue and boost the device performance. The ultralow contact resistance and perfect Ohmic contact with metal electrodes are uncovered in monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2, which deliver excellent device performance featured with ultrahigh electron mobility and outstanding on/off current ratio. Impurity scattering is suppressed significantly thanks to the ultralow electron effective mass and appropriate doping site. Particularly, unidirectionally aligned monolayer Fe&#8208;doped MoS2 domains are prepared on 2 in. commercial c&#8208;plane sapphire, suggesting the feasibility of synthesizing wafer&#8208;scale 2D single&#8208;crystal semiconductors with outstanding device performance. This work presents the potential of high&#8208;performance monolayer transistors and enables further device downscaling and extension of Moore's law.

         <title>Accurately Localizing Multiple Nanoparticles in a Multishelled Matrix Through Shell&#8208;to&#8208;Core Evolution for Maximizing Energy&#8208;Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate structure of multiple cores localized separately in a hollow multishelled matrix is developed and achieved through a facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;. Such a structure could benefit charge diffusion, buffer the volume expansion, and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase, thus enabling the high&#8208;capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium&#8208;storage capability.








Abstract
Robust and fast lithium energy storage with a high energy density is highly desired to accelerate the market adoption of electric vehicles. To realize such a goal requires the development of electrode materials with a high capacity, however, such electrode materials suffer from huge volume expansion and induced short cycling life. Here, using tin (Sn) as an example, an ideal structure is designed to effectively solve these problems by separately localizing multiple Sn nanoparticles in a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon hollow multishelled structure with duplicated layers for carbon shell (Sn NPs@NxC HoMS&#8208;DL). The fabricated composite can promote ion and electron diffusion owing to the conductive network formed by connected multiple shells and cores, effectively buffer the volume expansion, and maintain a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Despite the challenging fabrication, such a structure is realized through an innovative and facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;, which is applicable for diverse low&#8208;melting&#8208;point materials. As expected, such a structure enables the high&#8208;capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium&#8208;storage capability: the developed Sn NPs@NxC HoMS&#8208;DL electrode maintains 96% of its theoretical capacity after 2000 cycles at 2C.

&lt;p&gt;A delicate structure of multiple cores localized separately in a hollow multishelled matrix is developed and achieved through a facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;. Such a structure could benefit charge diffusion, buffer the volume expansion, and stabilize the solid electrolyte interphase, thus enabling the high-capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium-storage capability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robust and fast lithium energy storage with a high energy density is highly desired to accelerate the market adoption of electric vehicles. To realize such a goal requires the development of electrode materials with a high capacity, however, such electrode materials suffer from huge volume expansion and induced short cycling life. Here, using tin (Sn) as an example, an ideal structure is designed to effectively solve these problems by separately localizing multiple Sn nanoparticles in a nitrogen-doped carbon hollow multishelled structure with duplicated layers for carbon shell (Sn NPs@N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;C HoMS-DL). The fabricated composite can promote ion and electron diffusion owing to the conductive network formed by connected multiple shells and cores, effectively buffer the volume expansion, and maintain a stable electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. Despite the challenging fabrication, such a structure is realized through an innovative and facile synthesis strategy of &#8220;in situ evolution of shell to core&#8221;, which is applicable for diverse low-melting-point materials. As expected, such a structure enables the high-capacity electrode material to realize nearly its theoretical lithium-storage capability: the developed Sn NPs@N&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;C HoMS-DL electrode maintains 96% of its theoretical capacity after 2000 cycles at 2C.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Tuned Multiphoton&#8208;Emitting InP Nanotetrapods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;crystalline nanotetrapod transits from a single to multiphoton emitter upon tuning its shape, which is revealed by single&#8208;particle spectroscopy. Calculation and time&#8208;resolved spectroscopic results prove that the precise changeover of the exciton confinement dimension is driven by the geometry of the particle shape. Interactions between multiple excitons allow a useful and direct manipulation of single&#8208;nanotetrapod luminescence.








Abstract
As the properties of a semiconductor material depend on the fate of the excitons, manipulating exciton behavior is the primary objective of nanomaterials. Although nanocrystals exhibit unusual excitonic characteristics owing to strong spatial confinement, studying the interactions between excitons in a single nanoparticle remains challenging due to the rapidly vanishing multiexciton species. Here, a platform for exciton tailoring using a straightforward strategy of shape&#8208;tuning of single&#8208;crystalline nanocrystals is presented. Spectroscopic and theoretical studies reveal a systematic transition of exciton confinement orientation from 3D to 2D, which is solely tuned by the geometric shape of material. Such a precise shape&#8208;effect triggers a multiphoton emission in single nanotetrapods with arms longer than the exciton Bohr radius of material. In consequence, the unique interplay between the multiple quantum states allows a geometric modulation of the quantum&#8208;confined Stark effect and nanocrystal memory effect in single nanotetrapods. These results provide a useful metric in designing nanomaterials for future photonic applications.

         <title>Bioinspired Tough Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte for Flexible Ultralong&#8208;Life Zinc&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tough, intrinsic hydroxide&#8208;conductive, bioinspired solid&#8208;state electrolyte is designed for flexible ultralong&#8208;life zinc&#8211;air batteries, which is featured of dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure with the synergism of ionomer and molecular polymer and gracefully obtains excellent comprehensive properties of mechanical robustness, high ion conductivity and good water retention.








Abstract
Manufacturing advanced solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) for flexible rechargeable batteries becomes increasingly important but remains grand challenge. The sophisticated structure of robust animal dermis and good water&#8208;retention of plant cell in nature grant germane inspirations for designing high&#8208;performance SSEs. Herein, tough bioinspired SSEs with intrinsic hydroxide ion (OH&#8722;) conduction are constructed by in situ formation of OH&#8722; conductive ionomer network within a hollow&#8208;polymeric&#8208;microcapsule&#8208;decorated hydrogel polymer network. By virtue of the bioinspired design and dynamic dual&#8208;penetrating network structure, the bioinspired SSEs simultaneously obtain mechanical robustness with 1800% stretchability, good water uptake of 107&#160;g g&#8722;1 and water retention, and superhigh ion conductivity of 215 mS cm&#8722;1. The nanostructure of bioinspired SSE and related ion&#8208;conduction mechanism are revealed and visualized by molecular dynamics simulation, where plenty of compact and superfast ion&#8208;transport channels are constructed, contributing to superhigh ion conductivity. As a result, the flexible solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries assembled with bioinspired SSEs witness high power density of 148 mW cm&#8722;2, specific capacity of 758 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultralong cycling stability of 320 h as well as outstanding flexibility. The bioinspired methodology and deep insight of ion&#8208;conduction mechanism will shed light on the design of advanced SSEs for flexible energy conversion and storage systems.

         <title>A Bi&#8208;Layer Hydrogel Cardiac Patch Made of Recombinant Functional Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of minimally invasive cardiac patch based on 3D printed, genetically modified double&#8208;layer protein gel is developed. The biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogel patch exhibits promising effects of hemostasis, fibrosis reduction, and heart function recovery on mice with two myocardium damage models.








Abstract
The development of minimally invasive cardiac patches, either as hemostatic dressing or treating myocardial infarction, is of clinical significance but remains a major challenge. Designing such patches often requires simultaneous consideration of several material attributes, including bioabsorption, non&#8208;toxicity, matching the mechanic properties of heart tissues, and working efficiently in wet and dynamic environments. Using genetically engineered multi&#8208;domain proteins, a printed bi&#8208;layer proteinaceous hydrogel patch for heart failure treatments is reported. The intrinsic self&#8208;healing nature of hydrogel materials physically enables seamless interfacial integration of two disparate hydrogel layers and functionally endows the cardiac patches with the combinatorial advantages of each layer. Leveraging the biocompatibility, structural stability, and tunable drug release properties of the bi&#8208;layer hydrogel, promising effects of hemostasis, fibrosis reduction, and heart function recovery on mice is demonstrated with two myocardium damage models. Moreover, this proteinaceous patch is proved biodegradable in vivo without any additive inflammations. In conclusion, this work introduces a promising new type of minimally invasive patch based on genetically modified double&#8208;layer protein gel for treating heart&#8208;related injuries or diseases.

The hybrid field&#8208;effect transistor (HyFET) superior for power electronic applications can be created by harnessing the merits of two representative wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, GaN and SiC. Yet, the incompactness in the epitaxy techniques hinders the development of the HyFET&#8212;GaN is usually grown on on&#8208;axis foreign substrates including SiC, whereas SiC homoepitaxy prefers off&#8208;axis substrates. This work presents a GaN&#8208;based heterostructure epitaxially grown on a conventional 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;SiC substrate and manifests its high quality and suitability for constructing GaN&#8208;based high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), thereby suggesting a practical approach to realizing the HyFET. In the meanwhile, a distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain relaxation process is proposed and studied with comprehensive characterizations.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics with Optimized Light Utilization for Printable Solar Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The existing conformation of active layer is defective for an employment of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) in solar windows. Herein, we successfully printed scalable solar windows by introducing a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure. The PPHJ structure can effectively improve the average visible transmittance (AVT) value while boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent devices due to the reduced optical loss. And the universality of PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST&#8208;OSCs is proved. Furthermore, the inset of superhydrophobic patterned soft insertion layer (PSIL) in the encapsulated window improves the waterproof performance without losing transparency. Accordingly, the semitransparent devices based on Y6 system afford a maximal efficiency of 14.62%, with a considerable AVT of 20.42%, and the resultant solar windows achieve a stabilized efficiency of 13.34% with excellent waterproof performance. Moreover, the PCE of the unilateral broken solar windows retain 70.6% of the initial efficiency after being placed under simulated rainfall conditions for 1200 h at room temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing conformation of active layer is defective for an employment of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) in solar windows. Herein, we successfully printed scalable solar windows by introducing a pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure. The PPHJ structure can effectively improve the average visible transmittance (AVT) value while boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent devices due to the reduced optical loss. And the universality of PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST-OSCs is proved. Furthermore, the inset of superhydrophobic patterned soft insertion layer (PSIL) in the encapsulated window improves the waterproof performance without losing transparency. Accordingly, the semitransparent devices based on Y6 system afford a maximal efficiency of 14.62%, with a considerable AVT of 20.42%, and the resultant solar windows achieve a stabilized efficiency of 13.34% with excellent waterproof performance. Moreover, the PCE of the unilateral broken solar windows retain 70.6% of the initial efficiency after being placed under simulated rainfall conditions for 1200 h at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Cascade Downregulation of HER Family by a Dual&#8208;Targeted Recombinant Protein&#8208;Drug Conjugate to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with HER2 positive cancer. However, relapse after this treatment remains a great challenge in clinical management due to tumors developing resistance, in which the HER network induces constitutive signal transduction. In addition, integrin receptors in the tumor extracellular matrix can also mitigate the therapeutic effect of inhibitors to the growth factors receptors and tyrosine kinases. Here we report the development of a recombinant protein (RP&#8208;HI) and its drug conjugates (RPDC&#8208;HI) to target both HER2 and integrin. When simultaneously blocking HER2 and integrin by RP&#8208;HI, functions of the HER family and their interactions with the integrin are disrupted by downregulated expressions of members of HER family, leading to inhibition of several downstream signal pathways. In combination with targeted delivery of the anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), RPDC&#8208;HI significantly improved the tumor inhibition efficacy with 97.5% in treating HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer in the mouse model, comparing to 34.3% when using free DOX. The dual&#8208;targeted RPDC&#8208;HI showed even better antitumor efficiency than monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Ttzm), when treating larger tumors. Thus, the developed dual&#8208;targeted RPDC platform offers a new and promising strategy for treating HER2&#8208;positive patients with synergistic therapeutic effects against tumor resistance to the conventional HER2 targeted treatment.

&lt;p&gt;The human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with HER2 positive cancer. However, relapse after this treatment remains a great challenge in clinical management due to tumors developing resistance, in which the HER network induces constitutive signal transduction. In addition, integrin receptors in the tumor extracellular matrix can also mitigate the therapeutic effect of inhibitors to the growth factors receptors and tyrosine kinases. Here we report the development of a recombinant protein (RP-HI) and its drug conjugates (RPDC-HI) to target both HER2 and integrin. When simultaneously blocking HER2 and integrin by RP-HI, functions of the HER family and their interactions with the integrin are disrupted by downregulated expressions of members of HER family, leading to inhibition of several downstream signal pathways. In combination with targeted delivery of the anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), RPDC-HI significantly improved the tumor inhibition efficacy with 97.5% in treating HER2-positive breast cancer in the mouse model, comparing to 34.3% when using free DOX.

         <title>Facile, Energy Efficient Microscale Fibrillation of Polyacrylamides under Ambient Conditions</title>

Abstract
Insight into fibre formation can provide new rationale for the design and preparation of fibres with programmed mechanical properties. While synthetic bioinspired fibres have shown impressive tensile properties, the fibre formation process remains poorly understood. Moreover, these systems are highly complex and their formation is environmentally and economically costly. We&#160;demonstrate controlled fibre formation under ambient conditions from polyacrylamide solutions with properties comparable to natural fibres such as wool and coir. Photopolymerization and subsequent microscale fibrillation of different acrylamides in water/ethanol mixtures a simple yields an energy&#8208;efficient route to fibre formation. This strategy reduces required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude. Through extensive experimental elucidation, insight into precise fibre forming conditions of polymeric solutions was&#160;achieved. Ethanol was&#160;utilized as a chain transfer agent to control molecular weight of the polyacrylamides and the entanglement regimes of the solutions were&#160;determined through rheological characterization showing fibre formation above the entanglement concentration. Unique from previously reported hydrogel microfibres, we&#160;have shown that we&#160;can obtain fibres with good mechanical properties without the need for composites or crosslinkers. The reported approach offers a platform for fibre formation under ambient conditions with molecular level understanding of their&#160;assembly.

         <title>Highly stable halide electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;Se batteries</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;S and Li&#8208;Se batteries are promising devices that can address the safety and electrochemical stability issues that arise from liquid&#8208;based systems. However, the solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;Se/S batteries usually present poor cycling stability due to the high resistance interfaces and decomposition of solid electrolytes caused by their narrow electrochemical stability windows. Here, we present an integrated solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;Se battery based on a halide Li3HoCl6 solid electrolyte with high ionic conductivity. The intrinsic wide electrochemical stability window of the Li3HoCl6 and its stability towards Se and the lithiated species effectively inhibits degeneration of the electrolyte and the Se cathode by suppressing the side reactions. The inherent thermodynamic mechanism of the lithiation/delithiation process of the Se cathode in solid was also revealed and confirmed by the theoretical calculations. The battery achieves a reversible capacity of 402 mAh g&#8722;1 after 750 cycles. The electrochemical performance, thermodynamic lithiation/delithiation mechanism, and stability of metal&#8208;halide&#8208;based Li&#8208;Se batteries confer theoretical study and practical applicability that extends to other energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Challenges and Perspectives of Organic Multivalent Metal&#8208;ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable organic multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries (MMIBs) have attracted a surge of interest as promising alternatives for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications because they can combine the advantages of both organic electrodes and multivalent metal&#8208;ion batteries. However, the development of organic MMIBs is hampered by many factors, which lags far behind the organic alkali metal&#8208; (e.g., Li&#8208;, Na&#8208; and K&#8208;) ion batteries. Herein, we first analyze the challenges that specifically faced by organic MMIBs and then discuss the strategies that could probably solve such challenges. As a special challenge that organic MMIBs are facing, the charge storage mechanism is particularly underlined to deep understand the structure&#8208;property relationships for guiding the future design of high&#8208;performance organic electrodes for MMIBs. And the perspectives are thereby elaborated in the following with the outlook of practical applications of organic MMIBs.

         <title>Efficient Alkaline Water/Seawater Hydrogen Evolution by a Nanorod&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;structured Ni&#8208;MoN Catalyst with Fast Water&#8208;dissociation Kinetics</title>

Abstract
Achieving efficient and durable nonprecious hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for scaling up alkaline water/seawater electrolysis is desirable but remains a significant challenge. We demonstrate here that a heterogeneous Ni&#8208;MoN catalyst consisting of Ni and MoN nanoparticles on amorphous MoN nanorods can sustain large&#8208;current&#8208;density HER with outstanding performance. The hierarchical nanorod&#8208;nanoparticle structure, along with a large surface area and multidimensional boundaries/defects endows the catalyst with abundant active sites. The hydrophilic surface helps to achieve accelerated gas&#8208;release capabilities and is effective preventing catalyst degradation during water electrolysis. Theoretical calculations further prove that the combination of Ni and MoN effectively modulates the electron redistribution at their interface and promotes the sluggish water&#8208;dissociation kinetics at the Mo sites. Consequently, this Ni&#8208;MoN catalyst requires low overpotentials of 61 and 136&#160;mV to drive current densities of 100 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, respectively, in 1 M KOH and remains stable during operation for 200 h at a constant current density of 100 or 500&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This good HER catalyst also works well in alkaline seawater electrolyte and shows outstanding performance toward overall seawater electrolysis with ultralow cell voltages.

         <title>Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Solution Discharge in Aprotic Li&#8208;O2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The surface discharge mechanism induced cathode passivation is a critical challenge that blocks the full liberation of the ultrahigh theoretical energy density of aprotic Li&#8208;O2 battery. Herein, we propose a facile and universal concept of hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted solvation to trigger the solution discharge process for averting the shortcomings associated with surface discharge. And 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote the solution discharge by hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8211; and Li2O2 (O&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O). Thus, the Li&#8208;O2 battery with 50&#160;mM DBHQ delivers an extraordinary discharge capacity of 18&#8239;945 mAh g&#8211;1 (i.e., 9.47 mAh cm&#8211;2), even surpassing the capacity endowed by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reduction mediator of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone (DBBQ). Besides, an ultrahigh Li2O2 yield of 97.1% has also been achieved due to the depressed reactivity of the reduced oxygen&#8208;containing species (O2&#8211;, LiO2, and Li2O2) by the solvating and antioxidative abilities of DBHQ. Consequently, the Li&#8208;O2 battery with DBHQ exhibits excellent performance for cycling lifetime and rate capability. Furthermore, the generalizability of this approach of hydrogen bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge has been verified by other soluble catalysts which contain &#8208;OH or &#8208;NH groups, with implications that could bring Li&#8208;O2 batteries one step closer to being a viable technology.

&lt;p&gt;The surface discharge mechanism induced cathode passivation is a critical challenge that blocks the full liberation of the ultrahigh theoretical energy density of aprotic Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery. Herein, we propose a facile and universal concept of hydrogen bond-assisted solvation to trigger the solution discharge process for averting the shortcomings associated with surface discharge.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Black Gold Film with Ultrahigh Porosity for Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Plasmonic metals demonstrate significant potential for solar steam generation (SSG) because of their localized surface plasmon resonance effect. However, the inherently narrow absorption spectra of plasmonic metals significantly limit their applications. The fabrication of nanostructures is essential to achieve broadband solar absorption for high&#8208;efficiency vapor generation. Herein, a self&#8208;supporting black gold film with an ultrahigh porosity and a hierarchically porous structure was fabricated by formulating an extremely dilute Cu99Au1 precursor and controlling the dealloying process. In&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ characterizations revealed the dealloying mechanism of Cu99Au1 in a 1 M HNO3 solution as that involving the phase transformation of Cu(Au) &#8594; Au(Cu) &#8594; Au, giant volume shrinkage (approximately 87%), structural evolution/coarsening of ligaments, and development of ultrahigh porosity (86.2%). The multiscale structure, consisting of ultrafine nanoporous nanowires, aligned nanogaps, and various micro&#8208;gaps, provided efficient broadband absorption over 300&#8211;2500&#160;nm, excellent hydrophilicity, and continuous water transport. Particularly, the nanoporous black Au film showed high SSG performance with an evaporation rate of 1.51&#160;kg m&#8211;2 h&#8211;1 and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 94.5% under a light intensity of 1&#160;kW m&#8211;2. These findings demonstrate that the nanoporous Au film has great potential for clean water production and seawater desalination.

         <title>Dynamic investigation of battery materials via advanced visualization: from particle, electrode to cell level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries, the most&#8208;popular secondary battery, are typically electrochemical systems controlled by ion insertion dynamics. The battery dynamics involves mass transport, charge transfer, ion&#8208;electron coupled reaction, electrolyte penetration, ion solvation, and interfacial evolution. However, the traditional electrochemical methods are hard to capture the accurate and individual details of different dynamic processes in the &#8220;black box&#8221; batteries, instead, only the net result of multi&#8208;factors on whole scale. Recently, different types of advanced visualization techniques are developed, which provide us powerful tools to track and monitor the internal on&#8208;site real&#8208;time dynamic processes inside the &#8220;black box&#8221; batteries, giving intuitionistic details and fine information at various scales from crystal lattice, single particle, electrode to cell level. Here, we review the recent progress on the investigation of electrochemical dynamics in battery materials via developed techniques across wide timescales and space&#8208;scales, including the dynamic process inside the active particle, kinetics issues at the electrode/electrolyte interface, dynamic inhomogeneity in electrode, and dynamic transportation in cell level. Finally, we summarize the fundamental principles to improve the battery dynamics and highlight new technologies for future more stringent conditions. In prospect, this review opens sight on battery interior for a clearer, deeper and more thorough understanding of dynamics.

         <title>A Facile &#8220;Double&#8208;Catalysts&#8221; Approach to Directionally Fabricate Pyridinic N&#63743;B&#8208;Pair&#8208;Doped Crystal Graphene Nanoribbons/Amorphous Carbon Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
The dominantly pyridinic N&#63743;B pair is rationally fabricated on hierarchically structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons/amorphous carbon by a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; strategy. As experiments and density functional theory demonstrated, the pyridinic N&#63743;B plays a key role for the highly catalytic performance (half&#8208;wave potential, 0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, electron transfer number, &#8776;3.94), comparable to commercial Pt/C and superior to most of carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts. 








Abstract
Carbon material is a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Doping of heteroatoms, the most widely used modulating strategy, has attracted many efforts in the past decade. Despite all this, the catalytic activity of heteroatoms&#8208;modulated carbon is hard to compare to that of metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Here, a &#8220;double&#8208;catalysts&#8221; (Fe salt, H3BO3) strategy is presented to directionally fabricate porous structure of crystal graphene nanoribbons (GNs)/amorphous carbon doped by pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs. The porous structure and GNs accelerate ion/mass and electron transport, respectively. The N percentage in pyridinic N&#63743;B pairs accounts for &#8776;80% of all N species. The pyridinic N&#63743;B pair drives the ORR via an almost 4e&#8722; transfer pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (0.812 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and onset potential (0.876 V vs RHE) in the alkaline solution. The ORR catalytic performance of the as&#8208;prepared carbon catalysts approximates commercial Pt/C and outperforms most prior carbon&#8208;based catalysts. The assembled Zn&#8211;air battery exhibits a high peak power density of 94 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory simulation reveals that the pyridinic N&#63743;B pair possesses the highest catalytic activity among all the potential configurations, due to the highest charge density at C active sites neighboring B, which enhances the interaction strength with the intermediates in the p&#8208;band center.

         <title>Engineering Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking Covalent Organic Frameworks as Pyroptosis Inducers for Boosting Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is constructed by dispersing active sites into the COF backbone. In contrast to their corresponding bulk species, these enzyme&#8208;mimicking COFs can serve as H2O2 homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, thus exhibiting excellent chemodynamic therapy and pyroptosis efficacy, favorable for boosting cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The engineering of a series of multienzyme&#8208;mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs), COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Fe, and COF&#8208;909&#8208;Ni, as pyroptosis inducers, remodeling the tumor microenvironment to boost cancer immunotherapy, is reported. Mechanistic studies reveal that these COFs can serve as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H2O2 levels, and they not only exhibit excellent superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;mimicking activity and convert superoxide radicals (O2&#8226;&#8722;) to H2O2 to facilitate H2O2 generation, but also possess outstanding glutathione peroxidase (GPx)&#8208;mimicking activity and deplete glutathione (GSH) to alleviate the scavenging of H2O2. Meanwhile, the outstanding photothermal therapy properties of these COFs can accelerate the Fenton&#8208;like ionization process to facilitate their chemodynamic therapy efficiency. One member, COF&#8208;909&#8208;Cu, can robustly induce gasdermin E (GSDME)&#8208;dependent pyroptosis and remodel the tumor microenvironment to trigger durable antitumor immunity, thus promoting the response rate of &#945;PD&#8208;1 checkpoint blockade and successfully restraining tumor metastasis and recurrence.

&lt;p&gt;A series of multienzyme-mimicking covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is constructed by dispersing active sites into the COF backbone. In contrast to their corresponding bulk species, these enzyme-mimicking COFs can serve as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; homeostasis disruptors to elevate intracellular H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels, thus exhibiting excellent chemodynamic therapy and pyroptosis efficacy, favorable for boosting cancer immunotherapy.

The 3D nanocomposite structure of the plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside LiMetal is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The 3D nanocomposite structure of plated lithium (LiMetal) and solid electrolyte interphases (SEI), including a polymer&#8208;rich surficial passivation layer (SEI exoskeleton) and inorganic SEI &#8220;fossils&#8221; buried inside amorphous Li matrix, is resolved using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. With ether&#8208;based DOLDME&#8208;LiTFSI electrolyte, LiF and Li2O nanocrystals are formed and embedded in a thin but tough amorphous polymer in the SEI exoskeleton. The fast Li&#8208;stripping directions are along [1&#175;10] or [121&#175;], which produces eight exposed {111} planes at halfway charging. Full Li stripping produces completely sagging, empty SEI husks that can sustain large bending and buckling, with the smallest bending radius of curvature observed approaching tens of nanometers without apparent damage. In the 2nd round of Li plating, a thin LiBCC sheet first nucleates at the current collector, extends to the top end of the deflated SEI husk, and then expands its thickness. The apparent zero wetting angle between LiBCC and the SEI interior means that the heterogeneous nucleation energy barrier is zero. Due to its complete&#8208;wetting property and chemo&#8208;mechanical stability, the SEI largely prevents further reactions between the Li metal and the electrolyte, which explains the superior performance of Li&#8208;metal batteries with ether&#8208;based electrolytes. However, uneven refilling of the SEI husks results in dendrite protrusions and some new SEI formation during the 2nd plating. A strategy to form bigger SEI capsules during the initial cycle with higher energy density than the following cycles enables further enhanced Coulombic efficiency to above 99%.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Targeted Lipid Nanotherapeutic Boost for Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase III clinical trials of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Here, dual&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed for chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer. T&#8208;iLNTB boosts chemotherapeutic effect in cancer cells, increases an immunogenic cell death and reprograms tumor myeloid cells, consequently, recruits T cells and boosts responsiveness to immunotherapeutics. T&#8208;iLNTB can become a novel therapeutic modality in cancer.








Abstract
Chemo&#8208;immunotherapy is a combination of &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapy with immunotherapy and it is considered the most advanced therapeutic modality for various types of cancers. However, many cancer patients still poorly respond to current regimen of chemo&#8208;immunotherapy and suggest nanotherapeutics as a boosting agent. Recently, heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO1) is shown to act as an immunotherapeutic molecule in tumor myeloid cells, in addition to general chemoresistance function in cancer cells suggesting that HO1&#8208;targeted therapeutics can become a novel, optimal strategy for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in the clinic. Currently the available HO1&#8208;inhibitors demonstrate serious adverse effects in clinical use. Herein, tumor myeloid cell&#8208; and cancer cell&#8208;dual targeted HO1&#8208;inhibiting lipid nanotherapeutic boost (T&#8208;iLNTB) is developed using RNAi&#8208;loaded lipid nanoparticles. T&#8208;iLNTB&#8208;mediated HO1&#8208;inhibition sensitizes cancer cells to &#8220;standard&#8208;of&#8208;care&#8221; chemotherapeutics by increasing immunogenic cell death, and directly reprograms tumor myeloid cells with distinguished phenotype. Furthermore, tumor myeloid cell reprogramming by T&#8208;iLNTB induces CD8+ cytotoxic T cell recruitment, which drives &#8220;Cold&#8208;to&#8208;Hot&#8221; transition and correlates with improved responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination therapy. Finally, ex vivo study proves that HO1&#8208;inhibition directly affects tumor macrophage differentiation. This study demonstrates the potential of T&#8208;iLNTB as a novel therapeutic modality for boosting chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Field Simulations of Tunable Polar Topologies in Lead&#8208;Free Ferroelectric/Paraelectric Multilayers with Ultrahigh Energy&#8208;Storage Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free ferroelectric/paraelectric trilayers with tunable polar topologies are designed. Relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors are achievable by tailoring the topology with diverse dynamics. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage density above 170 J cm&#8211;1 and efficiency of 95% are exhibited in polar vortices. This strategy exemplifies a new paradigm to enhance energy storage via topology engineering.








Abstract
Dielectric capacitors are emerging energy&#8208;storage components that require both high energy&#8208;storage density and high efficiency. The conventional approach to energy&#8208;storage enhancement is polar nanodomain engineering via chemical modification. Here, a new approach of domain engineering is proposed by exploiting the tunable polar topologies that have been observed recently in ferroelectric/paraelectric multilayer films. Using phase&#8208;field simulations, it is demonstrated that vortex, spiral, and in&#8208;plane polar structures can be stabilized in BiFeO3/SrTiO3 (BFO/STO) multilayers by tailoring the strain state and layer thickness. Various switching dynamics are realized in these polar topologies, resulting in relaxor&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;, antiferroelectric&#8208;, and paraelectric&#8208;like polarization behaviors, respectively. Ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage densities above 170 J cm&#8722;3 and efficiencies above 95% are achievable in STO/BFO/STO trilayers. This strategy should be generally implementable in other multilayer dielectrics and offers a new avenue to enhancing energy storage by tuning the polar topology and thus the polarization characteristics.

Abstract
Microbial bioelectronic devices integrate naturally occurring or synthetically engineered electroactive microbes with microelectronics. These devices have a broad range of potential applications, but engineering the biotic&#8211;abiotic interface for biocompatibility, adhesion, electron transfer, and maximum surface area remains a challenge. Prior approaches to interface modification lack simple processability, the ability to pattern the materials, and/or a significant enhancement in currents. Here, a novel conductive polymer coating that significantly enhances current densities relative to unmodified electrodes in microbial bioelectronics is reported. The coating is based on a blend of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) crosslinked with poly(2&#8208;hydroxyethylacrylate) (PHEA) along with a thin polydopamine (PDA) layer for adhesion to an underlying indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. When used as an interface layer with the current&#8208;producing bacterium Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, this material produces a 178&#8208;fold increase in the current density compared to unmodified electrodes, a current gain that is higher than previously reported thin&#8208;film 2D coatings and 3D conductive polymer coatings. The chemistry, morphology, and electronic properties of the coatings are characterized and the implementation of these coated electrodes for use in microbial fuel cells, multiplexed bioelectronic devices, and organic electrochemical transistor based microbial sensors are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this simple coating will advance the development of microbial bioelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;A conductive polymer-based thin-film coating that significantly enhances biotic current densities in microbial bioelectronic devices is reported. The coating is comprehensively characterized, and low-cost processing and patterning of the coating and the deposition of different microbial strains on a single substrate are demonstrated.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Crystalline Layers for Printable Direct Conversion X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>

Thick crystalline quasi&#8208;2D perovskite layers can be fabricated by a &#8220;hot&#8208;casting&#8221; method yielding an exceptional uniformity. As a result, high performance photodiodes using the quasi&#8208;2D layers are developed on both rigid and flexible substrates that respond sensitively to X&#8208;ray photons. This study paves the path toward printable direct conversion X&#8208;ray imager development.








Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite film&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector is an appealing technology for assembling large scale imager by printing methods. However, thick crystalline layer without trap and solvent residual is challenging to fabricate. Here, the authors report a solution method to produce high quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite crystalline layers and detectors that are suitable for X&#8208;ray imaging. By introducing n&#8208;butylamine iodide into methylammonium lead iodide precursor and coating at elevated temperatures, compact and crystalline layers with exceptional uniformity are obtained on both rigid and flexible substrates. Photodiodes built with the quasi&#8208;2D layers exhibit a low dark current and stable operation under constant electrical field over 96 h in dark, and over 15 h under X&#8208;ray irradiation. The detector responds sensitively under X&#8208;ray, delivering a high sensitivity of 1214&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a sensitivity gain is observed when operated under higher fields. Finally, high resolution images are demonstrated using a single pixel device that can resolve 80&#8211;200&#160;&#181;m features. This work paves the path for printable direct conversion X&#8208;ray imager development.

         <title>An Energy&#8208;Storing DNA&#8208;Based Nanocomplex for Laser&#8208;Free Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A DNA nanocomplex incorporating persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles is prepared, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activating photodynamic therapy (PDT) of breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. Laser&#8208;free PDT is specifically initiated in the glutathione&#8208;overexpressed tumor cells and completes in a way of self&#8208;supplying O2 and self&#8208;irradiating.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a therapeutic strategy that is dependent on external light irradiation that faces a major challenge in cancer treatment due to the poor tissue&#8208;penetration depths of light irradiation. Herein, a DNA nanocomplex that integrates persistent&#8208;luminescence nanoparticles (PLNPs) is developed, which realizes tumor&#8208;site glutathione&#8208;activated PDT for breast cancer without exogenous laser excitation. The scaffold of the nanocomplex is AS1411&#8208;aptamer&#8208;encoded ultralong single&#8208;stranded DNA chain with two functions: i) providing sufficient intercalation sites for the photosensitizer, and ii) recognizing nucleolin that specifically overexpresses on the surface of cancer cells. The PLNPs in the nanocomplex are energy&#8208;charged to act as a self&#8208;illuminant and coated with a shell of MnO2 for blocking energy degradation. In response to the overexpressed glutathione in cancer cells, the MnO2 shell decomposes to provide Mn2+ to catalytically produce O2, which is essential to PDT. Meanwhile, PLNPs are released and act as a self&#8208;illuminant to activate the photosensitizer to convert O2 into cytotoxic 1O2. Significant tumor inhibition effects are demonstrated in breast tumor xenograft models without exogenous laser excitation. It is envisioned that a laser&#8208;excitation&#8208;free PDT strategy enabled by the PLNP&#8211;DNA nanocomplex promotes the development of PDT and provides a new local therapeutic approach.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ternary Perovskite&#8211;Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells based on 2D:3D perovskites incorporated with n&#8208;type low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap conjugated organic molecules exhibit power conversion efficiency over 23%, and dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis are demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells in which 2D perovskites are incorporated within a 3D perovskite network exhibit improved stability with respect to purely 3D systems, but lower record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Here, a breakthrough is reported in achieving enhanced PCEs, increased stability, and suppressed photocurrent hysteresis by incorporating n&#8208;type, low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap conjugated organic molecules into 2D:3D mixed perovskite composites. The resulting ternary perovskite&#8211;organic composites display extended absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region, improved film morphology, enlarged crystallinity, balanced charge transport, efficient photoinduced charge transfer, and suppressed counter&#8208;ion movement. As a result, the ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells exhibit PCEs over 23%, which are among the best PCEs for perovskite solar cells with p&#8211;i&#8211;n device structure. Moreover, the ternary perovskite&#8211;organic solar cells possess dramatically enhanced stability and diminished photocurrent hysteresis. All these results demonstrate that the strategy of exploiting ternary perovskite&#8211;organic composite thin films provides a facile way to realize high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>A Tissue Adhesion&#8208;Controllable and Biocompatible Small&#8208;Scale Hydrogel Adhesive Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible small&#8208;scale adhesive robot is developed by using hydrogels of different Young's moduli with octopus&#8208;inspired micropatterns. The robot can continuously and efficiently conduct biomedical functions in underwater environment due to controllable wet tissue adhesion.








Abstract
Recently, the realization of minimally invasive medical interventions on targeted tissues using wireless small&#8208;scale medical robots has received an increasing attention. For effective implementation, such robots should have a strong adhesion capability to biological tissues and at the same time easy controlled detachment should be possible, which has been challenging. To address such issue, a small&#8208;scale soft robot with octopus&#8208;inspired hydrogel adhesive (OHA) is proposed. Hydrogels of different Young's moduli are adapted to achieve a biocompatible adhesive with strong wet adhesion by preventing the collapse of the octopus&#8208;inspired patterns during preloading. Introduction of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel for dome&#8208;like protuberance structure inside the sucker wall of polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogel provides a strong tissue attachment in underwater and at the same time enables easy detachment by temperature changes due to its temperature&#8208;dependent volume change property. It is finally demonstrated that the small&#8208;scale soft OHA robot can efficiently implement biomedical functions owing to strong adhesion and controllable detachment on biological tissues while operating inside the body. Such robots with repeatable tissue attachment and detachment possibility pave the way for future wireless soft miniature robots with minimally invasive medical interventions.

Introduction of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) hydrogel for dome-like protuberance structure inside the sucker wall of polyethylene glycol diacrylate hydrogel provides a strong tissue attachment in underwater and at the same time enables easy detachment by temperature changes due to its temperature-dependent volume change property. It is finally demonstrated that the small-scale soft OHA robot can efficiently implement biomedical functions owing to strong adhesion and controllable detachment on biological tissues while operating inside the body. Such robots with repeatable tissue attachment and detachment possibility pave the way for future wireless soft miniature robots with minimally invasive medical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Carbon Corrosion and Cu Leaching as a Strategy for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Multimetal Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in multimetal electrocatalysts can effectively boost catalytic activity with a low overpotential. More importantly, by placing a single particle on a nanoelectrode, structural changes during electrocatalysis can be directly evaluated, providing in&#8208;depth understanding for the catalyst's excellent OER performance.








Abstract
The number of active sites and their intrinsic activity are key factors in designing high&#8208;performance catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The synthesis, properties, and in&#8208;depth characterization of a homogeneous CoNiFeCu catalyst are reported, demonstrating that multimetal synergistic effects improve the OER kinetics and the intrinsic activity. In situ carbon corrosion and Cu leaching during the OER lead to an enhanced electrochemically active surface area, providing favorable conditions for improved electronic interaction between the constituent metals. After activation, the catalyst exhibits excellent activity with a low overpotential of 291.5&#160;&#177; 0.5&#160;mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 43.9 mV dec&#8722;1. It shows superior stability compared to RuO2 in 1 m KOH, which is even preserved for 120 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 7 m KOH at 50&#160;&#176;C. Single particles of this CoNiFeCu after their placement on nanoelectrodes combined with identical location transmission electron microscopy before and after applying cyclic voltammetry are investigated. The improved catalytic performance is due to surface carbon corrosion and Cu leaching. The proposed catalyst design strategy combined with the unique single&#8208;nanoparticle technique contributes to the development and characterization of high&#8208;performance catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion.

         <title>Bistability, Remanence, Read/Write&#8208;Memory, and Logic Gate Function via a Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hysteresis of a thermally responsive polymer is shown to lead to bistability and remanence. This is used to write information on thin&#8208;layer displays using lasers or simple pens. The states can additionally be switched by pH, enabling an AND logic gate function. An unusual memory state allows encoded information to be hidden.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials change their state in response to external triggers. Switching between different states enables information to be written, stored, and read, if the transition between the states exhibits hysteresis. Thermally responsive polymers exhibit an intrinsic hysteresis for the volume phase transition between the swollen and de&#8208;swollen solution state. Here, it is shown that this hysteresis can be used to realize bistability, remanence, and reversible write/read information storage. This is demonstrated for the simplest and most widely used thermoresponsive polymer, poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), as well as for PNIPAM block copolymers, which widens the hysteresis window. The hysteresis is shown to be related to cluster domain assembly/disassembly during the phase transition. Information can be written thermally using a laser, or using heated or cooled pen tips on a thin&#8208;film backscattering display. The bistable state can additionally be switched by pH, enabling an AND logic gate function. Furthermore, an unusual memory state is discovered, where information is visible in the hysteresis window and invisible at higher temperatures, allowing encoded information to be hidden. Since hysteresis is a very common intrinsic phenomenon for responsive materials, this principle to encode and store information is potentially applicable to a broad range of responsive materials.

         <title>Transforming the Chemical Structure and Bio&#8208;Nano Activity of Doxorubicin by Ultrasound for Selective Killing of Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrasonic transformation of doxorubicin into a tumor selective nanodrug is presented. The nanodrug maintains the antiproliferative activity against several cancer cell lines without being toxic to healthy cells as verified in 2D/3D coculture. The nanodrug associates with lipid rafts on mitochondria membranes to produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species. In vivo study reveals accumulation of the nanodrug in the lung.








Abstract
Reconfiguring the structure and selectivity of existing chemotherapeutics represents an opportunity for developing novel tumor&#8208;selective drugs. Here, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the use of high&#8208;frequency sound waves is demonstrated to transform the nonselective anthracycline doxorubicin into a tumor selective drug molecule. The transformed drug self&#8208;aggregates in water to form &#8776;200&#160;nm nanodrugs without requiring organic solvents, chemical agents, or surfactants. The nanodrugs preferentially interact with lipid rafts in the mitochondria of cancer cells. The mitochondrial localization of the nanodrugs plays a key role in inducing reactive oxygen species mediated selective death of breast cancer, colorectal carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and drug&#8208;resistant cell lines. Only marginal cytotoxicity (80&#8211;100% cell viability) toward fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes is observed, even after administration of high doses of the nanodrug (25&#8211;40&#160;&#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1). Penetration, cytotoxicity, and selectivity of the nanodrugs in tumor&#8208;mimicking tissues are validated by using a 3D coculture of cancer and healthy cells and 3D cell&#8208;collagen constructs in a perfusion bioreactor. The nanodrugs exhibit tropism for lung and limited accumulation in the liver and spleen, as suggested by in vivo biodistribution studies. The results highlight the potential of this approach to transform the structure and bioactivity of anticancer drugs and antibiotics bearing sono&#8208;active moieties.

         <title>High&#8208;Z&#8208;Sensitized Radiotherapy Synergizes with the Intervention of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway for In Situ Tumor Vaccination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel radiosensitizer (physcion&#8208;encapsulated poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified layered gadolinium hydroxide (Phy@PLGdH) nanosheets) is developed to amplify radiation&#8208;therapy (RT)&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage for potent immunogenic tumor cell death. The results show that Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT yields great in situ tumor vaccination and obviously primes CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
In situ tumor vaccination is preliminarily pursued to strengthen antitumor immune response. Immunogenic tumor cell death spontaneously releases abundant antigens and adjuvants for activation of dendritic cells, providing a paragon opportunity for establishing efficient in situ vaccination. Herein, Phy@PLGdH nanosheets are constructed by integrating physcion (Phy, an inhibitor of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP)) with layered gadolinium hydroxide (PLGdH) nanosheets to boost radiation&#8208;therapy (RT)&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) for potent in situ tumor vaccination. It is first observed that sheet&#8208;like PLGdH can present superior X&#8208;ray deposition and tumor penetrability, exhibiting improved radiosensitization in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the destruction of cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and nucleotide homeostasis by Phy&#8208;mediated PPP intervention can further amplify PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT&#8208;mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage, which correspondingly results in effective ICD and enhance the immunogenicity of irradiated tumor cells. Consequently, Phy@PLGdH&#8208;sensitized RT successfully primes robust CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;dependent antitumor immunity to potentiate checkpoint blockade immunotherapies against primary and metastatic tumors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Epitaxial Ferroelectric Oxide Nanospring with Super&#8208;Scalability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxial oxide nanosprings are fabricated by etching sacrificial layer. La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 nanosprings can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The ferroelectric/ferroelastic domain switching associated with highly coupled strain and polarization provides the tolerance for shape deformation and the energy for recovery.








Abstract
Oxide nanosprings have attracted many research interests because of their anticorrosion, high&#8208;temperature tolerance, oxidation resistance, and enhanced&#8208;mechanic&#8208;response from unique helix structures, enabling various applications like nanomanipulators, nanomotors, nanoswitches, sensors, and energy harvesters. However, preparing oxide nanosprings is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, an approach for preparing self&#8208;assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nanosprings with built&#8208;in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures is developed. It is found that these LSMO/BTO nanosprings can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometrical limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super&#8208;scalability with full recovery capability. The phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co&#8208;existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide heterostructural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built&#8208;in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nanosprings that can be applied to various technologies.

         <title>Scalable Growth of Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Films via an Orientation Filter Funnel for High&#8208;Performance Transistors with Excellent Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new orientation filter funnel method is developed for scalable growth of organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) with singly orientated crystals. This approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic axis and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of OSCFs. The obtained OSCFs show 4.5&#8208;fold enhanced mobility and excellent uniformity with mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%.








Abstract
Organic single&#8208;crystal films (OSCFs) provide an unprecedented opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. However, crystallization of organic films is normally governed by stochastic nucleation and incoherent growth, posing a formidable challenge to grow large&#8208;sized OSCFs. Here, an &#8220;orientation filter funnel&#8221; concept is presented for the scalable growth of OSCFs with well&#8208;aligned, singly orientated crystals. By rationally designing solvent wetting/dewetting patterns on the substrate, this approach can produce seed crystals with the same crystallographic orientation and then maintain epitaxial growth of these crystals, enabling the formation of large&#8208;area OSCFs. As a result, this unique concept for crystal growth not only enhances the average mobility of organic film by 4.5&#8208;fold but also improves its uniformity of electrical properties, with a low mobility variable coefficient of 9.8%, the new lowest record among organic devices. The method offers a general and scalable route to produce OSCFs toward real&#8208;word electronic applications.

         <title>Achieving Remarkable Charge Density via Self&#8208;Polarization of Polar High&#8208;k Material in a Charge&#8208;Excitation Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;polarization effect is found under charge excitation, which significantly improves the performance of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). This work provides a new strategy to enhance the dielectric properties of polar dielectric materials, and the realization of high charge density provides a promising strategy for achieving high&#8208;output TENGs toward various applications.








Abstract
Boosting output charge density is top priority for achieving high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). The charge&#8208;excitation strategy is demonstrated to be a superior approach to acquire high output charge density. Meanwhile, the molecular charge behaviors in the dielectric under a strong electric field from high charge density bring new physics that are worth exploring. Here, a rapid self&#8208;polarization effect of a polar dielectric material by the superhigh electric field in a charge&#8208;excitation TENG is reported, by which the permittivity of the polar dielectric material realizes self&#8208;increase to a saturation, and thus enhances the output charge density. Consequently, an ultrahigh charge density of 3.53 mC m&#8722;2 is obtained with 7&#160;&#181;m homemade lead zirconate titanate&#8722;poly(vinylidene fluoride) composite film in the atmosphere with 5% relative humidity, which is the highest charge density for TENGs with high durability currently. This work provides new guidance for dielectric material optimization under charge excitation to boost the output performance of TENGs toward practical applications.

         <title>Alternate Storage of Opposite Charges in Multisites for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Al&#8211;MOF Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges in multisite is demonstrated in a 2D Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) cathode to achieve a high energy density for Al&#8211;MOF batteries. The MOF can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which doubles the capacity compared with the storage of the same charge in one active site.








Abstract
The limited active sites of cathode materials in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries restrict the storage of more large&#8208;sized Al&#8208;complex ions, leading to a low celling of theoretical capacity. To make the utmost of active sites, an alternate storage mechanism of opposite charges (AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations) in multisites is proposed herein to achieve an ultrahigh capacity in Al&#8211;metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) battery. The bipolar ligands (oxidized from 18&#960; to 16&#960; electrons and reduced from 18&#960; to 20&#960; electrons in a planar cyclic conjugated system) can alternately uptake and release AlCl4&#8722; anions and AlCl2+ cations in charge/discharge processes, which can double the capacity of unipolar ligands. Moreover, the high&#8208;density active Cu sites (Cu nodes) in the 2D Cu&#8208;based MOF can also store AlCl2+ cations for a higher capacity. The rigid and extended MOF structure can address the problems of high solubility and poor stability of small organic molecules. As a result, three&#8208;step redox reactions with two&#8208;electron transfer in each step are demonstrated in charge/discharge processes, achieving high reversible capacity (184 mAh g&#8722;1) and energy density (177&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) of the optimized cathode in an Al&#8211;MOF battery. The findings provide a new insight for the rational design of stable high&#8208;energy Al&#8211;MOF batteries.

         <title>Enabling Fast Na+ Transfer Kinetics in the Whole&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Region of Hard&#8208;Carbon Anodes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region is realized by rational manipulation of the microstructure of hard carbons (HCs) using a ZnO&#8208;assisted bulk etching strategy.

Efficient electrode materials, that combine high power and high energy, are the crucial requisites of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), which have unwrapped new possibilities in the areas of grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Hard carbons (HCs) are considered as the leading candidate anode materials for SIBs, however, the primary challenge of slow charge&#8208;transfer kinetics at the low potential region (&lt;0.1&#160;V) remains unresolved till date, and the underlying structure&#8211;performance correlation is under debate. Herein, ultrafast sodium storage in the whole&#8208;voltage&#8208;region (0.01&#8211;2&#160;V), with the Na+ diffusion coefficient enhanced by 2 orders of magnitude (&#8776;10&#8211;7 cm2 s&#8211;1) through rationally deploying the physical parameters of HCs using a ZnO&#8208;assisted bulk etching strategy is reported. It is unveiled that the Na+ adsorption energy (Ea) and diffusion barrier (Eb) are in a positive and negative linear relationship with the carbon p&#8208;band center, respectively, and balance of Ea and Eb is critical in enhancing the charge&#8208;storage kinetics. The charge&#8208;storage mechanism in HCs is evidenced through comprehensive in(ex) situ techniques. The as prepared HCs microspheres deliver a record high rate performance of 107 mAh g&#8211;1 @ 50 A g&#8211;1 and unprecedented electrochemical performance at extremely low temperature (426 mAh g&#8211;1 @ &#8722;40 &#176;C).

         <title>Direct Synthesis of Photosensitizable Bacterial Cellulose as Engineered Living Material for Skin Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>

Photosensitizable bacterial cellulose is obtained via direct microbial metabolism biosynthesis for wound repair in vivo with effective antibacterial functions.








Abstract
Living materials based on bacterial cellulose (BC) represent a natural and promising candidate for wound dressing. Both physical adsorption and chemical methods have been applied to BC for realizing antibacterial function. However, effective and long&#8208;lasting incorporation of bactericidal moieties to BC remains challenging. Herein, a Komagataeibacter sucrofermentans&#8208;based direct synthetic method to fabricate photosensitizer&#8208;grafted BC through&#160;in situ&#160;bacterial metabolism in the presence of TPEPy&#8208;modified glucose is explored. The results verify that the direct biosynthesis method is efficient and convenient to endow BC with outstanding fluorescence and light&#8208;triggered photodynamic bactericidal activity for skin wound repair. This work presents a new approach to fabricate eco&#8208;friendly and active wound dressing with light&#8208;controlled bactericidal activity by microbial metabolism. The successful modification of the glucose carbon source of microorganisms also offers insights for biosyntheses of other living materials through microbial metabolism.

A single&#8208;atom W&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet&#8202;@&#8202;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) is synthesized, as a highly efficient and stable electrocatalyst for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The introduction of single&#8208;atom W causes the delocalization of the Ni spin states, which increases the Ni d&#8208;electronic states and optimizes the H* adsorption kinetics, significantly reducing the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step (O* to OOH*). 








Abstract
Developing robust and highly active non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) is crucial for the industrialization of hydrogen energy. In this study, a highly active and durable single&#8208;atom W&#8208;doped NiS0.5Se0.5 nanosheet&#8202;@&#8202;NiS0.5Se0.5 nanorod heterostructure (W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5) electrocatalyst is prepared. W&#8208;NiS0.5Se0.5 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the HER and OER with ultralow overpotentials (39 and 106&#160;mV for the HER and 171 and 239&#160;mV for the OER at 10 and 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively) and excellent long&#8208;term durability (500 h), outperforming commercial precious&#8208;metal catalysts and many other previously reported transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based compounds (TMCs). The introduction of single&#8208;atom W delocalizes the spin state of Ni, which results in an increase in the Ni d&#8208;electron density. This causes the optimization of the adsorption/desorption process of H and a significant reduction in the adsorption free energy of the rate&#8208;determining step (O* &#8594; OOH*), thus accelerating the thermodynamics and kinetics of the HER and OER. This work provides a rational feasible strategy to design single&#8208;atom catalysts for water splitting and to develop advanced TMC electrocatalysts by regulating delocalized spin states.

         <title>Stabilizing Layered Structure in Aqueous Electrolyte via Dynamic Water Intercalation/Deintercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>

To stabilize the layered structure in aqueous electrolyte, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t is developed to mitigate H+ attack and the adverse phase transition. Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t provides open channels from (001) planes, enabling dynamic water intercalation/deintercalation in the layered structure. With reversible water intercalation/deintercalation, the layered structure is effectively stabilized in aqueous electrolyte, resulting in outstanding cycle performance in aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous lithium&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs) with nonflammable feature attract great attention for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the layered cathode materials (such as LiCoO2) present serious capacity decay in ALIBs. The degradation mechanism of layered cathode materials in ALIBs is still not clear and an effective strategy to improve cycling stability remains a great challenge. In this work, the authors use LiCoO2 as a typical example to investigate its structural degradation in aqueous electrolytes. It is found that H+ insertion accelerated irreversible layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition is the main reason causing structural degradation and fast capacity fading in LiCoO2. Subsequently, Li&#8208;excess Li1+tCo1&#8722;tO2&#8722;t with intermediate spin Co3+ is developed to mitigate H+ influence and the adverse phase transition in aqueous electrolyte. It is interesting to discover that reversible water intercalation/deintercalation occurs in the layered structure during charge/discharge, which effectively suppresses the layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition with cycling. Benefiting from the stabilized layered structure, the Li&#8208;excess Li1.08Co0.92O1.92 shows a significantly improved cycling performance in the neutral aqueous electrolyte with a large specific capacity and excellent rate capability. This work provides a promising structural regulation strategy for the layered cathode materials, enabling their potential application in ALIBs.

         <title>Synergetic Anion Vacancies and Dense Heterointerfaces into Bimetal Chalcogenide Nanosheet Arrays for Boosting Electrocatalysis Sulfur Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoZn&#8208;S nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces show an outstanding sulfur conversion activity for lithium&#8722;sulfur batteries. DFT calculations reveal that the sulfur vacancies and built&#8208;in interfacial field can promote the formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity. The catalytic sulfur cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance especially under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.








Abstract
Vacancy and interface engineering are regarded as effective strategies to modulate the electronic structure and enhance the activity of metal chalcogenides. However, the practical application of metal chalcogenides in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries is limited by their low conductivity, rapid decline in catalytic activity, and large volume variation during the discharging/charging process. Herein, bimetal sulfide (CoZn&#8208;S) nanosheet arrays with sulfur vacancies and dense heterointerfaces are proposed to accelerate sulfur conversion and improve the performance of Li&#8722;S batteries. Systematic investigations reveal that sulfur&#8208;vacancy and build&#8208;in interfacial field in CoZn&#8208;S facilitate the electron transfer and regulate the electronic structure. The well&#8208;designed 3D nanosheet array structures shorten the ion&#8208;transport pathway and inhibit the volume fluctuation of CoZn&#8208;S during the electrocatalysis process. Density functional theory studies confirm that the built&#8208;in interfacial field and sulfur vacancy can promote the thermodynamic formation and decomposition of Li2S, thus improving their intrinsic activity.

A self&#8208;assembled CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/shell nanoplatelets&#8208;whispering gallery mode (WGM) microlaser with ultralow&#8208;threshold, tunable&#8208;wavelength, and excellent photostability is proposed. Both multi&#8208; and single&#8208;mode high quality factor WGM lasing are achieved with ultralow thresholds. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.








Abstract
The realization of efficient on&#8208;chip microlasers with scalable fabrication, ultralow threshold, and stable single&#8208;frequency operation is always desired for a wide range of miniaturized photonic systems. Herein, an effective way to fabricate nanostructures&#8208; whispering&#8208;gallery&#8208;mode (WGM) lasers by drop&#8208;casting CdSe/CdS@Cd1&#8722;xZnxS core/buffer&#8208;shell@graded&#8208;shell nanoplatelets (NPLs) dispersion onto silica microspheres is presented. Benefiting from the excellent gain properties from the interface engineered core/hybrid shell NPLs and high&#8208;quality factor WGM resonator from excellent optical field confinement, the proposed room&#8208;temperature NPLs&#8208;WGM microlasers show a record&#8208;low lasing threshold of 3.26 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 under nanosecond laser pumping among all colloidal NPLs&#8208;based lasing demonstrations. The presence of sharp discrete transverse electric&#8208; and magnetic&#8208;mode spikes, the inversely proportional dependence of the free spectra range on microsphere sizes and the polarization anisotropy of laser output represent the first direct experimental evidence for NPLs&#8208;WGM lasing nature, which is verified theoretically by the computed electric&#8208;field distribution inside the microcavity. Remarkably, a stable single&#8208;mode lasing output with an ultralow lasing threshold of 3.84 &#181;J cm&#8722;2 is achieved by the Vernier effect through evanescent field coupling. The results highlight the significance of interface engineering on the optimization of gain properties of heterostructured nanomaterials and shed light on developing future miniaturized tunable coherent light sources.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength and Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogel Self&#8208;Assembled by Monomeric Nucleoside for Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously achieving high strength and injectability in one hydrogel is challenging. A high strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)). Notably, it exhibits excellent biocompatibility, fast biodegradation, antibacterial property, and osteoclast inhibition, making it a potential candidate biomaterial for tooth&#8208;extraction wound healing and tissue engineering.








Abstract
Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in biomedical and tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system, a high&#8208;strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is successfully fabricated. It is constructed by the self&#8208;assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2&#8208;amino&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2&#8242;&#8208;deoxyadenosine (2&#8208;FA)) with distilled water/phosphate buffered saline as solvent. Its storage modulus reaches 1 MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the strongest supramolecular hydrogel comprising an ultralow&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (MW &lt; 300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent shear&#8208;thinning injectability, and completes the sol&#8211;gel transition in seconds after injection at 37 &#176;C. The multi&#8208;hydrogen&#8208;bonding system is essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH2 groups, water molecules, and 2&#8242;&#8208;F atoms. Furthermore, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity. When applied to rat molar extraction sockets, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge, the 2&#8208;FA hydrogel exhibits faster degradation and induces less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study provides ideas for proposing a multifunctional, high&#8208;strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.

         <title>Electrically Programmable Interfacial Adhesion for Ultrastrong Hydrogel Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroadhesion strategy capable of realizing ultrastrong and universal hydrogel bonding in an electrically programmable way is reported. With the synergistic effect of electric fields and entropy on hydrated ion diffusion, its peak adhesive strength can reach 1.2&#160;MPa. Further, a mechanoelectric coupling model is established to determine directional diffusion of the ions and resultant smart electroadhesion.








Abstract
Adjustable interfacial adhesion is of great significance in smart&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;related engineering fields. This study presents an electroadhesion strategy for universal and ultrastrong hydrogel bonding with electrically programmable strength. An ionic hydrogel containing lithium ions is designed to achieve hydrated&#8208;ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;mediated interfacial adhesion, where external electric fields are employed to precisely control spatiotemporal dynamics of the ion diffusion across ionic adhesion region (IAR). The hydrogel can realize a universal, ultrastrong, efficient, tough, reversible, and environmentally tolerant electroadhesion to diverse hydrogels, whose peak adhesion strength and interfacial adhesion toughness are as high as 1.2&#160;MPa and 3750 J m&#8722;2, respectively. With a mechanoelectric coupling model, the dominant role of the hydrated ions in IAR played in the interfacial electroadhesion is further quantitatively revealed. The proposed strategy opens a door for developing high&#8208;performance adhesion hydrogels with electrically programmable functions, which are indispensable for various emerging fields like flexible electronics and soft robotics.

         <title>A Fully Flexible Intelligent Thermal Touch Panel Based on Intrinsically Plastic Ag2S Semiconductor</title>

A fully flexible intelligent thermal touch panel based on the intrinsically plastic Ag2S semiconductor can well perceive finger touch signals in real&#8208;time and displays intelligent feed back of Chinese characters and letters on an app.








Abstract
Wearable touch panels, a typical flexible electronic device, can recognize and feed back the information of finger touch and movement. Excellent wearable touch panels are required to accurately and quickly monitor the signals of finger movement as well as the capacity of bearing various types of deformation. High&#8208;performance thermistor materials are one of the key functional components, but to date, a long&#8208;standing bottleneck is that inorganic semiconductors are typically brittle while the electrical properties of organic semiconductors are quite low. Herein, a high&#8208;performance flexible temperature sensor is reported by using plastic Ag2S with ultrahigh temperature coefficient of resistance of &#8722;4.7% K&#8722;1 and resolution of 0.05 K, and rapid response/recovery time of 0.11/0.11 s. Moreover, the temperature sensor shows excellent durability without performance damage or loss during force stimuli tests. In addition, a fully flexible intelligent touch panel composed of a 16 &#215; 10 Ag2S&#8208;film&#8208;based temperature sensor array, as well as a flexible printed circuit board and a deep&#8208;learning algorithm is designed for perceiving finger touch signals in real&#8208;time, and intelligent feedback of Chinese characters and letters on an app. These results strongly show that high&#8208;performance flexible inorganic semiconductors can be widely used in flexible electronics.

         <title>Heterometallic Benzenehexathiolato Coordination Nanosheets: Periodic Structure Improves Crystallinity and Electrical Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combination of copper and nickel ions in 2D coordination nanosheets based on benzenehexathiolato&#8208;metal complex motifs induces a periodic in&#8208;plane metal arrangement and a bilayer structure. This heterometallicity affords improved film crystallinity and thus higher electrical conductivities in comparison with the pristine ones, reaching up to 1300 S cm&#8722;1. This strategy expands the variation and function of coordination nanomaterials.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets are an emerging class of 2D, bottom&#8208;up materials having fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated, planar, graphite&#8208;like structures with high electrical conductivities. Since their discovery, great effort has been devoted to expand the variety of coordination nanosheets; however, in most cases, their low crystallinity in thick films hampers practical device applications. In this study, mixtures of nickel and copper ions are employed to fabricate benzenehexathiolato (BHT)&#8208;based coordination nanosheet films, and serendipitously, it is found that this heterometallicity preferentially forms a structural phase with improved film crystallinity. Spectroscopic and scattering measurements provide evidence for a bilayer structure with in&#8208;plane periodic arrangement of copper and nickel ions with the NiCu2BHT formula. Compared with homometallic films, heterometallic films exhibit more crystalline microstructures with larger and more oriented grains, achieving higher electrical conductivities reaching metallic behaviors. Low dependency of Seebeck coefficient on the mixing ratio of nickel and copper ions supports that the large variation in the conductivity data is not caused by change in the intrinsic properties of the films. The findings open new pathways to improve crystallinity and to tune functional properties of 2D coordination nanosheets.

         <title>Artificial Heterogeneous Interphase Layer with Boosted Ion Affinity and Diffusion for Na/K&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;life Na&#8208;metal and K&#8208;metal batteries are realized by development of a heterogeneous protective layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and Na2S (K2S) on the surface of Na (K) foil. Such layer possesses the advantages of excellent sodiophilicity/potassiophilicity, high Young's modulus, and high ionic conductivity, inhibiting the dendrite growth during the repeated Na (K) plating/stripping.








Abstract
Metallic Na (K) are considered a promising anode materials for Na&#8208;metal and K&#8208;metal batteries because of their high theoretical capacity, low electrode potential, and abundant resources. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na (K) dendrites severely damages the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interface, resulting in battery failure. Herein, a heterogeneous interface layer consisting of metal vanadium nanoparticles and sodium sulfide (potassium sulfide) is introduced on the surface of a Na (K) foil (i.e., Na2S/V/Na or K2S/V/K). Experimental studies and theoretical calculations indicate that a heterogeneous Na2S/V (K2S/V) protective layer can effectively improve Na (K)&#8208;ion adsorption and diffusion kinetics, inhibiting the growth of Na (K) dendrites during Na (K) plating/stripping. Based on the novel design of the heterogeneous layer, the symmetric Na2S/V/Na cell displays a long lifespan of over 1000 h in a carbonate&#8208;based electrolyte, and the K2S/V/K electrode can operate for over 1300 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 with a capacity of 0.5 mAh cm&#8211;2. Moreover, the Na full cell (Na3V2(PO4)3||Na2S/V/Na) exhibits a high energy density of 375&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 and a high power density of 23.5&#160;kW kg&#8211;1. The achievements support the development of heterogeneous protective layers for other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density metal batteries.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Regulation of Hydrogel Actuators by Autocatalytic Reaction Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel actuators made of polyacrylamide bilayer hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks are controlled by an autocatalytic front of thiols. This regulation enables an autonomous sequential actuation, gradual unrolling, and screwing. In addition, these actuators can activate each other in a relay fashion or switch an electrical circuit.








Abstract
Regulating hydrogel actuators with chemical reaction networks is instrumental for constructing life&#8208;inspired smart materials. Herein, hydrogel actuators are engineered that are regulated by the autocatalytic front of thiols. The actuators consist of two layers. The first layer, which is regular polyacrylamide hydrogel, is in a strained conformation. The second layer, which is polyacrylamide hydrogel with disulfide crosslinks, maintains strain in the first layer. When thiols released by the autocatalytic front reduce disulfide crosslinks, the hydrogel actuates by releasing the mechanical strain in the first layer. The autocatalytic front is sustained by the reaction network, which uses thiouronium salts, disulfides of &#946;&#8208;aminothiols, and maleimide as starting components. The gradual actuation by the autocatalytic front enables movements such as gradual unrolling, screwing, and sequential closing of &#8220;fingers.&#8221; This actuation also allows the transmission of chemical signals in a relay fashion and the conversion of a chemical signal to an electrical signal. Locations and times of spontaneous initiation of autocatalytic fronts can be preprogrammed in the spatial distribution of the reactants in the hydrogel. To approach the functionality of living matter, the actuators triggered by an autocatalytic front can be integrated into smart materials regulated by chemical circuits.

         <title>Star&#8208;Polymer&#8211;DNA Gels Showing Highly Predictable and Tunable Mechanical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA gels with predictable mechanical responses are developed using a star&#8208;polymer strategy and a pair of presimulated DNA sequences. The macroscopic stress&#8208;relaxation time of the DNA gel is connected directly to the microscopic lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over an extended time range from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. In addition, the DNA gels are spatially homogeneous, hysteresis&#8208;less, and self&#8208;healable.








Abstract
Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time&#8208;dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy.

&lt;p&gt;DNA gels with predictable mechanical responses are developed using a star-polymer strategy and a pair of presimulated DNA sequences. The macroscopic stress-relaxation time of the DNA gel is connected directly to the microscopic lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over an extended time range from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. In addition, the DNA gels are spatially homogeneous, hysteresis-less, and self-healable.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamically crosslinked gels are appealing materials for applications that require time-dependent mechanical responses. DNA duplexes are ideal crosslinkers for building such gels because of their excellent sequence addressability and flexible tunability in bond energy. However, the mechanical responses of most DNA gels are complicated and unpredictable. Here, a DNA gel with a highly homogeneous gel network and well predictable mechanical behaviors is demonstrated by using a pair of star-polymer&#8211;DNA precursors with presimulated DNA sequences showing the two-state transition. The melting curve analysis of the DNA gels reveals the good correspondence between the thermodynamic potentials of the DNA crosslinkers and the presimulated values by DNA calculators. Stress-relaxation tests and dissociation kinetics measurements show that the macroscopic relaxation time of the DNA gels is approximately equal to the lifetime of the DNA crosslinkers over 4 orders of magnitude from 0.1&#8211;2000&#160;s. Furthermore, a series of durability tests find the DNA gels are hysteresis-less and self-healable after the applications of repeated temperature and mechanical stimuli. These results demonstrate the great potential of star-polymer&#8211;DNA precursors for building gels with predictable and tunable viscoelastic properties, suitable for applications such as stress-response extracellular matrices, injectable solids, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Changing DNA&#8208;Linked Nanoparticle Films Dictated by Lateral and Vertical Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of top&#8208;down plasmonic photopatterning and bottom&#8208;up DNA&#8208;based self&#8208;assembly is used to fabricate free&#8208;standing nanoparticle films encoded with instructions for dynamic shape changes. The distinct plasmonic properties of the incorporated nanoparticles enable on&#8208;demand lateral patterning with 3D selectivity, which, in turn, allows for fine control over the structure and morphing actions of DNA&#8208;linked nanoparticle films.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly of nanoscale building blocks into complex nanostructures with controlled structural anisotropy can open up new opportunities for realizing active nanomaterials exhibiting spatiotemporal structural transformations. Here, a combination of bottom&#8208;up DNA&#8208;directed self&#8208;assembly and top&#8208;down photothermal patterning is adopted to fabricate free&#8208;standing nanoparticle films with vertical and lateral heterogeneity. This approach involves the construction of multicomponent plasmonic nanoparticle films by DNA&#8208;directed layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly, followed by on&#8208;demand lateral patterning by the direct photothermal writing method. The distinct plasmonic properties of nanospheres and nanorods constituting the multidomain films enable photopatterning in a selective domain with precisely controlled vertical depths. The photopatterned films exhibit complex morphing actions instructed by the lateral and vertical patterns inscribed in the film as well as the information carried in DNA.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural&#8208;color change behavior of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D human lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip microsystem, which allows for visual sensing and real&#8208;time monitoring of cellular mechanics, is presented. This model enables modeling of human lung disease, assessment of the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease phenotypes, and screening of drugs for potential therapeutics.








Abstract
Lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models hold great promise for disease modeling and drug screening. Herein, inspired by the iridescence phenomenon of soap bubbles, a novel biomimetic 3D microphysiological lung&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system with breathing visualization is presented. The system, with an array of pulmonary alveoli at the physiological scale, is constructed and coated with structural color materials. Cyclic deformation is induced by regular airflow, resembling the expansion and contraction of the alveoli during rhythmic breathing. As the deformation is accompanied with corresponding synchronous shifts in the structural color, the constructed system offers self&#8208;reporting of the cell mechanics and enables real&#8208;time monitoring of the cultivation process. Using this system, the dynamic relationships between the color atlas and disease symptoms, showing the essential role of mechanical stretching in the phenotypes of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, are investigated. These features make this human lung system ideal in biological study, disease monitoring, and drug discovery.

         <title>Electrical Tuning of Plasmonic Conducting Polymer Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically tunable conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are reported. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, gradual electrical tuning of their nano&#8208;optical response is demonstrated. This work opens for electrically tunable metasurfaces and takes important steps toward applications ranging from tunable flat metalenses and holograms to adaptable smart windows.








Abstract
Nanostructures of conventional metals offer manipulation of light at the nanoscale but are largely limited to static behavior due to fixed material properties. To develop the next frontier of dynamic nano&#8208;optics and metasurfaces, this study utilizes the redox&#8208;tunable optical properties of conducting polymers, as recently shown to be capable of sustaining plasmons in their most conducting oxidized state. Electrically tunable conducting polymer nano&#8208;optical antennas are presented, using nanodisks of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene:sulfate) (PEDOT:Sulf) as a model system. In addition to repeated on/off switching of the polymeric nanoantennas, the concept enables gradual electrical tuning of the nano&#8208;optical response, which was&#160;found to be related to the modulation of both density and mobility of the mobile polaronic charge carriers in the polymer. The resonance position of the PEDOT:Sulf nanoantennas can be conveniently controlled by disk size, here reported down to a wavelength of around 1270 nm. The presented concept may be used for electrically tunable metasurfaces, with tunable farfield as well as nearfield. The work thereby opens for applications ranging from tunable flat meta&#8208;optics to adaptable smart windows.

         <title>Realizing 19.05% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells by Progressively Improving Charge Extraction and Suppressing Charge Recombination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progressive improvement of charge extraction and suppression of charge recombination by side&#8208;chain engineering of Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), employing a ternary blend and introducing a volatilizable solid additive, fine&#8208;tunes the electronic properties of the NFAs and optimizes the morphology of the active layer and contributes to a record power conversion efficiency of 19.05% for single&#8208;junction polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Improving charge extraction and suppressing charge recombination are critically important to minimize the loss of absorbed photons and improve the device performance of polymer solar cells (PSCs). In this work, highly efficient PSCs are demonstrated by progressively improving the charge extraction and suppressing the charge recombination through the combination of side&#8208;chain engineering of new nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs), adopting ternary blends, and introducing volatilizable solid additives. The 2D side chains on BTP&#8208;Th induce a certain steric hindrance for molecular packing and phase separation, which is mitigated by fluorination of side chains on BTP&#8208;FTh. Moreover, by introducing two highly crystalline molecules as the second acceptor and volatilizable solid additive, respectively, into the BTP&#8208;FTh&#8208;based host blend, the molecular crystallinity is significantly improved and the blend morphology is finely optimized. As expected, enhanced charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination are progressively realized, contributing to the largely improved fill factor (FF) of the resultant devices. Accompanied by the enhanced open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc), a record high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.05% is realized finally.

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Amorphous Interfaces Coupling of CoSe2/CoP with Optimized d&#8208;Band Center and Boosted Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystalline&#8208;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction is prepared. Thanks to the synergistic&#8208;effect of heterojunction and amorphous structure, the electronic coupling at the interfaces has been significantly strengthened and the d&#8208;band center has been deeply tailored. It optimizes the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and reduces the kinetic barrier of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process, achieving excellent HER activity.








Abstract
Amorphous and heterojunction materials have been widely used in the field of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, the current used individual strategy still has limited effects. Hence efficient tailoring tactics with synergistic effect are highly desired. Herein, the authors have realized the deep optimization of catalytic activity by a constructing crystalline&#8211;amorphous CoSe2/CoP heterojunction. Benefiting from the strong electronic coupling at the interfaces, the d&#8208;band center of the material moves further down compared to its crystalline&#8211;crystalline counterpart, optimizing the valence state and the H adsorption of Co and lowering the kinetic barrier of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The heterojunction shows an overpotential of 65&#160;mV to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in the acidic medium. Besides, it also shows competitive properties in both neutral and basic media. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the catalytic activity through combining a crystalline and amorphous heterojunction, which can be implemented for other transition metal compound electrocatalysts.

Nanosprings
In article number 2108419, Ziyao Zhou, Houbing Huang, Yong Peng, Ming Liu, and co&#8208;workers report freestanding, epitaxial, ferroelectric nanosprings with superscalability, which provide insights regarding mechanical behaviors and domain evolution of ferroelectric oxide springs. The excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under coexisting axial and shear strains. The superstretchable, elastic, and recoverable oxide spring provides a novel platform to flexible electronics.

Solid Electrolyte Interphase
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a critical role in determining the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal anodes. However, viewing the SEI in batteries remains extremely challenging due to its supersensitivity to the electron beam under a microscope. In article number 2108252, Ju Li, Meng Gu, and co&#8208;workers develop an ultralow&#8208;dosage cryo&#8208;TEM protocol to directly visualize the SEI in 3D at different charging states, revealing surprising and fundamentally significant results for the SEI. The optimized chemo&#8208;mechanical properties of the SEI contribute significantly to the superior performances of Li&#8208;metal batteries.

Hydrogel Actuators
Biochemical circuits regulate the movement of living organisms. In article number 2106816,  Sergey N. Semenov and co&#8208;workers use a synthetic chemical reaction network based on thiols to regulate hydrogel actuators. The signal inducing the actuation is propagated by the autocatalytic front of the thiols. It can jump from one actuator to another or be initiated by the chemical circuit with preprogrammed delay.

Immunotherapy
In article number 2106350, Dan Peer and co&#8208;workers propose a strategy to boost chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by using a dual cell&#8208;targeted lipid nanotherapeutic boost. With this approach, chemo&#8208;induced immunogenic cancer cell death is increased, tumor myeloid cell is reprogrammed, and cytotoxic T cell is recruited, which consequently improves responsiveness to immunotherapy.

         <title>Theory of Chirality Induced Spin Selectivity: Progress and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), namely phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts spin selectivity to various electron processes, has long defied a comprehensive theoretical explanation. Here, the status of CISS in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions is reviewed. For each, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is discussed and remaining challenges are identified.








Abstract
A critical overview of the theory of the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, that is, phenomena in which the chirality of molecular species imparts significant spin selectivity to various electron processes, is provided. Based on discussions in a recently held workshop, and further work published since, the status of CISS effects&#8212;in electron transmission, electron transport, and chemical reactions&#8212;is reviewed. For each, a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in theoretical understanding is provided and remaining challenges and research opportunities are identified.

         <title>Cellular Nanosponges for Biological Neutralization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely cellular nanosponges, as host cell decoys for biological neutralization applications is reviewed, including their use to neutralize bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. For each area, the design of different cellular nanosponges and their corresponding neutralization functions are discussed.








Abstract
Biological neutralization represents a general strategy that deploys therapeutic agents to bind with harmful molecules or infectious pathogens, block their bioactivity, and thus prevent them from causing the diseases. Here, a comprehensive review of using cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles, namely &#8220;cellular nanosponges,&#8221; as host decoys for a wide range of biological neutralization applications is provided. Compared to traditional neutralization strategies, the cellular nanosponges stand out by mimicking susceptible host cells rather than accommodating the structures of the causative agents for the design of therapeutics. As all pathological agents must interact with host cells for bioactivity, nanosponges bypass the diversity of these agents and create function&#8208;driven and broad&#8208;spectrum neutralization solutions. The review focuses on the recent progress of using this new nanomedicine platform for neutralization against five primary pathological agents, including bacterial toxins, chemical toxicants, inflammatory cytokines, pathological antibodies, and viruses. Existing studies have established cellular nanosponges as versatile tools for biological neutralization. A thorough review of the cellular nanosponge technology is expected to inspire more refined cellular nanosponge designs and unique neutralization applications to address unsolved medical problems.

         <title>Efficiency of Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 13, April 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. An important contribution to the EQE of a PLED orignates from triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA). Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in a PPV&#8208;based PLED, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.








Abstract
The various contributions to the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) are discussed. The EQE of an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is governed by a number of parameters, such as the electrical efficiency, the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), the optical outcoupling efficiency and the spin statistics for singlet exciton generation. In the last decade, the electrical efficiency has been determined from a numerical PLED device model. More recently, an optical model to simulate the fraction of photons outcoupled to air for PLEDs with a broad recombination zone has been developed. Together with the directly measured PLQY, the EQE of a PLED can then be estimated. However, it has been observed that the measured EQEs of fluorescent PLEDs, including the model system super&#8208;yellow poly(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (SY&#8208;PPV) often exceed the expected values. To solve this discrepancy, it is demonstrate that the electrical PLED model has to be expanded by the inclusion of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA), which is shown to be responsible for a substantial EQE enhancement. Experimentally, it is obtained that TTA contributes to a singlet&#8208;exciton generation efficiency of &#8776;40% in SY&#8208;PPV PLEDs, giving rise to an EQE of &#8776;4% instead of the expected value of 2.5%.

This review briefly introduces preparation methods, oxidation mechanisms, a comprehensive summarization of factors affecting oxidation and a detailed account of strategies to mitigate MXenes degeneration. It furthermore offers an overview of in situ synthesis MXene derivatives with enhanced performance, and presents perspectives for the challenges and opportunities for the protection and application of MXenes and their derivatives.








Abstract
As an emerging star of 2D nanomaterials, 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, named MXenes, present a large potential in various research areas owing to their intrinsic multilayer structure and intriguing physico&#8208;chemical properties. However, the fabrication and application of functional MXene&#8208;based devices still remain challenging as they are prone to oxidative degradation under ambient environment. Within this review, the preparation methods of MXenes focusing on the recent investigations on their thermal structure&#8211;stability relationships in inert, oxidizing, and aqueous environments are systematically introduced. Moreover, the key factors that affect the oxidation of MXenes, such as, atmosphere, temperature, composition, microstructure, and aqueous environment, are reviewed. Based on different scenarios, strategies for avoiding or delaying the oxidation of MXenes are proposed to encourage the utilization of MXenes in complicated environments, especially at high temperature. Furthermore, the chemistry of MXene&#8208;derived oxides is analyzed, which can offer perspectives on the further design and fabrication of novel 2D composites with the unique structures of MXenes being preserved.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Dendrimers that Underpin High&#8208;efficiency Host&#8208;Free Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed OLEDs remains a challenge. An effective solution highlighted in the present work is the use of highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimers as emitters. Here, we report the design, synthesis, DFT modelling and photophysics of three triazine&#8208;based dendrimers, tBuCz2pTRZ, tBuCz2mTRZ and tBuCz2m2pTRZ, which resolve the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small &#916;EST and a large oscillator strength by incorporating both a meta&#8208; and para&#8208; connected donor dendrons about a central triazine acceptor. The solution&#8208;processed OLED containing a host&#8208;free emitting layer exhibits an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.7%, a current efficiency of 98.8&#160;cd A&#8211;1 and a power efficiency of 91.3&#160;lm W&#8211;1. The device emits with an electroluminescence maximum, &#955;EL, of 540&#160;nm and Commission International de l&#8217;&#201;clairage (CIE) color coordinates of (0.37, 0.57). This represents the most efficient host&#8208;free solution processed OLED reported to date. Further optimization directed at improving the charge balance within the device resulted in an emissive layer also containing 30 wt% OXD&#8208;7, which led to an OLED with similar EQEmax of 28.4% but showing a significantly improved efficiency roll&#8208;off where the EQE remained high at 22.7% at a luminance of 500&#160;cd m&#8211;2.

         <title>Giant spin Hall effect and spin&#8208;orbit torques in 5d transition metal &#8211; aluminum alloys from extrinsic scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The generation of spin currents from charge currents via the spin Hall effect is both of fundamental and technological interest. Here we show some of the largest spin Hall effects yet observed via extrinsic scattering in a large class of binary compounds formed from a 5d element and aluminum with a giant spin Hall angle of &#8764; 1 in the compound Os22Al78. We find a critical composition of the 5d element where there is a structural phase boundary between poorly and highly textured crystalline material, where the spin Hall angle takes a maximum value. Furthermore, we find a systematic increase in the spin Hall conductivity and the spin Hall angle at this critical composition as the atomic number of the 5d element is systematically increased. This clearly shows that the spin Hall effect and spin Hall conductivity are derived from extrinsic scattering mechanisms related to the potential mismatch between the 5d element and Al. These studies show the importance of extrinsic mechanisms derived from potential mismatch as a route to obtaining large spin Hall angles with high technological impact. Indeed, we demonstrate that a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art racetrack device has a several&#8208;fold increased current induced domain wall efficiency using these materials as compared to prior&#8208;art materials.

         <title>Unconventional spin pumping and magnetic damping in an insulating compensated ferrimagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, the interest in spin pumping has escalated from ferromagnets into antiferromagnetic systems, potentially enabling fundamental physics and magnonic applications. Compensated ferrimagnets are considered alternative platforms for bridging ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnets, but their spin pumping and the associated magnetic damping have been largely overlooked so far despite their seminal importance for magnonics. Herein, we report an unconventional spin pumping together with magnetic damping in an insulating compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12. Remarkably, we unambiguously identified the divergence of the nonlocal effective magnetic damping induced by spin pumping close to the compensation temperature in Gd3Fe5O12/Cu/Pt heterostructures. Furthermore, the coherent and incoherent spin currents, generated by spin pumping and spin Seebeck effect respectively, undergo a distinct direction change with the variation of temperature. The physical mechanisms underlying these observations are self&#8208;consistently clarified by the ferrimagnetic counterpart of spin pumping and the handedness&#8208;related spin&#8208;wave spectra. Our findings broaden the conventional paradigm of the ferromagnetic spin pumping model and open new opportunities for exploring the ferrimagnetic magnonic devices.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Based Membranes for Safe Lithium/Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Alkali (lithium, sodium)&#8208;based second batteries are considered as one of the brightest candidates for energy storage applications in order to utilize the random and intermittent renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality. Conventional lithium/sodium batteries containing liquid organic electrolytes are vulnerable to electrolytes leakage and even combustion, which hinders their large&#8208;scale and reliable application. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes which are considered to have better safety have been developed in recent years. However, most of them suffer from low ionic conductivity and large interfacial resistance with the electrode. Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices, have attracted much attention because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. This review focuses on the most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes that sprang up with the emerging demand and progress of safe lithium/sodium batteries. The ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes are discussed based on the framework components and preparation methods. Their structure and properties, including ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, electrochemical stabilities, and so on, are demonstrated in combination with their applications. The current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are also proposed.

         <title>Dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors based on self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolytes for reconfigurable electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Reconfigurable organic logic devices are promising candidates for next generations of efficient computing systems and adaptive electronics. Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, power efficient, and compatible with high&#8208;throughput microfabrication techniques. In this work, we report an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) that are described here for the first time. These transistors employ a self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which allows our transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi&#8208;device engineering. We show that the dual&#8208;mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. We develop a device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these dual&#8208;mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly.

Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, power efficient, and compatible with high-throughput microfabrication techniques. In this work, we report an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual-mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) that are described here for the first time. These transistors employ a self-doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which allows our transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi-device engineering. We show that the dual-mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. We develop a device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of these dual-mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two&#8208;pronged Intracellular Co&#8208;delivery of Antigen and Adjuvant for Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Nanovaccines have emerged as promising alternatives or complements to conventional cancer treatments. Despite the progresses, specific co&#8208;delivery of antigen and adjuvant to their corresponding intracellular destinations for maximizing the activation of antitumor immune responses remains a challenge. Herein, we developed a lipid&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticle as nanovaccine (IONP&#8208;C/O@LP) that could co&#8208;deliver peptide antigen and adjuvant (CpG DNA) into cytosol and lysosomes of dendritic cells (DCs) through both membrane fusion and endosome&#8208;mediated endocytosis. Such two&#8208;pronged cellular uptake pattern enabled IONP&#8208;C/O@LP to synergistically activate immature DCs. Iron oxide nanoparticle also exhibited adjuvant effects by generating intracellular reactive oxygen species, which further promoted DC maturation. IONP&#8208;C/O@LP accumulated in the DCs of draining lymph nodes effectively increased the antigen&#8208;specific T cells in both tumor and spleen, inhibited tumor growth, and improved animal survival. Moreover, we have demonstrated that this nanovaccine is a general platform of delivering clinically relevant peptide antigens derived from human papilloma virus 16 to trigger antigen&#8208;specific immune responses in vivo.

         <title>Triboresistive Touch Sensing: Grid&#8208;Free Touch&#8208;Point Recognition Based on Monolayered Ionic Power Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of sensing, termed &#8220;triboresistive touch sensing&#8221;, is developed for self&#8208;powered gridless touch&#8208;position recognition. An ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) exhibiting high transmittance (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), resilience (99.0%), and ionic conductivity (0.25 mS m&#8722;1) is designed to generate power based on an electric field induced by touch. The voltages ensure sensing the touch positions without electrode grids and external power sources.








Abstract
Recent growing pursuit of skin&#8208;mountable devices has been impeded by the complicated structures of most sensing systems, containing electrode grids, stacked multilayers, and even external power sources. Here, a type of touch sensing, termed &#8220;triboresistive touch sensing&#8221;, is introduced for gridless touch recognition based on monolayered ionic power generators. A homogeneous monolayer, i.e., ionic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), generates electricity based on the electric field generated by touch. Voltages generated at each corner of the ionic PDMS rely on resistance between touch points and each corner, ensuring recognition of the touch positions without the need for electrode grid layers and external power sources. With notable advantages of high transparency (96.5%), stretchability (539.1%), and resilience (99.0%) of the ionic PDMS, epidermal triboresistive sensing is demonstrated to express touch position and readily play a musical instrument. A gridless system of triboresistive sensing allows rearrangement of the touch sections according to a given situation without any physical modification, and thus easily completes consecutive missions of controlling position, orientation, and gripping functions of a robot.

         <title>Understanding Heterogeneities in Quantum Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterogeneities such as defects, impurities, edges, interfaces, and disorder often define and affect the coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topology of quantum states. Their roles in quantum materials are examined at the atomistic level by revealing the different degrees of freedom of heterogeneities, understanding their effects on the host material, and controlling heterogeneities to create new materials with tailored quantum functions.








Abstract
Quantum materials are usually heterogeneous, with structural defects, impurities, surfaces, edges, interfaces, and disorder. These heterogeneities are sometimes viewed as liabilities within conventional systems; however, their electronic and magnetic structures often define and affect the quantum phenomena such as coherence, interaction, entanglement, and topological effects in the host system. Therefore, a critical need is to understand the roles of heterogeneities in order to endow materials with new quantum functions for energy and quantum information science applications. In this article, several representative examples are reviewed on the recent progress in connecting the heterogeneities to the quantum behaviors of real materials. Specifically, three intertwined topic areas are assessed: i) Reveal the structural, electronic, magnetic, vibrational, and optical degrees of freedom of heterogeneities. ii) Understand the effect of heterogeneities on the behaviors of quantum states in host material systems. iii) Control heterogeneities for new quantum functions. This progress is achieved by establishing the atomistic&#8208;level structure&#8208;property relationships associated with heterogeneities in quantum materials. The understanding of the interactions between electronic, magnetic, photonic, and vibrational states of heterogeneities enables the design of new quantum materials, including topological matter and quantum light emitters based on heterogenous 2D materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin membranes have undergone rapid development for fast and precise separations in the past 15 years. Here, a review is given on the assembly, structure, materials, and transport of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm membranes, with a focus on their fabrication&#8208;structure&#8208;transport relationships. Applications for liquid and gas separations are analyzed and compared to provide insights for future advances in high&#8208;performance membranes.








Abstract
Ultrathin membranes are at the forefront of membrane research, offering great opportunities in revolutionizing separations with ultrafast transport. Driven by advanced nanomaterials and manufacturing technology, tremendous progresses are made over the last 15 years in the fabrications and applications of sub&#8208;50&#160;nm membranes. Here, an overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ultrathin membranes is first introduced, followed by a summary of the fabrication techniques with an emphasis on how to realize such extremely low thickness. Then, different types of ultrathin membranes, categorized based on their structures, that is, network, laminar, or framework structures, are discussed with a focus on the interplays among structure, fabrication methods, and separation performances. Recent research and development trends are highlighted. Meanwhile, the performances and applications of current ultrathin membranes for representative separations (gas separation and liquid separation) are thoroughly analyzed and compared. Last, the challenges in material design, structure construction, and coordination are given, in order to fully realize the potential of ultrathin membranes and facilitate the translation from scientific achievements to industrial productions.

         <title>Wearable Pressure Sensors for Pulse Wave Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current advances of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring are presented, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves, the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, as well as opportunities and challenges are also concluded.








Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death worldwide. The rapid development of flexible sensing technologies and wearable pressure sensors have attracted keen research interest and have been widely used for long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time cardiovascular status monitoring. Owing to compelling characteristics, including light weight, wearing comfort, and high sensitivity to pulse pressures, physiological pulse waveforms can be precisely and continuously monitored by flexible pressure sensors for wearable health monitoring. Herein, an overview of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring is presented, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. The conceptualizations and methods for the acquisition of physiological and pathological information related to the cardiovascular system are outlined. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves and the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, including triboelectric, piezoelectric, magnetoelastic, piezoresistive, capacitive, and optical sensors, are also subject to systematic debate. Exemple applications of pulse wave measurement based on microengineering structured devices are then summarized. Finally, a discussion of the opportunities and challenges that wearable pressure sensors face, as well as their potential as a wearable intelligent system for personalized healthcare is given in conclusion.

Herein, an overview of wearable pressure sensors for human pulse wave monitoring is presented, with a focus on the transduction mechanism, microengineering structures, and related applications in pulse wave monitoring and cardiovascular condition assessment. The conceptualizations and methods for the acquisition of physiological and pathological information related to the cardiovascular system are outlined. The biomechanics of arterial pulse waves and the working mechanism of various wearable pressure sensors, including triboelectric, piezoelectric, magnetoelastic, piezoresistive, capacitive, and optical sensors, are also subject to systematic debate. Exemple applications of pulse wave measurement based on microengineering structured devices are then summarized. Finally, a discussion of the opportunities and challenges that wearable pressure sensors face, as well as their potential as a wearable intelligent system for personalized healthcare is given in conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unveiling the Interaction Mechanisms of Electron and X&#8208;ray Radiation with Halide Perovskite Semiconductors using Scanning Nanoprobe Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;resolution microscopy using nanoprobe diffraction reveals spatially resolved changes in the local crystal structure of halide perovskite films upon irradiation with high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;rays. High&#8208;angle defective grain boundaries trigger the formation of degradation phases, leading to changes in the crystal structure. Targeting high&#8208;angle grain boundaries is critical for film stability under high&#8208;energy radiation conditions, especially for space photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
The interaction of high&#8208;energy electrons and X&#8208;ray photons with beam&#8208;sensitive semiconductors such as halide perovskites is essential for the characterization and understanding of these optoelectronic materials. Using nanoprobe diffraction techniques, which can investigate physical properties on the nanoscale, studies of the interaction of electron and X&#8208;ray radiation with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art (FA0.79MA0.16Cs0.05)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 hybrid halide perovskite films (FA, formamidinium; MA, methylammonium) are performed, tracking the changes in the local crystal structure as a function of fluence using scanning electron diffraction and synchrotron nano X&#8208;ray diffraction techniques. Perovskite grains are identified, from which additional reflections, corresponding to PbBr2, appear as a crystalline degradation phase after fluences of 200 e&#8722; &#197;&#8722;2. These changes are concomitant with the formation of small PbI2 crystallites at the adjacent high&#8208;angle grain boundaries, with the formation of pinholes, and with a phase transition from tetragonal to cubic. A similar degradation pathway is caused by photon irradiation in nano&#8208;X&#8208;ray diffraction, suggesting common underlying mechanisms. This approach explores the radiation limits of these materials and provides a description of the degradation pathways on the nanoscale. Addressing high&#8208;angle grain boundaries will be critical for the further improvement of halide polycrystalline film stability, especially for applications vulnerable to high&#8208;energy radiation such as space photovoltaics.

         <title>White&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven Resonant Emission from a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk gain media, large&#8208;dimensional resonant cavities, and sizable focusing apparatuses seriously limit the application scope of solar&#8208;powered light sources. Particularly, the miniaturization of solar&#8208;driven photon emitters remains challenging. Here resonant emission from monolayer semiconductor under simulated solar illumination by a white&#8208;light emitting diode is demonstrated, which represents an exciting step toward on&#8208;chip solar&#8208;powered photonic circuits.








Abstract
Resonant emission in photonic structures is very useful to construct all&#8208;photonic circuits for optical interconnects and quantum computing. Optical generation of most resonant&#8208;emitting modes in photonic structures is obtained by coherent pumping rather than incoherent illumination. Particularly, the development of white&#8208;light&#8208; or even solar&#8208;powered on&#8208;chip light sources remains challenging but is very attractive in view of the much facile availability of these incoherent excitation sources. Here, net resonant emission from a monolayer semiconductor is demonstrated under simulated solar illumination by a white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode. The device is formed by embedding a 2D gain medium into a planar microcavity on a silicon wafer, which is compatible with the prevailing on&#8208;chip photonic technology. Coherent and white&#8208;light excitation sources are, respectively, selected for optical pumping, where the output light in two cases exhibits well&#8208;consistent resonant wavelength, linewidth, polarization, location, and Gaussian&#8208;beam profile. The fundamental TEM00 mode behaves as a doublet emission, resulting from anisotropy&#8208;induced non&#8208;degenerate states with orthogonal polarizations. The extraordinary spectral flipping is attributed to the competitive interplay of resonant absorption and emission. This work paves a way toward white&#8208;light or solar&#8208;powered state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photonic applications at the chip scale.

         <title>Selenopeptide Nanomedicine Activates Natural Killer Cells for Enhanced Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanomedicine is developed to strengthen chemoimmunotherapy through combing the programmable delivery of doxorubicin and the synergistic NK cell immunotherapy activated by oxidative seleno&#8208;metabolites. The xperimental results demonstrate the mutual promotion between the doxorubicin&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contribute to improved antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Chemoimmunotherapy using nanotechnology has shown great potential for cancer therapy in the clinic. However, uncontrolled transportation and synergistic responses remain challenges. Here, a self&#8208;assembled selenopeptide nanoparticle that strengthens tumor chemoimmunotherapy through the activation of natural killer (NK) cells by the oxidative metabolite of the selenopeptide is developed. With the advantages of the enzyme&#8208;induced size&#8208;reduction and the reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;driven deselenization, this selenopeptide is able to deliver therapeutics, e.g., doxorubicin (DOX), to solid tumors and further activate the NK cells in a programmed manner. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo results prove the mutual promotion between the DOX&#8208;induced chemotherapy and the selenopeptide&#8208;induced immunotherapy, which synergistically contribute to the improved antitumor efficacy. It is anticipated that the selenopeptide may provide a type of promising stimuli&#8208;responsive immune modulator for versatile biomedical applications.

         <title>Magnon&#8208;Coupled Intralayer Moir&#233; Trion in Monolayer Semiconductor&#8211;Antiferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; patterns of van der Waals heterostructures offer a powerful platform for engineering excitonic states, leading to the formation of moir&#233; excitonic states. However, interactions between moir&#233; excitonic states and magnetic elementary excitations are not studied. In this work, a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with an antiferromagnetic order in a monolayer MoSe2 and an antiferromagnetic MnPS3 heterostructure is reported.








Abstract
Moir&#233; fringe patterns created by stacking different 2D layered materials as artificial van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have become a novel platform to study and engineer optically generated excitonic properties. The moir&#233; patterns contribute to the formation of spatially ordered excitonic states (excitons and trions), which can be used in the quantum simulation of many&#8208;body systems and ensembles of coherent quantum light emitters. The intriguing moir&#233; excitonic properties are affected by and controlled via the interaction with magnetic elements. Here, a moir&#233; excitonic system interacting with the magnetic elementary excitation of antiferromagnetic orders in MoSe2/MnPS3 vdW heterostructures is reported. The low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence spectra with additional fine spectral structures on the low&#8208;energy side, which are coupled magnon&#8211;trion peaks below the N&#233;el temperature of MnPS3, are carefully investigated. The fine spectral structures with long lifetime and coherence time are assigned to intralayer trion&#8211;magnon complexes trapped in the moir&#233; potentials (moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes). These findings highlight the emergence of moir&#233; trion&#8211;magnon complexes and provide a new way to explore novel quantum phenomena in moir&#233; excitonic systems with magnetic functionalities.

         <title>Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a class of porous materials with crystal lattices, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), featuring an outstanding specific surface area, tunable functionality, and versatile structures, have attracted huge attention in the past two decades. Since the first conductive MOF was successfully synthesized in 2009, considerable progress has been achieved for the development of conductive MOFs, allowing their use in diverse applications for electrochemical energy storage. Among those applications, supercapacitors have received great interest because of their high power density, fast charging ability, and excellent cycling stability. In this review, we summarize the efforts hitherto devoted to the synthesis and design of conductive MOFs and their auspicious capacitive performance. Using conductive MOF as a unique platform medium, we discuss the electronic and molecular aspects of the energy storage mechanism in supercapacitors with MOF electrodes, highlighting the advantages and limitations to inspire new ideas for the development of conductive MOFs for supercapacitors.

         <title>Vertical Graphene&#8208;Reinforced Titanium Alloy Bipolar Plates in Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The bipolar plate (BP) serves as one of the crucial components in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Among BP materials, metallic BPs are widely employed due to their outstanding comprehensive properties. However, the interfacial contact resistance (ICR) between BP and gas diffusion layer together with corrosion of metallic BP under acidic operating conditions degrades the performance and stability of PEMFCs. Herein, we propose an approach to the surface reinforcement of titanium (Ti) alloy BPs, relying on a directly grown vertical graphene (VG) coating via plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method. Compared with bare Ti alloy, the corrosion rate of VG&#8208;coated Ti alloy reduces by 1&#8722;2 orders of magnitude in the simulated PEMFC operating environments and ICR decreases by &#8776;100 times, while its thermal conductivity improves by &#8776;20% and water contact angle increases by 68.1&#176;. The results can be interpreted that the unique structure of VG enables excellent electrical and thermal conduction in PEMFCs, and the highly hydrophobic VG coating suppresses the penetration of corrosive liquid as well as contributing to water management. This study opens a new opportunity to reinforce metallic surfaces by the robust and versatile VG coating for high&#8208;performance electrodes used in energy and catalyst applications.

         <title>Diminishing Interfacial Turbulence by Colloid&#8208;Polymer Electrolyte to Stabilize Zinc Ion Flux for Deep&#8208;Cycling Zn Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fluidity of aqueous electrolytes and undesired H2 evolution reaction (HER) can cause severe interfacial turbulence in aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) at deep cycling with high capacities and current densities, which would further perturb ion flux and aggravate Zn dendrite growth. In this study, a colloid&#8208;polymer electrolyte (CPE) with special colloidal phase and suppressed HER is designed to diminish interfacial turbulence and boost deep Zn electrochemistry. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the quantitative migratory barriers of Zn2+ along the transport pathway in CPE demonstrate much smaller fluctuations compared with normal aqueous electrolyte, indicating that CPE could effectively diminish interfacial disturbance. Benefitting from this, the Zn2+ ion flux could be homogenized and deposited evenly on the electrode, which is confirmed by finite element simulation and in situ Raman measurements. Consequently, CPE enables stable operation of Zn//Cu cells even with high capacity (up to 20 mAh cm&#8211;2) and current density (up to 100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2) and Zn//Na5V12O32 full&#8208;cell with N/P ratio as low as 1 (i.e., 100%&#160;Zn utilization). We believe that this strategy opens a brand&#8208;new avenue based on CPE toward boosting deep&#8208;cycling electrochemistry in ZMBs and even other aqueous energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Rapidly and Repeatedly Reprogrammable Liquid Crystalline Elastomer via a Shape Memory Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Realization of muscle&#8208;like actuation for a liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) requires mesogen alignment, which is typically achieved/fixed chemically during the synthesis. Post&#8208;synthesis regulation of the alignment in a convenient and repeatable manner is highly desirable yet challenging. Here we design and synthesize a dual&#8208;phase LCE network with a crystalline melting transition above a liquid crystalline transition. The crystalline phase can serve as an &#8220;alignment frame&#8221; to fix any mechanical deformation via a shape memory mechanism, leading to corresponding mesogen alignment in the liquid crystalline phase. The alignment can be erased by melting, which can be the starting point for reprogramming. This strategy that relies on a physical shape memory transition for mesogen alignment permits repeated reprogramming in a timescale of seconds, in stark contrast to typical methods. It further leads to unusual versatility in designing 3D printed LCE with unlimited programmable actuation modes.

         <title>Glutathione&#8208;Depleting Organic Metal Adjuvants for Effective NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Although photothermal immunotherapy (PTI) is a compelling strategy for tumor therapy, the development of promising photothermal agents to overcome the insufficient immunogenicity of tumor cells and the poor immune response encountered in PTI is still challenging. Herein, we present commercial small&#8208;molecule&#8208;based organic metal adjuvants (OMAs) with second near&#8208;infrared photoacoustic and photothermal properties as well as the ability to perturb redox homeostasis to potentiate immunogenicity and immune responsiveness. OMAs, assembled from charge&#8208;transfer complexes and characterized by a broad substrate scope, high accessibility, and flexibly tuned optical properties, demonstrate strong phototherapeutic and adjuvant abilities via the depletion of glutathione and cysteine, and subsequently elicit systemic immunity by evoking immunogenic cell death, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing T cell infiltration. Furthermore, programmed cell death protein 1 antibody can be employed to synergize with OMAs to suppress tumor immune evasion and ultimately improve the treatment outcomes. This study unlocks new paradigms to provide a versatile OMA&#8208;based scaffold for future practical applications.

Abstract
Developing zero&#8208;strain electrode materials with high capacity is crucial for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Here, we report a new zero&#8208;strain composite material made of ultrasmall Si nanodots (NDs) within metal organic framework&#8208;derived nanoreactors (Si NDs&#8834;MDN) through a novel space&#8208;confined catalytic strategy. The unique Si NDs&#8834;MDN anode features a low strain (&lt; 3%) and a high theoretical lithium storage capacity (1524 mAh g&#8211;1) which far surpasses the traditional single&#8208;crystal counterparts that suffer from a low capacity delivery. The zero&#8208;strain property has been evidenced by substantial characterizations including ex/in situ transmission electron microscopy and mechanical simulations. The Si NDs&#8834;MDN exhibits superior cycling stability and high reversible capacity (1327 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1 after 100 cycles) in half cells and high energy density (366&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 after 300 cycles) in a full cell. This study reports a new catalog of zero&#8208;strain electrode material with significantly improved capacity beyond the traditional single&#8208;crystal zero&#8208;strain materials.

         <title>Biobased Elastomer Nanofibers Guide Light&#8208;Controlled Human&#8208;iPSC&#8208;Derived Skeletal Myofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elastomeric nanofiber sheets, made from a new biobased nanohybrid polymer, support the differentiation and contractile function of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived skeletal muscle fibers. The controlled alignment of nanofibers provides extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like guidance, promoting myofiber differentiation and maturation. The hyperelastic properties of the elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically activate contractions and promote culture longevity.








Abstract
Generating skeletal muscle tissue that mimics the cellular alignment, maturation, and function of native skeletal muscle is an ongoing challenge in disease modeling and regenerative therapies. Skeletal muscle cultures require extracellular guidance and mechanical support to stabilize contractile myofibers. Existing microfabrication&#8208;based solutions are limited by complex fabrication steps, low throughput, and challenges in measuring dynamic contractile function. Here, the synthesis and characterization of a new biobased nanohybrid elastomer, which is electrospun into aligned nanofiber sheets to mimic the skeletal muscle extracellular matrix, is presented. The polymer exhibits remarkable hyperelasticity well&#8208;matched to that of native skeletal muscle (&#8776;11&#8211;50&#160;kPa), with ultimate strain &#8776;1000%, and elastic modulus &#8776;25&#160;kPa.&#160;Uniaxially aligned nanofibers guide myoblast alignment, enhance sarcomere formation, and promote a &#8776;32% increase in myotube fusion and &#8776;50% increase in myofiber maturation. The elastomer nanofibers stabilize optogenetically&#160;controlled human induced pluripotent stem cell derived skeletal myofibers. When activated by blue light, the myofiber&#8211;nanofiber hybrid constructs maintain a significantly higher (&gt;200%) contraction velocity and specific force (&gt;280%) compared to conventional culture methods. The engineered myofibers exhibit a power density of &#8776;35&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;3. This system is a promising new skeletal muscle tissue model for applications in muscular disease modeling, drug discovery, and muscle regeneration.

         <title>Large Magnetic Gap in a Designer Ferromagnet&#8211;Topological Insulator&#8211;Ferromagnet Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferromagnet/topological insulator heterostructure is fabricated comprising a sandwich structure of 2D ferromagnetic insulators with an ultrathin topological insulator in the middle. The ferromagnets induce magnetic order in the topological insulator via magnetic proximity leading to a quantum anomalous Hall insulator and large 75 meV magnetic bandgap. These findings reveal a promising platform for lossless transport applications at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Combining magnetism and nontrivial band topology gives rise to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators and exotic quantum phases such as the QAH effect where current flows without dissipation along quantized edge states. Inducing magnetic order in topological insulators via proximity to a magnetic material offers a promising pathway toward achieving the QAH effect at a high temperature for lossless transport applications. One promising architecture involves a sandwich structure comprising two single&#8208;septuple layers (1SL) of MnBi2Te4 (a 2D ferromagnetic insulator) with ultrathin few quintuple layer (QL) Bi2Te3 in the middle, and it is predicted to yield a robust QAH insulator phase with a large bandgap greater than 50 meV. Here, the growth of a 1SL MnBi2Te4/4QL Bi2Te3/1SL MnBi2Te4 heterostructure via molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated and the electronic structure probed using angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Strong hexagonally warped massive Dirac fermions and a bandgap of 75 &#177; 15 meV are observed. The magnetic origin of the gap is confirmed by the observation of the exchange&#8208;Rashba effect, as well as the vanishing bandgap above the Curie temperature, in agreement with density functional theory calculations. These findings provide insights into magnetic proximity effects in topological insulators and reveal a promising platform for realizing the QAH effect at elevated temperatures.

         <title>High&#8208;Precision Micropatterning of Polydopamine by Multiphoton Lithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine serves as a versatile platform for facile functionalization applicable to almost any surface. In this work, a novel approach of polydopamine deposition applying multiphoton lithography is introduced, resulting in 2D microstructures of complex designs with adjustable morphology and thickness. Reaching sub&#8208;micrometer pattern precision, this approach does not require photomasks or stamps and enables full spatial deposition control.








Abstract
Mussel&#8208;inspired polydopamine (PDA) initiates a multifunctional modification route that leads to the generation of novel advanced materials and their applications. However, existing PDA deposition techniques still exhibit poor spatial control, have a very limited capability of micropatterning, and do not allow local tuning of the PDA topography. Herein, PDA deposition based on multiphoton lithography (MPL) is demonstrated, which enables full spatial and temporal control with nearly total freedom of patterning design. Using MPL, 2D microstructures of complex design are achieved with pattern precision of 0.8&#160;&#181;m without the need of a photomask or stamp. Moreover, this approach permits adjusting the morphology and thickness of the fabricated microstructure within one deposition step, resulting in a unique tunability of material properties. The chemical composition of PDA is confirmed and its ability for protein enzyme immobilization is demonstrated. This work presents a new methodology for high&#8208;precision and complete control of PDA deposition, enabling PDA incorporation in applications where fine and precise local surface functionalization is required. Possible applications include multicomponent functional elements and devices in microfluidics or lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.

         <title>A Semiconducting Two&#8208;dimensional Polymer as an Organic Electrochemical Transistor Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are devices with broad potential in bioelectronic sensing, circuits, and neuromorphic hardware. Their unique properties arise from the use of organic mixed ionic/electronic conductors (OMIECs) as the active channel. Typical OMIECs are linear polymers, where defined and controlled microstructure/morphology, and reliable characterization of transport and charging can be elusive. Semiconducting two&#8208;dimensional polymers (2DPs) present a new avenue in OMIEC materials development, enabling electronic transport along with precise control of well&#8208;defined channels ideal for ion transport/intercalation. To this end, a recently reported 2DP, TIIP, is synthesized and patterned at 10&#160;&#956;m resolution as the channel of a transistor. The TIIP films demonstrate textured microstructure and show semiconducting properties with accessible oxidation states. Operating in aqueous electrolyte, the 2DP&#8208;OECT exhibits a device&#8208;scale hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and a &#956;C* figure of merit of 1.75 F cm&#8211;1 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1. 2DP OMIECs thus offer new synthetic degrees of freedom to control OECT performance and may enable additional opportunities such as ion selectivity or improved stability through reduced morphological modulation during device operation.

Abstract
Tissue culture ware polystyrene is the gold standard for in vitro cell culture. While microengineering techniques can create advanced cell microenvironments in polystyrene, they require specialized equipment and reagents, which hinder their accessibility for most biological researchers. We developed and validated an economical and easily accessible method for fabricating microstructures directly in polystyrene with sizes approaching subcellular dimensions while requiring minimal processing time. The process involves deep ultraviolet irradiation through a shadow mask or ink pattern using inexpensive, handheld devices followed by selective chemical development with common reagents to generate micropatterns with depths/heights between 5&#8211;10&#160;&#956;m, which can be used to guide cell behavior. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

         <title>Ionic Hydrogel for Efficient and Scalable Moisture&#8208;Electric Generation</title>

Abstract
The progress of spontaneous energy generation from ubiquitous moisture has been hindered the low output current and intermittent operating voltage of the moisture&#8208;electric generators. Herein we develop a novel and efficient ionic hydrogel moisture&#8208;electric generator (IHMEG) by rational combination of poly(vinyl alcohol), phytic acid and glycerol&#8208;water binary solvent. Thanks to the synergistic effect of notable moisture&#8208;absorption capability and fast ion transport capability in the ionic hydrogel network, a single IHMEG unit of 0.25 cm2 can continuously generate direct&#8208;current electricity with a constant open&#8208;circuit voltage of &#8764;0.8&#160;V for over 1000 hours, a high short&#8208;current density of 0.24 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 and power density of up to 35 &#956;W&#183;cm&#8211;2. Of great importance is that large&#8208;scale integration of IHMEG units can be readily accomplished to offer a device with voltage up to 210&#160;V, capable of directly driving numerous commercial electronics, including electronic ink screen, metal electrodeposition setup and light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diode arrays. Such prominent performance is mainly attributed to the enhanced moisture&#8208;liberated proton diffusion proved by experimental observation and theoretical analysis. The ionic hydrogel with high cost&#8208;efficiency, easy&#8208;to&#8208;scaleup fabrication and high power&#8208;output opens a brand&#8208;new perspective to develop a green, versatile and efficient power source for Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and wearable electronics.

         <title>Coupling Lipid Nanoparticle Structure and Automated Single Particle Composition Analysis to Design Phospholipase Responsive Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are versatile structures with tunable physicochemical properties that are ideally suited as a platform for vaccine delivery and RNA therapeutics. A key barrier to LNP rational design is the inability to relate composition and structure to intracellular processing and function. Here we&#160;combine Single Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA&#174;) with small angle scattering (SAXS / SANS) techniques to link LNP composition with internal structure and morphology and to monitor dynamic LNP &#8208; phospholipase D (PLD) interactions. Our&#160;analysis demonstrates that phospholipase D, a key intracellular trafficking mediator, can access the entire LNP lipid membrane to generate stable, anionic LNPs. PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate was&#160;an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions. This represents an opportunity to design enzyme&#8208;responsive LNP solutions for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery and diseases where PLD is dysregulated.&#160;

         <title>Photoexcitation Dynamics and Long&#8208;lived Excitons in Strain&#8208;engineered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has garnered intense research interest in tailoring the optical properties via strain&#8208;induced modifications of the electronic&#8208;bands in TMDs, while its impact on the exciton dynamics remains less understood. To address this, we perform an extensive study of transient optical absorption (TA) of both W&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;crystalline monolayer TMDs grown by a recently developed laser&#8208;assisted evaporation method. All spectral features of the monolayers as grown on fused silica substrates exhibit appreciable red shifts relating to the existence of strain due to growth conditions. Moreover, these systems exhibit a dramatic slowing down of exciton dynamics (100s of ps to few ns) with increase in carrier densities, which strongly contrasts with the monolayers in their freestanding form as well as in comparison with more traditionally grown TMDs. We relate our observations to the modifications of the electronic bands as expected from the strain and associated population of the intervalley dark excitons that can now interplay with intravalley excitations. These findings are consistent across both the Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based TMD families, providing key information about the influence of the growth conditions on the nature of optical excitations and fostering emerging optoelectronic applications of monolayer TMDs.

         <title>Ultrafast, Durable, and High&#8208;loading Polymer Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>

Abstract
Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid&#8208;level energy storage yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low coulombic efficiency. Herein, we developed an ultrafast, stable, and high&#8208;loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer was rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte was manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering resulted in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near&#8208;theoretical capacity, ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (&#8764;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), ultrafast rate (100 A g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co&#8208;storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode was coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrated ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Versatile Polymer&#8208;Initiating Biomineralization for Tumor Blockade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facilely synthesized versatile polymer, 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8211;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;alendronate, not only serves as an initiator to trigger the biomineralization in the peripheral region of tumors after anchoring on the surface of the tumor cell membrane, but also as an anti&#8208;osteoclast agent to alleviate bone destruction, both of which efficiently suppress the growth and lung metastasis of osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Tumor blockade therapy is a promising penetration&#8208;independent antitumor modality, which effectively inhibits the exchange of nutrients, oxygen, and information between the tumor and surrounding microenvironments. However, the current blockade therapy strategies have limited antitumor efficacy due to defects of inadequate tumor obstruction, possible side effects, and short duration. For these reasons, a facilely synthesized versatile polymer 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8211;N&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;alendronate (DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;ALN, DPA) is developed to initiate the formation of biomineral shell around osteosarcoma as a potent physical barrier. The DSPE moiety shares a similar chemical structure with the cytomembrane, allowing the membrane insertion of DPA. The bisphosphonic acid groups in ALN attract ions to realize biomineralization around cells. After injection in the invasive osteosarcoma tissue, DPA inserts into the cytomembrane, induces continuous mineral deposition, and ultimately builds a physical barrier around the tumor. Meanwhile, ALN in DPA alleviates bone destruction by suppressing the activity of osteoclasts. Through hindering the exchange of necessary substances, the biomineralization coating inhibits the growth of primary osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastasis simultaneously. Therefore, the multifunctional polymer&#8208;initiating blockade therapy provides a promising modality for tumor inhibition in clinics with high efficacy and negligible side effects.

         <dc:description>
The nightmare of each plumber is a large network of entangled and branched pipes. In this work, this assembly is realized for pipes with diameters of a few hundred nanometers. Water is pumped through the network and solute molecules are exchanged between adjacent pipes. This liquid&#8211;liquid extraction process demonstrates the potential for continuous&#8208;flow molecular separations, important for a sustainable chemical industry.








Abstract
Fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels are unique materials that allow two distinct fluids to interact through a percolating, rigid scaffold. Current restrictions for their use are the large fluid&#8208;channel sizes (&gt;5&#160;&#181;m), limiting the fluid&#8211;fluid interaction surface&#8208;area, and the inability to flow liquids through the channels. In this work a scalable synthesis route of nanoparticle stabilized fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels with channels sizes below 500&#160;nm and specific surface areas of 2 m2 cm&#8722;3 is introduced. Moreover, it is demonstrated that liquids can be pumped through the fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels via electroosmosis. The fast liquid flow in the fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gel facilitates their use for molecular separations in continuous&#8208;flow liquid&#8211;liquid extraction. Together with the high surface areas, liquid flow through fluid&#8208;bicontinuous gels enhances their potential as highly permeable porous materials with possible uses as microreaction media, fuel&#8208;cell components, and separation membranes.

         <title>Advances in High&#8208;Performance Autonomous Energy and Self&#8208;Powered Sensing Textiles with Novel 3D Fabric Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart textiles with autonomous energy supply and self&#8208;powered sensing abilities are extremely important for the future Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things and artificial intelligence. The high&#8208;performance textile triboelectric nanogenerators with novel 3D fabrics are comprehensively reviewed by focusing on representative structural classifications. The remarkable superiorities and potential challenges of 3D fabrics are also prospectively discussed in the end.








Abstract
The seamless integration of emerging triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) technology with traditional wearable textile materials has given birth to the next&#8208;generation smart textiles, i.e., textile TENGs, which will play a vital role in the era of Internet of Things and artificial intelligences. However, low output power and inferior sensing ability have largely limited the development of textile TENGs. Among various approaches to improve the output and sensing performance, such as material modification, structural design, and environmental management, a 3D fabric structural scheme is a facile, efficient, controllable, and scalable strategy to increase the effective contact area for contact electrification of textile TENGs without cumbersome material processing and service area restrictions. Herein, the recent advances of the current reported textile TENGs with 3D fabric structures are comprehensively summarized and systematically analyzed in order to clarify their superiorities over 1D fiber and 2D fabric structures in terms of power output and pressure sensing. The forward&#8208;looking integration abilities of the 3D fabrics are also discussed at the end. It is believed that the overview and analysis of textile TENGs with distinctive 3D fabric structures will contribute to the development and realization of high&#8208;power output micro/nanowearable power sources and high&#8208;quality self&#8208;powered wearable sensors.

         <title>Thin&#8208;film Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Over the last 30 years, the study of ferroelectric oxides has been revolutionized by the implementation of epitaxial thin&#8208;film&#8208;based studies which have driven many advances in the understanding of ferroelectric physics and the realization of novel polar structures and functionalities. New questions have motivated the development of advanced synthesis, characterization, and simulations of epitaxial thin films and, in turn, have provided new insights and applications across the micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macro&#8208;scopic length scales. This review traces the evolution of ferroelectric thin&#8208;film research through the early days developing understanding of the roles of size and strain on ferroelectrics to the present day, where such understanding is used to create complex hierarchical domain structures, novel&#8208;polar topologies, and controlled chemical and defect profiles. The extension of epitaxial techniques, coupled with advances in high&#8208;throughput simulations, now stands to accelerate the discovery and study of new ferroelectric materials. Coming hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with these new materials is new understanding and control of ferroelectric functionalities. Today, researchers are actively working to apply these lessons in a number of applications, including novel memory and logic architectures, as well as a host of energy conversion devices.

         <title>Hydrothermal Synthesis of High&#8208;yield Red Fluorescent Carbon Dots with Ultra&#8208;narrow Emission By Controlled O/N Elements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, carbon dots have developed rapidly, but the reports on red fluorescent carbon dots (r&#8208;CDs) with narrow emission and high yield prepared by hydrothermal method are very few. In this work, the r&#8208;CDs with narrow dual emission (600&#160;nm and 658&#8211;683&#160;nm, FWHMs of 20&#160;nm and 30&#160;nm), fluorescence quantum yield of 41.0% and yield of 83.3% are prepared by hydrothermal method using o&#8208;phenylenediamine as a precursor and inorganic oxidant as a yield enhancer, and they have graphite nitrate&#8208;like structures. The long&#8208;wavelength side emission is aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) and reaches the near infrared region (683&#160;nm). A logarithmic relationship between the wavelength of AIE (y) and concentration of r&#8208;CDs (x) (y = 8.853ln(x)+688.53, R = 0.998) is found firstly. This regularity and the high monochromaticity of AIE emission are related to the existence of highly ordered structures in r&#8208;CDs solution, which had been proved by XRD. Its intrinsic emission (FWHM: 20&#160;nm) is the narrowest in the reports on r&#8208;CDs prepared by hydrothermal method. The reason is that the decrease of oxygen content makes the FWHMs become narrow, and the decrease of the pyridine nitrogen content and the increase of pyrrole nitrogen content make them narrower further. The FT&#8208;IR spectra and control experiments prove that oxidative polymerization is a necessary step for the preparation of r&#8208;CDs. The linear relationship between the amount of the oxidant and the yield of CDs indicates that the yield can be increased only by increasing the conversion rate of the polymerization process in the formation of CDs.

         <title>Establishing Thermal Infusion Method for Stable Zinc Metal Anodes in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metallic zinc (Zn) having low cost, high capacity, environmentally friendly features is considered to be an attractive anode material for aqueous energy storage devices. However, dendritic growth and severe side reactions restrict the development of Zn&#8208;metal anodes. Numerous three&#8208;dimensional (3D) hosts are extensively explored to settle these issues, whereas the accessible pre&#8208;storing of Zn metal into structured electrodes is challenging. Here, a thermal infusion strategy is firstly reported to create a stable composite Zn&#8208;based anode. Upon this melting&#8208;wetting&#8208;cooling process, the metallic Zn is densely and firmly encapsulated in the 3D skeleton, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth. Meanwhile, through in/ex&#8208;situ tests, the formation of ZnO layer on the metallic Zn surface inhibits the hydrogen evolution reactions (1.8&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and passivation during cycling. Consequently, the electrode enables a long&#8208;cycling life of over 1000 cycles at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell. The pouch cells pairing this novel anode and LiMn2O4 cathode maintain over 94 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retention after 300 cycles. This research presents an innovative Zn anode structure and extendable pre&#8208;storing metallic Zn method for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Metallic zinc (Zn) having low cost, high capacity, environmentally friendly features is considered to be an attractive anode material for aqueous energy storage devices. However, dendritic growth and severe side reactions restrict the development of Zn-metal anodes. Numerous three-dimensional (3D) hosts are extensively explored to settle these issues, whereas the accessible pre-storing of Zn metal into structured electrodes is challenging. Here, a thermal infusion strategy is firstly reported to create a stable composite Zn-based anode. Upon this melting-wetting-cooling process, the metallic Zn is densely and firmly encapsulated in the 3D skeleton, efficiently inhibiting the dendritic growth.

         <title>On Demand Programming of Liquid Metal&#8208;Composite Microstructures Through Direct Ink Write 3D Printing</title>

Abstract
Soft, elastically deformable composites with liquid metal (LM) droplets can enable new generations of soft electronics, robotics, and reconfigurable structures. However, techniques to control local composite microstructure, which ultimately governs material properties and performance, is lacking. Here we&#160;develop a direct ink writing technique to program LM microstructure (i.e., shape, orientation, and connectivity) on demand throughout elastomer composites. In contrast to inks with rigid particles that have fixed shape and size, we&#160;show that emulsion inks with LM fillers enable in&#8208;situ control of microstructure. This enables filaments, films, and 3D structures with unique LM microstructures that are generated on demand and locked in during printing. This includes smooth and discrete transitions from spherical to needle&#8208;like droplets, curvilinear microstructures, geometrically complex embedded inclusion patterns, and connected LM pathways. The printed materials are soft (modulus &lt; 200 kPa), highly deformable (&gt; 600% strain), and can be made locally insulating or electrically conductive using a single ink by controlling process conditions. We&#160;demonstrate these capabilities by embedding elongated LM droplets in a soft heat sink, which rapidly dissipates heat from high power LEDs. These programmable microstructures can enable new composite paradigms for emerging technologies that demand mechanical compliance with multifunctional response.&#160;

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of Monolayer Hexagonal Boron Nitride on Graphene with Giant Bandgap Renormalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Monolayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been widely considered as a fundamental building block for two&#8211;dimensional (2D) heterostructures and devices. However, the controlled and scalable synthesis of hBN and its 2D heterostructures has remained a daunting challenge. Here, we propose and further demonstrate a hBN/graphene (hBN/G) interface&#8211;mediated growth process for the controlled synthesis of high&#8211;quality monolayer hBN. We discover that the in&#8211;plane hBN/G interface can be precisely controlled, enabling the scalable epitaxy of unidirectional monolayer hBN on graphene, which exhibits a uniform moir&#233; superlattice consistent with single&#8211;domain hBN, aligned to the underlying graphene lattice. Furthermore, we identify that the deep&#8211;ultraviolet emission at 6.12&#160;eV stems from the 1s&#8211;exciton state of monolayer hBN with a giant renormalized direct bandgap on graphene. This work provides a viable path for the controlled synthesis of ultraclean, wafer&#8211;scale, atomically ordered 2D quantum materials, as well as the fabrication of 2D quantum electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Recent advances in encapsulation of flexible bioelectronic implants: materials, technologies and characterization methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioelectronic implantable systems (BIS) targeting biomedical and clinical research should combine long&#8208;term performance and biointegration in vivo. This article reviews recent advances in novel encapsulations to protect flexible versions of such systems from the surrounding biological environment, focusing on material strategies and synthesis techniques. Considerable effort is put on thin&#8208;film encapsulation (TFE), and specifically organic&#8208;inorganic multilayer architectures as a flexible and conformal alternative to conventional rigid cans. TFE are in direct contact with the biological medium thus must exhibit biocompatibility, inertness, hermeticity but also mechanical robustness, conformability and compatibility with manufacturing of microfabricated devices. Quantitative characterization methods of the barrier and mechanical performance of the TFE are reviewed with a particular emphasis on water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) through electrical, optical, or electrochemical principles. The integrability and functionalization of TFE into functional bioelectronic interfaces is also discussed. TFE represents a must&#8208;have component for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronic implants with diagnostic or therapeutic functions in human healthcare and precision medicine.

         <title>Microfluidic Tissue Engineering and Bio&#8208;Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidics enables the engineering of biological tissues through micro&#8208;precision control over the cell microenvironment, fabrication of cell&#8208;laden matrices, and distribution of fluids to perfuse 3D tissue constructs. In particular, microfluidically&#8208;advanced functional muscle tissues can be used as performant actuators in the next generation of bio&#8208;hybrid robots.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;hybrid technologies aim to replicate the unique capabilities of biological systems that could surpass advanced artificial technologies. Soft bio&#8208;hybrid robots consist of synthetic and living materials and have the potential to self&#8208;assemble, regenerate, work autonomously, and interact safely with other species and the environment. Cells require a sufficient exchange of nutrients and gases, which is guaranteed by convection and diffusive transport through liquid media. The functional development and long&#8208;term survival of biological tissues in vitro can be improved by dynamic flow culture, but only microfluidic flow control can develop tissue with fine structuring and regulation at the microscale. Full control of tissue growth at the microscale will eventually lead to functional macroscale constructs, which are needed as the biological component of soft bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in microfluidic techniques to engineer biological tissues, focusing on the use of muscle cells for robotic bio&#8208;actuation. Moreover, the instances in which bio&#8208;actuation technologies greatly benefit from fusion with microfluidics are highlighted, which include: the microfabrication of matrices, biomimicry of cell microenvironments, tissue maturation, perfusion, and vascularization.

         <title>Autonomous Reconstitution of Fractured Hybrid Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) are a widely researched class of materials with prospects for a vast array of optoelectronic applications. In this work, it is demonstrated that broken centimeter&#8208;sized crystals of a typical HOIP, MAPbI3, can self&#8208;heal and are capable of mechanical and electrical recovery after mild compression of their fragments.








Abstract
The outstanding performance and facile processability turn hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites into one of the most sought&#8208;after classes of semiconducting materials for optoelectronics. Yet, their translation into real&#8208;world applications necessitates that challenges with their chemical stability and poor mechanical robustness are first addressed. Here, centimeter&#8208;size single crystals of methylammoniumlead(II) iodide (MAPbI3) are reported to be capable of autonomous self&#8208;healing under minimal compression at ambient temperature. When crystals are halved and the fragments are brought in contact, they can readily self&#8208;repair as a result of a liquid&#8208;like behavior of their lattice at the contact surface, which leads to a remarkable healing with an efficiency of up to 82%. The successful reconstitution of the broken single crystals is reflected in recuperation of their optoelectronic properties. Testing of the healed crystals as photodetectors shows an impressive 74% recovery of the generated photocurrent relative to pristine crystals. This self&#8208;healing capability of MAPbI3 single crystals is an efficient strategy to overcome the poor mechanical properties and low wear resistance of these materials, and paves the way for durable and stable optoelectronic devices based on single crystals of hybrid perovskites.

To achieve high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence satisfying Rec.2020 standard blue gamut, two thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitters are developed: 5&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;10,10&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;5,10&#8208;dihydrodibenzo[b,e][1,4]azasiline (TDBA&#8208;PAS) and 10&#8208;(2,12&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;5,9&#8208;dioxa&#8208;13b&#8208;boranaphtho[3,2,1&#8208;de]anthracen&#8208;7&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;9,10&#8208;dihydroacridine (TDBA&#8208;DPAC). Inheriting from their parented organoboron multi&#8208;resonance core, both emitters show very promising deep&#8208;blue emissions with relatively narrow full width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM, &#8776;50&#160;nm in solution), high photoluminescence quantum yield (up to 92.3%), and short emission lifetime (&#8804;2.49&#160;&#181;s) with fast reverse intersystem crossing (&gt;106 s&#8722;1) in doped films. More importantly, replacing the spiro&#8208;centered sp3 C atom (TDBA&#8208;DPAC) with the larger&#8208;radius sp3 Si atom (TDBA&#8208;PAS), enhanced conformational heterogeneities in bulky&#8208;group&#8208;shielded TADF molecules are observed in solution, doped film, and device. Consequently, OLEDs based on TDBA&#8208;PAS retain high maximum external quantum efficiencies &#8776;20% with suppressed efficiency roll&#8208;off and color index close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%. This study highlights a new strategy to restrain spectral broadening and redshifting and efficiency roll&#8208;off in the design of deep&#8208;blue TADF emitters.

&lt;p&gt;Conformational heterogeneity in bulky-group-shielded deep-blue thermally activated delayed fluorescent emitters enables suppression of spectral broadening, redshifting, and concentration quenching. Devices based on the emitter present high external quantum efficiency up to 22.35% with suppressed efficiency roll-off and color indices close to Rec.2020 blue gamut over a wide doping range of 10&#8211;50 wt%.

         <title>Ferroelastic&#8211;Ferroelectric Multiferroicity in van der Waals Rhenium Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroic materials can switch orientations of crystal structure and polarization with external strain. 2D ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline rhenium dichalcogenides is discovered. Reorientation of the physical properties based on reversible bond switching between the rhenium atoms provides insights for 2D multiferroic phase transitions and opens up new opportunities for applications such as multilevel memory.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with combined ferroic orders have gained attention owing to their novel functionality and underlying science. Intrinsic ferroelastic&#8211;ferroelectric multiferroicity in single&#8208;crystalline van der Waals rhenium dichalcogenides, whose symmetries are broken by the Peierls distortion and layer&#8208;stacking order, is demonstrated. Ferroelastic switching of the domain orientation and accompanying anisotropic properties is achieved with 1% uniaxial strain using the polymer encapsulation method. Based on the electron localization function and bond dissociation energy of the Re&#8211;Re bonds, the change in bond configuration during the evolution of the domain wall and the preferred switching between the two specific orientation states are explained. Furthermore, the ferroelastic switching of ferroelectric polarization is confirmed using the photovoltaic effect. The study provides insights into the reversible bond&#8208;switching process and potential applications based on 2D multiferroicity.

         <title>Self&#8208;Co&#8208;Electrolysis for Co&#8208;Production of Phosphate and Hydrogen in Neutral Phosphate Buffer Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
H2 gas, NaZnPO4, and electric energy can be generated concurrently by a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES), which is driven by the spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O in a neutral PBS solution. The SCES uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In the SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. A high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential.








Abstract
The spontaneous reaction between Zn and H2O is of critical importance and could plausibly be used to produce H2 gas, especially under neutral conditions. However, this reaction has long been overlooked owing to its sluggish kinetics and Zn consumption. Herein, a unique self&#8208;co&#8208;electrolysis system (SCES) is reported, which uses a Zn anode, a CoP&#8208;based catalytic cathode, and a neutral phosphate buffer solution (PBS) as the electrolyte. In this SCES, Zn is not only a sacrificial anode but also an important precursor of high&#8208;value&#8208;added NaZnPO4. Additionally, the composition and phase structure of NaZnPO4 can be well regulated. In this study, a high&#8208;performance N,Cu&#8208;CoP/carbon cloth (CC) catalyst is synthesized to catalyze the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at an especially low overpotential of 64.7 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. H2 gas (13.7 mL cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and NaZnPO4 (3.73 mg cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) are obtained at the cathode and anode, respectively, in the N,Cu&#8208;CoP/CC||Zn SCES spontaneously. Moreover, the SCES has a favorable open&#8208;circuit voltage (OCV) of 0.79 V and a maximum power density of 1.83 mW cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to elucidate the electronic structure and HER catalytic mechanism of the N and Cu co&#8208;doped CoP catalysts.

         <title>Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Fibers Embedded with Zincophilic Cu Nanoboxes for Stable Zn&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D framework consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (Cu NBs@NCFs) is constructed as a multifunctional host for dendrite&#8208;free and stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the macroporous network, hollow structures, and rich zincophilic sites, the Cu NBs@NCFs host shows low voltage hysteresis, high Coulombic efficiency, and impressive cycling stability in both symmetric and full cells.








Abstract
The practical application of Zn&#8208;metal anodes (ZMAs) is mainly impeded by the limited lifespan and low Coulombic efficiency (CE) resulting from the Zn dendrite growth and side reactions. Herein, a 3D multifunctional host consisting of N&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with Cu nanoboxes (denoted as Cu NBs@NCFs) is rationally designed and developed for stable ZMAs. The 3D macroporous configuration and hollow structure can lower the local current density and alleviate the large volume change during the repeated cycling processes. Furthermore, zincophilic Cu and in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Cu&#8211;Zn alloy can act as homogeneous nucleation sites to minimize the Zn nucleation overpotential, further guiding uniform and dense Zn deposition. As a result, this Cu NBs@NCFs host exhibits high CE of Zn plating/stripping for 1000 cycles. The Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn electrode shows low voltage hysteresis and prolonged cycling life (450 h) with dendrite&#8208;free behaviors. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a Zn&#8208;ion full cell is fabricated based on this Cu NBs@NCFs&#8211;Zn anode, which demonstrates decent rate capability and improved cycling performance.

LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 nanoparticles (NPs) loaded on a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold address the challenges associated with implant&#8208;related infections. The LL37 peptides grafted on NP surfaces effectively kill recalcitrant pathogens. Intracellular LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37 NPs then release loaded LL37 plasmids, providing a constant supply of LL37. The NPs also alleviate immunosuppression at sites of infection, thus restoring the normal anti&#8208;infection function of the immune system.








Abstract
As research on refractory Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;related implant infection intensifies, certain challenges remain, including low antibiotic concentrations within infected areas, immune escape achieved by intracellular bacteria, myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) inducing regional immunosuppression, and recurrence of residual pathogenic bacteria after drug suspension. Herein, a novel antimicrobial system to simultaneously address these issues is proposed. Specifically, an oxygen&#8208;species&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;printed scaffold with shell&#8211;core nanoparticles is designed, which are loaded with an antimicrobial peptide plasmid (LL37 plasmid) and have LL37 grafted on their surface (LL37@ZIF8&#8208;LL37). The surface&#8208;grafted LL37 directly kills S. aureus and, following entry into cells, the nanoparticles kill intracellular bacteria. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo, following translation of the LL37 plasmid, cells function as factories of the antimicrobial peptide, thereby generating a continuous, prolonged antibacterial effect at the site of infection. This system significantly reduces the abnormal increase in MDSCs within the infected microenvironment, thus relieving the immunosuppressive state and restoring a protective antimicrobial immune response. Hence, this proposed antimicrobial system provides an antimicrobial immune response and a novel strategy for S. aureus&#8208;related infections by offering a combined active antimicrobial and immunotherapeutic strategy, thereby significantly reducing the recurrence rate following recovery from implant&#8208;associated infections.

         <title>Magnetoelectric Effect in Hydrogen Harvesting: Magnetic Field as a Trigger of Catalytic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is initiated by exploiting the magnetoelectric nature of CoFe2O4&#8211;BiFeO3 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles purely with alternating magnetic fields. As a direct trigger for the HER, magnetic fields can open cooperative pathways for maximizing hydrogen production by synergetic combinations with other energy sources such as electric fields and light.








Abstract
Magnetic fields have been regarded as an additional stimulus for electro&#8208; and photocatalytic reactions, but not as a direct trigger for catalytic processes. Multiferroic/magnetoelectric materials, whose electrical polarization and surface charges can be magnetically altered, are especially suitable for triggering and control of catalytic reactions solely with magnetic fields. Here, it is demonstrated that magnetic fields can be employed as an independent input energy source for hydrogen harvesting by means of the magnetoelectric effect. Composite multiferroic CoFe2O4&#8211;BiFeO3 core&#8211;shell nanoparticles act as catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is triggered when an alternating magnetic field is applied to an aqueous dispersion of the magnetoelectric nanocatalysts. Based on density functional calculations, it is proposed that the hydrogen evolution is driven by changes in the ferroelectric polarization direction of BiFeO3 caused by the magnetoelectric coupling. It is believed that the findings will open new avenues toward magnetically induced renewable energy harvesting.

         <title>Upcycling Silicon Photovoltaic Waste into Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon from waste photovoltaics is recycled into thermoelectrics in this work. The majority&#8208;carrier nature of thermoelectrics (defect and impurity insensitive) is highlighted as the perfect destination for recycling minority&#8208;carrier devices (such as photovoltaics). This work closes the loop for sustainability in green energy production.








Abstract
Two decades after the rapid expansion of photovoltaics, the number of solar panels reaching end&#8208;of&#8208;life is increasing. While precious metals such as silver and copper are usually recycled, silicon, which makes up the bulk of a solar cells, goes to landfills. This is due to the defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;sensitive nature in most silicon&#8208;based technologies, rendering it uneconomical to purify waste silicon. Thermoelectrics represents a rare class of material in which defects and impurities can be engineered to enhance the performance. This is because of the majority&#8208;carrier nature, making it defect&#8208; and impurity&#8208;tolerant. Here, the upcycling of silicon from photovoltaic (PV) waste into thermoelectrics is enabled. This is done by doping 1% Ge and 4% P, which results in a figure of merit (zT) of 0.45 at 873&#160;K, the highest among silicon&#8208;based thermoelectrics. The work represents an important piece of the puzzle in realizing a circular economy for photovoltaics and electronic waste.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Ended Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 Heterostructures Nanocage Anode with Enhanced Reaction Kinetics for Superior Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are accurately designed and synthesized by a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration method, which displays excellent electrochemical performance as the anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sulfides are perceived as promising anode materials for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and structural diversity. Nonetheless, the poor structural stability and sluggish kinetics of sulfides lead to unsatisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, Ni3S2&#8211;Co9S8 heterostructures with an open&#8208;ended nanocage structure wrapped by reduced graphene oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO cages) are well designed as the anode for PIBs via a selective etching and one&#8208;step sulfuration approach. The hollow Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO nanocages, with large surface area, abundant heterointerfaces, and unique open&#8208;ended nanocage structure, can reduce the K+ diffusion length and promote reaction kinetics. When used as the anode for PIBs, the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO exhibits high reversible capacity and low capacity degradation (0.0089% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1). A potassium&#8208;ion full battery with a Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO anode and Prussian blue cathode can display a superior reversible capacity of 400&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 after 300 cycles at 2&#160;A&#160;g&#8211;1. The unique structural advantages and electrochemical reaction mechanisms of the Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;S@rGO are revealed by finite&#8208;element&#8208;simulation in situ characterizations. The universal synthesis technology of bimetallic sulfide anodes for advanced PIBs may provide vital guidance to design high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

         <title>Creating Composite Vortex Beams with a Single Geometric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact metasurface approach is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to create composite vortex beams. A single geometric metasurface is used to realize the superposition of multiple vortex beams with different circular polarization states. This method provides a compact platform to generate composite vortex beams with engineered singularity distributions, which are fundamentally important for singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Composite vortex beams (CVBs) have attracted considerable interest recently due to the unique optical properties and potential applications. However, these beams are mainly generated using spatial light modulators, which suffer from large volume, high cost, and limited resolution. Benefiting from the ultrathin nature and unprecedented capability in light manipulation, optical metasurfaces provide a compact platform to perform this task. A metasurface approach to creating these CVBs is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The design is based on the superposition of multiple circularly polarized vortex beams with different topological charges, which is realized based on a geometric metasurface consisting of metallic nanorods with spatially variant orientations. The effects of the initial phases, amplitude coefficients, incident polarization state, and propagation distance on the generated CVBs, which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, are experimentally analyzed. This work has opened a new avenue for engineering CVBs with a minimal footprint, which has promising applications ranging from multiple optical traps to quantum science.

However, these beams are mainly generated using spatial light modulators, which suffer from large volume, high cost, and limited resolution. Benefiting from the ultrathin nature and unprecedented capability in light manipulation, optical metasurfaces provide a compact platform to perform this task. A metasurface approach to creating these CVBs is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The design is based on the superposition of multiple circularly polarized vortex beams with different topological charges, which is realized based on a geometric metasurface consisting of metallic nanorods with spatially variant orientations. The effects of the initial phases, amplitude coefficients, incident polarization state, and propagation distance on the generated CVBs, which are in good agreement with the theoretical prediction, are experimentally analyzed. This work has opened a new avenue for engineering CVBs with a minimal footprint, which has promising applications ranging from multiple optical traps to quantum science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging 4D Printing Strategies for Next&#8208;Generation Tissue Regeneration and Medical Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
4D printing is becoming a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research field that holds considerable promise for diverse applications. This article introduces fabrication technologies and transforming strategies in terms of structural design and material composition design. The various 4D inks, actuation mechanisms, and recent advances in tissue regeneration and medical devices are summarized. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives are presented.








Abstract
The rapid development of 3D printing has led to considerable progress in the field of biomedical engineering. Notably, 4D printing provides a potential strategy to achieve a time&#8208;dependent physical change within tissue scaffolds or replicate the dynamic biological behaviors of native tissues for smart tissue regeneration and the fabrication of medical devices. The fabricated stimulus&#8208;responsive structures can offer dynamic, reprogrammable deformation or actuation to mimic complex physical, biochemical, and mechanical processes of native tissues. Although there is notable progress made in the development of the 4D printing approach for various biomedical applications, its more broad&#8208;scale adoption for clinical use and tissue engineering purposes is complicated by a notable limitation of printable smart materials and the simplistic nature of achievable responses possible with current sources of stimulation. In this review, the recent progress made in the field of 4D printing by discussing the various printing mechanisms that are achieved with great emphasis on smart ink mechanisms of 4D actuation, construct structural design, and printing technologies, is highlighted. Recent 4D&#160;printing studies which focus on the applications of tissue/organ regeneration and medical devices are then summarized. Finally, the current challenges and future perspectives of 4D printing are also discussed.

         <title>MXenes for Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress in employing MXenes in energy harvesting applications is summarized. Different energy sources, including solar, ultrasound, electrokinetic, salinity&#8208;gradient, piezoelectric, triboelectric, thermoelectric, and humidity energy, are discussed separately. The future challenges and promising directions of MXene research for energy harvesting are presented.








Abstract
Energy harvesting modules play an increasingly important role in the development of autonomous self&#8208;powered microelectronic devices. MXenes (i.e., 2D transition metal carbide/nitride) have recently emerged as promising candidates for energy applications due to their excellent electronic conductivity, large specific surface area, and tunable properties. Herein, a perspective on using MXenes to harvest energy from various sources in the environment is presented. First, the characteristics of MXenes that facilitate energy capturing are systematically introduced and the preparation strategies of MXenes and their derived nanostructures tailored toward such applications are summarized. Subsequently, the harvesting mechanism of different energy sources (e.g., solar energy, thermoelectric energy, triboelectric energy, piezoelectric energy, salinity&#8208;gradient energy, electrokinetic energy, ultrasound energy, and humidity energy) are discussed. Then, the recent progress of MXene&#8208;based nanostructures in energy harvesting, as well as their applications, is introduced. Finally, opinions on the existing challenges and future directions of MXene&#8208;based nanostructure for energy harvesting are presented.

Virtual reality is a brand new technology that can be applied extensively. To realize virtual reality, certain types of human&#226;&#8364;computer interaction equipment are necessary. Existing virtual reality technologies often rely on cameras, data gloves, game pads, and other equipment. These equipment are either bulky, inconvenient to carry and use, or expensive to popularize. Therefore, the development of a convenient and low&#8208;cost high&#8208;precision human&#226;&#8364;computer interaction device will contribute positively to the development of virtual reality technology. In this study, we developed a gesture recognition wristband that can realize a full keyboard and multi&#8208;command input. The wristband is convenient to wear, low in cost, and does not affect other daily operations of the hand. This wristband is based on physiological anatomy as well as aided by active sensor and machine learning technology; it can achieve a maximum accuracy of 92.6% in recognizing 26 letters. This wristband offers broad application prospects in the fields of gesture command recognition, assistive devices for the disabled, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrZr4Te14 with Large In&#8208;plane Anisotropic Negative Magnetoresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The discovery of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials is of great significance to explore intriguing 2D magnetic physics and develop innovative spintronic devices. Herein, a new quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (1D) vdW layered compound CrZr4Te14 is successfully synthesized. Owing to the existence of 1D [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis, CrZr4Te14 crystals show strong anisotropy of phonon vibrations, electrical transport, and magnetism. Density functional theory calculations reveal the ferromagnetic (FM) coupling within the [CrTe2] chain, while the interchain and interlayer couplings are both weakly antiferromagnetic (AF). Notably, a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance (nMR) of &#8208;56% is achieved at 2 K under 9 T, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor of nMR can reach up to 8.2 in CrZr4Te14 device. The 1D FM chains and anisotropic nMR effect make CrZr4Te14 an interesting platform for exploring novel polarization&#8208;sensitive spintronics.

         <title>Gires&#8208;Tournois immunoassay platform for label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bright&#8208;field imaging of nanoscale bioparticles is a challenging task for optical microscopy because the light&#8208;matter interactions of bioparticles are weak on conventional surfaces due to their low refractive index and small size. Alternatively, advanced imaging techniques, including near&#8208;field microscopy and phase microscopy, have enabled visualization and quantification of the bioparticles, but they require assistance of sophisticated/customized systems and post&#8208;processing with complex established algorithms. Here, we present a simple and fast immunoassay device, Gires&#8208;Tournois immunoassay platform (GTIP), which provides unique color dynamics in response to optical environment changes and thus enables the label&#8208;free bright&#8208;field imaging and facile quantification of bioparticles using conventional optical microscopy. Bioparticles on GTIP slow down the velocity of reflected light, leading to vivid color change according to the local particle density and maximizing chromatic contrast for high spatial distinguishability. The particle distribution and density on the surface of the resonator are readily analyzed through 2D raster&#8208;scanning&#8211;based chromaticity analysis. GTIP offers multiscale sensing capability for target analytes that possess different refractive indices and sizes.

Abstract
Aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have been rapidly developed recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their fast charging capability and high power densities. In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion&#8208;type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Effective Approaches for Designing Stable M&#8208;Nx/C Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Catalysts for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The large&#8208;scale commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is extremely limited by their costly platinum&#8208;group metals (PGMs) catalysts, which are used for catalyzing the sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics at the cathode. Among the reported PGM&#8208;free catalysts so far, metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;Nx/C) catalysts hold a great potential to replace PGMs catalysts for ORR due to their excellent initial activity and low cost. However, despite tremendous progress in this field in the past decade, their further applications are restricted by fast degradation under practical conditions. In this review, the theoretical fundamentals of the stability of the M&#8208;Nx/C catalysts are firstly introduced in terms of thermodynamics and kinetics. The primary degradation mechanisms of M&#8208;Nx/C catalysts and the corresponding mitigating strategies are discussed in detail. Finally, this review outlines the current challenges and the prospects for designing highly stable M&#8208;Nx/C catalysts.

         <title>An asymmetric hygroscopic structure for moisture&#8208;driven hygro&#8208;ionic electricity generation and storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interactions between moisture and materials give rise to the possibility of moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG). Current MEG materials and devices only establish this interaction during water sorption in specific configurations, and conversion is eventually ceased by saturated water uptake. This paper reports an asymmetric hygroscopic structure (AHS) that simultaneously achieves energy harvesting and storage from moisture absorption. The AHS is constructed by the asymmetric deposition of a hygroscopic ionic hydrogel over a layer of functionalized carbon. Water absorbed from the air creates wet&#8208;dry asymmetry across the AHS and hence an in&#8208;plane electric field. The asymmetry can be perpetually maintained even after saturated water absorption. The absorbed water triggers the spontaneous development of an electrical double layer (EDL) over the carbon surface, which is termed a hygro&#8208;ionic process, accounting for the capacitive properties of the AHS. A peak power density of 70 &#956;W cm&#8211;3 was realised after geometry optimisation. The AHS showed the ability to be recharged either by itself owing to a self&#8208;regeneration effect or via external electrical means, which allows it to serve as an energy storage device. In addition to insights into moisture&#8208;material interaction, AHSs further shows potential for electronics powering in assembled devices.

         <title>High Energy and Stable Subfreezing Aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with Selective and Pseudocapacitive Zn&#8208;ion insertion in MnO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
One major challenge of aqueous Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries for practical applications is their unacceptable performance below freezing temperatures. Here we describe the use of simple Zn(ClO4)2 aqueous electrolytes for all&#8208;weather Zn&#8208;MnO2 batteries even down to &#8208;60&#176;C. The symmetric, bulky ClO4&#8211; anion effectively disrupt hydrogen bonds between water molecules and provides intrinsic ion diffusion even while frozen, and this enabled &#8764; 260 mAh/g on MnO2 cathodes at &#8208;30&#176;C in 3.0M Zn(ClO4)2. We identified that sub&#8208;freezing cycling shifted the reaction mechanism on the MnO2 cathode from unstable H+ insertion to predominately pseudocapacitive Zn2+ insertion, which converted MnO2 nanofibers into complicated zincated MnOx that were largely disordered and appeared as crumpled paper sheets. The Zn2+ insertion at &#8208;30&#176;C is faster and much more stable than at 20&#176;C, and delivered &#8764;80% capacity retention for 1000 cycles without any Mn2+ additives. In addition, simple Zn(ClO4)2 electrolyte also enabled a nearly fully reversible and dendrite free Zn anode at &#8208;30&#176;C with &#8764;98% columbic efficiency. We further demonstrate Zn&#8208;MnO2 prototypes with an experimentally verified unit energy density of 148 Wh/kg with a N/P ratio of 1.5 and a E/C ratio of 2.0, which provide feasible approaches to advance all&#8208;weather aqueous batteries.

         <title>Exchange bias in molecule/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures via spinterface effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The exfoliation of layered magnetic materials generates atomically thin flakes characterized by an ultrahigh surface sensitivity, which makes their magnetic properties tunable via external stimuli, such as electrostatic gating and proximity effects. Another powerful approach to engineer magnetic materials is molecular functionalization, generating hybrid interfaces with tailored magnetic interactions, called spinterfaces. However, spinterface effects have not yet been explored on layered magnetic materials.
Here, we demonstrate the emergence of spinterface effects at the interface between flakes of the prototypical layered magnetic metal Fe3GeTe2 and thin films of Co&#8208;phthalocyanine. Magnetotransport measurements show that the molecular layer induces a magnetic exchange bias in Fe3GeTe2, indicating that the unpaired spins in Co&#8208;phthalocyanine develop antiferromagnetic ordering and pin the magnetization reversal of Fe3GeTe2 via magnetic proximity. The effect is strongest for a Fe3GeTe2 thickness of 20 nm, for which the exchange bias field reaches &#8211;840 Oe at 10 K and is measurable up to approximately 110 K. This value compares very favorably with previous exchange bias fields reported for Fe3GeTe2 in all&#8208;inorganic van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating the potential of molecular functionalization to tailor the magnetism of van der Waals layered materials.

         <title>Corrosion Chemistry of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalysts are the core components of many sustainable energy conversion technologies that are considered the most potential solution to the worldwide energy and environmental crises. The reliability of structure and composition pledges that electrocatalysts can achieve predictable and stable performance. However, during the electrochemical reaction, electrocatalysts are influenced directly by applied potential, electrolyte and the adsorption/desorption of reactive species, triggering structural and compositional corrosions, which directly affect the catalytic behavior of electrocatalysts (performance degradation or enhancement) and invalidate the established structure&#8208;activity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the corrosion behavior and mechanism of electrocatalysts in order to formulate targeted corrosion&#8208;resistant strategies or utilize corrosion reconstruction synthesis techniques to guide the preparation of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. This study outlines the most recent developments in electrocatalyst corrosion chemistry, including corrosion mechanisms, mitigation strategies and corrosion syntheses/reconstructions based on typical materials and important electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, potential opportunities and challenges are also proposed to foresee the possible development in this field. We believe that this contribution will raise more awareness regarding nanomaterial corrosion chemistry in energy technologies and beyondim.

         <title>Modularizable liquid crystal&#8208;based open surfaces enable programmable chemical transport and feeding using liquid droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Droplet&#8208;based miniature reactors have attracted interest in both fundamental studies, for the unique reaction kinetics they enable, and applications in bio&#8208;diagnosis and material synthesis. However, the precise and automatic feeding of chemicals, important for the delicate reactions in these miniaturized chemical reactors, either requires complex, high&#8208;cost microfluidic devices or lacks the capability to maintain a pinning&#8208;free droplet movement. Here, we report the design and synthesis of a new class of liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;based open surfaces which enable a controlled chemical release via a programmable LC phase transition without sacrificing the free transport of the droplets. We demonstrate that their intrinsic slipperiness and self&#8208;healing properties enable a modularizable assembly of LC surfaces which can be loaded with different chemicals to achieve a wide range of chemical reactions carried out within droplets, including sequential and parallel chemical reactions, crystal growth and polymer synthesis. Finally, we develop an LC&#8208;based chemical feeding device that can automatically control the release of chemicals to direct the simultaneous differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into endothelial progenitor cells and cardiomyocytes. Overall, our LC surfaces exhibit desirable levels of automation, responsiveness, and controllability for use in miniature droplet carriers and reactors.

         <title>Crosstalk&#8208;free, high&#8208;resolution pressure sensor arrays enabled by high&#8208;throughput laser manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Simultaneously achieving high spatial resolution and low crosstalk interference has been a fundamental challenge for flexible pressure sensor arrays. Here we present a high&#8208;resolution flexible pressure sensor array fabricated through a two&#8208;step laser manufacturing process, where individual sensing pixels and their interconnects are sequentially defined by laser&#8208;induced graphenization and ablation to minimize crosstalk interferences. The geometry of the interconnects is optimized through theoretical modeling and experimental validation. Characterization results show that the new device design induces a remarkable reduction of the crosstalk coefficient, from &#8208;8.21 dB to &#8208;43.63 dB, of the 0.7 mm&#8208;resolution sensor arrays, and the crosstalk suppression is particularly beneficial for application scenarios involving pressure sensing on soft surfaces (e.g. human skin and organs). Applications of the sensor array in tactile pattern recognition and minimally&#8208;invasive cancer surgery are demonstrated.
