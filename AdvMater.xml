         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reliable spintronic physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are demonstrated by exploiting field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. The stochastic switching polarity of the top CoFeB is achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. The spintronic PUF is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, digital output, a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations, and robustness against magnetic tempering.








Abstract
Physical unclonable function&#160;(PUFs) utilize inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and are a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUFs promise more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures are demonstrated. It is shown that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, and digital output. Furthermore, the device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

         <title>Etching Bulk Covalent Organic Frameworks into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new preparation strategy for nanoscale covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is reported, and this strategy only needs to slightly extend the commonly used COF preparation process to prepare COF nanoparticles, which is suitable for different types of imine COFs. The nanoscale COF sonosensitizer is applied for enhanced sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy.








Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. A covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer is developed by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy uses molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch the bulk COF into nanoparticles and has universal applicability to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure can prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endows the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy performance and glutathione consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieves a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Understanding H2 Evolution Electrochemistry to Minimize Solvated Water Impact on Zinc&#8208;Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, and it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode.








Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn&#8208;metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and, using a glycine additive to reduce solvated water, it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. This electrolyte additive is evidenced to suppress H2 evolution, reduce corrosion, and give a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells. It is demonstrated that Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8211;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte. It is concluded that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIBs for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Migration Mechanism: An Overall Understanding of Anionic Redox Activity in Metal Oxide Cathodes of Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;migration mechanism is proposed to explain the different anionic redox reaction (ARR) behaviors between Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that ARR activation is closely related to the migration of substitution metal from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal layer in a kinetic aspect, and vacancies in the TM layers play a vital role to activate the ARR activities.








Abstract
The anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted extensive attention due to its potential to enhance the reversible capacity of cathode materials in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, the understanding of its activation mechanism is still limited by the insufficient mastering of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. Herein, a series of Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2 cathode materials are designed to investigate their ARR behaviors. It is found that the ARR can be activated in only Li&#8208;substituted LixMnO2 and not for Mg&#8208; and Zn&#8208;substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental results, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes is closely related to the migration of substitution ions from the transition metal layer to the alkali metal layer in a kinetic aspect, which generates unique Li(Na)&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;TM and/or &#9633;Li/Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;TM configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion&#8208;migration mechanism is proposed to explain the different ARR behaviors between the NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high&#8208;capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.

         <title>Interspace and Vacancy Modulation: Promoting the Zinc Storage of an Alcohol&#8208;Based Organic&#8211;Inorganic Cathode in a Water&#8211;Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8722;xPO4&#183;0.56C6H14O4, with enriched oxygen defects and tunable d&#8208;interspace, is designed and used as a model platform to systematically elucidate the correlation of some physicochemical properties. Coordination between the water&#8211;organic electrolyte and molecular engineering, an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile, high capacity, and long&#8208;life are achieved for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Expanding interspace and introducing vacancies are desired to promote the mobility of Zn ions and unlock the inactive sites of layered cathodes. However, this two&#8208;point modulation has not yet been achieved simultaneously in vanadium phosphate. Here, a strategy is proposed for fabricating an alcohol&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8722;xPO4&#183;0.56C6H14O4, to realize the conjoint modulation of the d&#8208;interspace and oxygen vacancies. Peculiar triglycol molecules with an inclined orientation in the interlayer also boost the improvement in the conversion rate of V5+ to V4+ and the intensity of the P&#63743;O bond. Their synergism can ensure steerable adjustment for intercalation kinetics and electron transport, as well as realize high chemical reactivity and redox&#8208;center optimization, leading to at least 200% increase in capacity. Using a water&#8211;organic electrolyte, the designed Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile deliver a long&#8208;term durability (fivefold greater than pristine material) and an excellent energy density of &#8776;142&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (including masses of cathode and anode), thereby substantially outstripping most of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proves the feasibility to realize the two&#8208;point modulation by using organic intercalants for exploiting high&#8208;performance new 2D materials.

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;Like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioactive HCIr nanocluster is reported for triggering effective ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death via triggering GPX4 inhibition and concurrent dual sonodynamic effect by iridium oxide nanoclusters and chlorin e6 (Ce6). These HCIr nanoclusters hold a great promise as a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent for treating intrinsic apoptotic resistance of tumors, and the findings provide a promising strategy for future studies exploring nanoclusters as anticancer agents.








Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations have reported&#160;that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy can overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8211;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters, is developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibits highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound&#160;stimulation, which promotes the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induces ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr can deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8211;Ir (III) transition, which further suppresses the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that HCIr possesses tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhances SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. Thus, an iridium&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent is developed, providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

         <title>A Time&#8208;Division Position&#8208;Sensitive Detector Image System for High&#8208;Speed Multitarget Trajectory Tracking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitarget real&#8208;time trajectory tracking system is designed by using a time&#8208;division position&#8208;sensitive detector system based on the lateral photovoltaic effect. There is no trade&#8208;off between framerate and resolution and the output framerate up to 62&#160;000 fps at a 0.84&#160;&#181;m spatial resolution. Moreover, frequency&#8208;related image preprocessing is demonstrated. Multichannel tracking enables object category identification, and image&#8208;distortion correction enhances the versatility in complicated environments.








Abstract
High&#8208;speed trajectory tracking with real&#8208;time processing capability is particularly important in the fields of pilotless automobiles, guidance systems, robotics, and filmmaking. The conventional optical approach to high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking involves charge coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#160;(CMOS) image sensors, which suffer from trade&#8208;offs between resolution and framerates, complexity of the system, and enormous data&#8208;analysis processes. Here, a high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking system is designed by using a time&#8208;division position&#8208;sensitive detector (TD&#8208;PSD) based on a graphene&#8211;silicon Schottky heterojunction. Benefiting from the high&#8208;speed optoelectronic response and sub&#8208;micrometer positional accuracy of the TD&#8208;PSD, multitarget real&#8208;time trajectory tracking is realized, with a maximum image output framerate of up to 62&#160;000 frames&#160;per second. Moreover, multichannel trajectory tracking and image&#8208;distortion correction functionalities are realized by TD&#8208;PSD systems through frequency&#8208;related image preprocessing, which significantly improves the capacity of real&#8208;time information processing and image quality in complicated light environments.

         <title>A Universal Chemotactic Targeted Delivery Strategy for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial chemotaxis system that shows positive chemotaxis to high concentration of inducible nitric oxide synthase and reactive oxygen species is proposed, which can precisely target inflammatory sites in vivo. Such a universal chemotactic delivery strategy aimed at the inflammatory microenvironment, can possibly avoid the problem of individual differences in the targeting strategies based on ligand&#8208;receptor specific binding.








Abstract
Above 50% of deaths can be attributed to chronic inflammatory diseases; thus, the construction of drug delivery systems based on effective interaction of inflammatory factors with chemotactic nanoparticles is meaningful. Herein, a zwitterion&#8208;based artificial chemotactic nanomotor is proposed for universal precise targeting strategy in vivo, where the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in inflammatory sites are used as a chemoattractant. Multidimensional static models, dynamic models, and in vivo models are established to evaluate chemotactic performance. The results show that the upregulated ROS and iNOS can induce the chemotaxis of nanomotors to diseased tissues in inflammation&#8208;related disease models. Further, mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations are performed to explain the chemotactic behavior of the nanomotors. Such a chemotactic delivery strategy is expected to improve delivery efficiency and may be applicable to a variety of inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Why it is Unfortunate that Linear Machine Learning &#8220;Works&#8221; so well in Electromechanical Switching of Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning has been lauded for its applications in materials science. The democratization has created concern about their misappropriation. In this work, it is shown how linear, nonordinal models can provide an illusion of learning details of electromechanical switching in ferroelectrics. A non&#8208;linear, ordinal deep&#8208;learning method is developed, overcoming some of the shortcomings of more simplistic models.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML)&#160;is relied on for materials spectroscopy. It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here, using a benchmark band&#8208;excitation piezoresponse force microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the pitfalls of the so&#8208;called &#8220;better&#8221;, &#8220;faster&#8221;, and &#8220;less&#8208;biased&#8221; ML of electromechanical switching are demonstrated and overcome. Using a toy and real experimental dataset, it is demonstrated how linear nontemporal ML methods result in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while producing nonsensical eigenvectors and generated spectra, promoting misleading interpretations. A new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS is demonstrated using long&#8208;short&#8208;term memory (LSTM) &#946;&#8208;variational autoencoders (&#946;&#8208;VAEs) . By including LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent space, a variational Kullback&#8211;Leibler&#8208;divergency regularization is imposed .

     alt="Why it is Unfortunate that Linear Machine Learning &#8220;Works&#8221; so well in Electromechanical Switching of Ferroelectric Thin Films"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning has been lauded for its applications in materials science. The democratization has created concern about their misappropriation. In this work, it is shown how linear, nonordinal models can provide an illusion of learning details of electromechanical switching in ferroelectrics. A non-linear, ordinal deep-learning method is developed, overcoming some of the shortcomings of more simplistic models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML)&#160;is relied on for materials spectroscopy. It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here, using a benchmark band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the pitfalls of the so-called &#8220;better&#8221;, &#8220;faster&#8221;, and &#8220;less-biased&#8221; ML of electromechanical switching are demonstrated and overcome. Using a toy and real experimental dataset, it is demonstrated how linear nontemporal ML methods result in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while producing nonsensical eigenvectors and generated spectra, promoting misleading interpretations. A new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS is demonstrated using long-short-term memory (LSTM) &#946;-variational autoencoders (&#946;-VAEs) . By including LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent space, a variational Kullback&#8211;Leibler-divergency regularization is imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling of &#946; as a disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce user bias. Combining these experiment-inspired modifications enables the automated detection of ferroelectric switching mechanisms, including a complex two-step, three-state one. Ultimately, this work provides a robust ML method for the rapid discovery of electromechanical switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials spectroscopies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Dendrite&#8208;Free Multivalent Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency multivalent metal plating/stripping is realized by confining Zn/Al&#8208;metal into a biomimetic scaffold through the synergy of a fractal copper array and a CaTiO3&#8208;based coating layer. The as&#8208;developed composite anodes exhibit dendrite&#8208;free morphologies with high reversibility and long lifespan, and excellent performance in multivalent metal full cells.








Abstract
Rechargeable multivalent metal (e.g., zinc (Zn) and aluminum (Al)) batteries are ideal choices for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic low cost and safety. However, the poor compatibility between metallic anodes and electrolytes strongly hampers their practical applications. Herein, it is demonstrated that confining multivalent metals in a biomimetic scaffold (Bio&#8208;scaffold) can achieve highly efficient multivalent metal plating/stripping. This Bio&#8208;scaffold is well&#8208;tailored through the synergy of a parallel&#8208;aligned array of fractal copper branches and a CaTiO3 (CTO)&#8208;based coating layer. By virtue of this design strategy, the as&#8208;developed Bio&#8208;scaffold&#8208;based Zn&#8208; and Al&#8208;metal anodes exhibited dendrite&#8208;free morphologies with high reversibility and long lifespan, as well as excellent performance for Zn and Al full batteries. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that the fractal copper array not only facilitates multivalent ion diffusion and electrolyte wetting but also effectively reduces the local current densities during cycling; Meanwhile, the CTO&#8208;based coating layer effectively blocks interfacial side reactions and enables a homogeneous ionic flux. This work opens a new avenue for developing multivalent metal batteries.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Low&#8208;Fouling Zwitterionic Polymeric Colloids as Resuscitation Fluids for Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;fouling N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymer is developed as a colloid for fluid resuscitation, which simultaneously improves oncotic potency and biocompatibility to resist interference with coagulation or deposition in major organs. When used as fluid therapy in a severe hemorrhagic shock model, it significantly improves resuscitation outcomes when compared with existing colloids or plasma (the gold standard).








Abstract
Colloids, known as volume expanders, have been used as resuscitation fluids for hypovolemic shock for decades, as they increase plasma oncotic pressure and expand intravascular volume. However, recent studies show that commonly used synthetic colloids have adverse interactions with human biological systems. In this work, a low&#8208;fouling amine(N)&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymer as an alternative volume expander with improved biocompatibility and efficacy is designed. It is demonstrated that the polymer possesses antifouling ability, resisting cell interaction and deposition in major organs, and is rapidly cleared via renal filtration and hepatic circulation, reducing the risk of long&#8208;term side effects. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies show an absence of adverse effects on hemostasis or any acute safety risks. Finally, it is shown that, in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with existing colloids and plasma, the zwitterionic polymer serves as a more potent oncotic agent for restoring intravascular volume in a hemorrhagic shock model. The design of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymers may lead to the development of alternative fluid therapies to treat hypovolemic shock and to improve fluid management in general.

         <title>Approaching the Intrinsic Threshold Breakdown Voltage and Ultrahigh Gain in a Graphite/InSe Schottky&#160;Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic threshold breakdown voltage with an ultrahigh gain is observed in an avalanche photodetector (APD) based on a graphite/InSe Schottky junction, which is attributed to the high ionization rate due to the reduced dimensionality of electron&#8211;phonon scattering in layered InSe. This work opens up a new avenue for future APDs with both low energy consumption and high sensitivity.








Abstract
Realizing both ultralow breakdown voltage and ultrahigh gain is one of the major challenges in the development of high&#8208;performance avalanche photodetector. Here, it is reported that an ultrahigh avalanche gain of 3 &#215; 105 can be realized in the graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector at a breakdown voltage down to 5.5&#160;V. Remarkably, the threshold breakdown voltage can be further reduced down to 1.8&#160;V by raising the operating temperature, approaching the theoretical limit of 1.5 Eg\[{{\cal E}_{\bf g}}\]/e, with Eg${{\cal E}_{\bf g}}$ the bandgap of semiconductor. A 2D impact ionization model is developed and it is uncovered that observation of high gain at low breakdown voltage arises from reduced dimensionality of electron&#8211;phonon scattering in the layered InSe flake. These findings open up a promising avenue for developing novel weak&#8208;light detectors with low energy consumption and high sensitivity.

         <title>Nanomaterials&#8208;Mediated Co&#8208;Stimulation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptors and CD40 for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TLR7/8 agonist R848&#8208;derived amino lipid nanoparticle (RAL&#8208;LNP) is conceived to deliver CD40 mRNA to dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor microenvironment to increase CD40 expression on DCs. Further combination with agonistic CD40 antibodies enables the synergistic effects of TLR7/8 and CD40 signaling pathways for DC maturation and activation, thereby promoting antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) and CD40&#8208;related signaling pathways represent critical bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, an immunotherapy regimen that enables co&#8208;stimulation of TLR7/8&#8208;&#160;and CD40&#8208;mediated pathways is developed.

&lt;p&gt;TLR7/8 agonist R848-derived amino lipid nanoparticle (RAL-LNP) is conceived to deliver CD40 mRNA to dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor microenvironment to increase CD40 expression on DCs. Further combination with agonistic CD40 antibodies enables the synergistic effects of TLR7/8 and CD40 signaling pathways for DC maturation and activation, thereby promoting antitumor immunity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and CD40-related signaling pathways represent critical bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, an immunotherapy regimen that enables co-stimulation of TLR7/8-&#160;and CD40-mediated pathways is developed. TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) derived amino lipids, RAL1 and RAL2, are synthesized and formulated into RAL-derived lipid nanoparticles (RAL-LNPs). The RAL2-LNPs show efficient CD40 mRNA delivery to DCs both in vitro (90.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.7%) and in vivo (61.3&#160;&#177;&#160;16.4%). When combined with agonistic anti-CD40 antibody, this approach can produce effective antitumor activities in mouse melanoma tumor models, thereby suppressing tumor growth, prolonging mouse survival, and establishing antitumor memory immunity. Overall, RAL2-LNPs provide a novel platform toward cancer immunotherapy by integrating innate and adaptive immunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Electro&#8208;Optic BaTiO3 Nanocrystals via Efficient Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates whether doping can be used to maintain the true promise of BaTiO3 as electro&#8208;optic (EO) material in films. The role of the donor dopant in increasing EO and, critically, of the acceptor dopant in compensating for charge imbalance and thus preventing undesired ion migration, is elucidated, providing a new route to realizing on&#8208;chip high&#8208;speed optical modulators.








Abstract
Electro&#8208;optic (EO) modulators provide electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion relevant to optical communications. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a promising material system for EO modulation in light of its optical ultrafast nonlinearity, low optical loss, and high refractive index. To enhance further its spontaneous polarization, BaTiO3 can be doped at the Ba and Ti sites; however, doping is often accompanied by ion migration, which diminishes EO performance. Here, donor&#8211;acceptor doping and its effect on EO efficiency are investigated, finding that La&#8208;doped BaTiO3 achieves an EO coefficient of 42 pm V&#8722;1 at 1&#160;kHz, fully twice that of the pristine specimen; however, it is also observed that, with this single&#8208;element doping, the EO response falls off rapidly with frequency. From impedance spectroscopy, it is found that frequency&#8208;dependent EO is correlated with ion migration. Density functional theory calculations predict that the ion&#8208;migration barrier decreases with La3+ doping but can be recovered with further Mn2+ doping, a finding that prompts to prevent ion migration by incorporating Mn2+ into the Ti&#8208;site to compensate for the charge imbalance.

         <title>Rapid Regeneration of a Neoartery with Elastic Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neoartery regenerated from a non&#8208;porous graft fabricated from tropoelastin and polyglycerol sebacate displays cellular and extracellular matrix structures approximating the adventitia and intima&#8208;media in native mouse aorta. The adventitia contains mature collagen fibrils. Within the intima&#8208;media, an internal elastic lamina is surrounded by multiple elastic lamellae sandwiched between circumferentially aligned smooth muscle cell layers.








Abstract
Native arteries contain a distinctive intima&#8208;media composed of organized elastin and an adventitia containing mature collagen fibrils. In contrast, implanted biodegradable small&#8208;diameter vascular grafts do not present spatially regenerated, organized elastin. The elastin&#8208;containing structures within the intima&#8208;media region encompass the elastic lamellae (EL) and internal elastic lamina (IEL) and are crucial for normal arterial function. Here, the development of a novel electrospun small&#8208;diameter vascular graft that facilitates de novo formation of a structurally appropriate elastin&#8208;containing intima&#8208;media region following implantation is described. The graft comprises a non&#8208;porous microstructure characterized by tropoelastin fibers that are embedded in a PGS matrix. After implantation in mouse abdominal aorta, the graft develops distinct cell and extracellular matrix profiles that approximate the native adventitia and intima&#8208;media by 8 weeks. Within the newly formed intima&#8208;media region there are circumferentially aligned smooth muscle cell layers that alternate with multiple EL similar to that found in the arterial wall. By 8 months, the developed adventitia region contains mature collagen fibrils and the neoartery presents a distinct IEL with thickness comparable to that in mouse abdominal aorta. It is proposed that this new class of material can generate the critically required, organized elastin needed for arterial regeneration.

         <title>Interface Reconstruction from Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Structures Impacts Stability in Lead Halide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The impact of the bulky cation&#8208;modified interfaces on halide perovskite solar cell stability is underexplored. We demonstrate the thermal instability of the bulky cation interface layers used in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron&#8208;based grazing incidence X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal significant changes in the chemical composition and structure at the surface of these films that occur under thermal stress. The changes impact charge carrier dynamics and device operation, as shown in transient photoluminescence, excitation correlation spectroscopy, and solar cells. The type of cation used for surface treatment affects the extent of these changes, where long carbon chains provide more stable interfaces. These results highlight that prolonged annealing of the treated interfaces is critical to enable reliable reporting of performances and to drive the selection between different bulky cations.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional semiconductors represent one of the best candidates to extend Moore's law for their superiorities, such as keeping high carrier mobility and remarkable gate&#8208;control capability at atomic thickness. Complementary transistors and van der Waals junctions are critical in realizing 2D semiconductors&#8208;based integrated circuits suitable for future electronics. N&#8208;type 2D semiconductors have been reported predominantly for the strong electron doping caused by interfacial charge impurities and internal structural defects. By contrast, superior and reliable p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors with holes as majority carriers are still scarce. Not only that, but some critical issues have not been adequately addressed, including their controlled synthesis in wafer size and high quality, defect and carrier modulation, optimization of interface and contact, and application in high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power integrated devices. Here we review the material toolkit, synthesis strategies, device basics, and digital electronics closely related to p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors. We also discuss their opportunities, challenges, and prospects for future electronic applications, which would be promising or even shining in the post&#8208;Moore era.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, we report a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333 K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to in&#8208;plane configuration were achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions were successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295 K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8764;106 n&#937; cm was observed at 290 K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE was also found at low temperatures, which could be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride could be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

Therefore, chromium telluride could be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fabricating chiral inorganic materials and revealing their unique quantum confinement&#8208;determined optical chiral responses are crucial tasks in the multidisciplinary fields of chemistry, physics and biology. The field of chiral mesostructured inorganic materials started from the synthesis of individual nanocrystals and evolved to include their assembly from metals, semiconductors, ceramics, and inorganic salts endowed with various chiral structures ranging from atomic to micron scales. This tutorial review highlights the recent research on chiral mesostructured inorganic materials, especially the novel expression of mesostructured chirality and endowed optical chiral response, and it may inspire us with new strategies for the design of chiral inorganic materials and new opportunities beyond the traditional applications of chirality. Fabrication methods for chiral mesostructured inorganic materials are classified according to chirality type, scale, and symmetry&#8208;breaking mechanism. Special attention is given to highlight systems with original discoveries, exceptional phenomena, or unique mechanisms of optical chiral response for left&#8208; and right&#8208;handedness.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Decorated Nanostructure for Precision Sonodynamic&#8208;Catalytic Therapy of MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life&#8208;threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep&#8208;seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy of MRSA&#8208;infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium&#8208;rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)&#8208;absorbing gold&#8208;doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep&#8208;penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates 1O2 for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into toxic &#8729;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria&#8208;capturing ability, biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to the M2&#8208; type while suppressing the M1&#8208; type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.

&lt;p&gt;Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life-threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep-seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic-catalytic therapy of MRSA-infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium-rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)-absorbing gold-doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep-penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into toxic &#8729;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria-capturing ability, biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic-catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to the M2- type while suppressing the M1- type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic-catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;rate and Selective CO2 Electrolysis to Ethylene via Metal&#8208;Organic Framework&#8208;augmented CO2 Availability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;rate carbon dioxide (CO2)&#8208;to&#8208;ethylene (C2H4) conversion in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires fine control over the phase boundary of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to overcome the limit of CO2 solubility in aqueous electrolyte. Here, we present a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;functionalized GDE design, one based on a catalysts:MOFs:hydrophobic substrate materials layered architecture, that leads to high&#8208;rate and selective C2H4 production in flow cell and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers. We find, using electroanalysis and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), that MOF&#8208;induced organic layers in GDEs augment local CO2 concentration near the active sites of the Cu catalysts. We use MOFs with different CO2 adsorption abilities and vary the stacking ordering of MOFs in the GDE. While sputtered Cu on PTFE (Cu/PTFE) exhibited 43% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a current density of 200&#160;mA/cm2 in a flow cell, 49% C2H4 FE at 1 A/cm2 was achieved on MOF&#8208;augmented GDEs in CO2RR. We further evaluate MOF&#8208;augmented GDEs in MEA electrolyzer, achieving a C2H4 partial current density of 220&#160;mA/cm2 for CO2RR and 121&#160;mA/cm2 for carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR), representing 2.7&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold improvement in C2H4 production rate, compared to those obtained on bare Cu/PTFE.

         <title>N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) Acetamide Additive Enables Phase&#8208;Pure and Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>

Abstract
Formamidinium&#8208;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite is considered as one of the most promising perovskite materials for high&#8208;performance photodetectors because of its narrow band gap and superior thermal stability. Nevertheless, to realize efficient carrier transport and highly performing photodetectors, it imposes the requirement of fabricating &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with pure phase, preferred crystal orientation, large grain size and passivated interface, which still remains challenging. Here, a facile strategy based on additive engineering to obtain pure phase FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The formation of chemical bond and hydrogen bond between N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide and perovskite reduces the potential barrier in the phase transition process from the intermediate &#948; phase to the final black phase, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and pure phase &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits a maximum responsivity of 0.48 A W&#8722;1 at 700&#160;nm with a peak external quantum efficiency of 95% at 440&#160;nm. Moreover, the optimized device remains 83% of the initial performance after 576&#160;h storage at ambient condition. This work provides a simple and feasible scheme for the preparation of high&#8208;quality phase pure FAPbI3 perovskite and associated devices.

         <title>Rational Screening of Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphases on Zn for Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Zn anodes plays a pivotal role for high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;life aqueous batteries, because it effectively inhibits side reactions and dendritic growth. Many materials have been explored as SEIs by a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach. Herein, we propose an exercisable way to screen the potential SEIs on Zn anodes in view of dendrite&#8208;suppressing ability and charge&#8208;transfer property theoretically. As an output of this screening, Zn3(BO3)2 (ZBO) is checked experimentally. In symmetrical cells, Zn@ZBO runs over 250&#160;h at an ultrahigh current density of 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for a large areal capacity 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. In full cells, Zn@ZBO||MnO2 shows an impressive cumulative capacity (&#8764;406 mAh cm&#8722;2) under harsh conditions, i.e., a lean electrolyte condition (10&#160;&#956;L mAh&#8722;1), limited Zn supply (N/P ratio = 2.3) and high areal capacity (5.0 mAh cm&#8722;2). The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.

The significance of this work lies in not only the first report of ZBO on Zn showing excellent electrochemical performance, but also a feasible way to screen the promising SEI materials for other metal anodes.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Reinforcing of Immunogenic Cell Death and Transforming Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Via a Multifunctional Cascade Bioreactor for Optimizing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) has aroused widespread attention because it can reconstruct a tumor microenvironment and activate antitumor immunity. This study proposes a two&#8208;way enhancement of ICD based on a CaO2@CuS&#8208;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite to overcome the insufficient damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of conventional ICD&#8208;inducers. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (1064&#160;nm) of CuS nanoparticles generates 1O2 through photodynamic therapy (PDT) to trigger ICD, and it also damages the Ca2+ buffer function of mitochondria. Additionally, CaO2 nanoparticles react with H2O to produce a large amount of O2 and Ca2+, which respectively lead to enhanced PDT and Ca2+ overload during mitochondrial damage, thereby triggering a robust ICD activation. Moreover, oxidative&#8208;damaged mitochondrial DNA, induced by PDT and released from tumor cells, reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by transforming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to the M1 subphenotype. This study shows that CCMH with NIR&#8208;II irradiation can elicit adequate DAMPs and an active tumor&#8208;immune microenvironment for both 4T1 and CT26 tumor models. Combining this method with an immune checkpoint blockade can realize an improved immunotherapy efficacy and long&#8208;term protection effect for body.

         <title>Unravelling the Interfacial Dynamics of Band&#8208;gap Funneling in Bismuth&#8208;based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We have developed an environmentally friendly mixed&#8208;halide perovskite MA3Bi2Cl9&#8211;xIx with a band&#8208;gap funnel structure. However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of band&#8208;gap funneling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8211;xIx perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, we prepared single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;halide lead&#8208;free bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites&#8212;MA3Bi2Cl9&#8211;yIy and MA3Bi2I9 (named MBCl&#8208;I and MBI)&#8212;in the presence and absence of the band&#8208;gap funnel structure, respectively. Using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, we therefore confirmed the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces for MBCl&#8208;I and MBI halide perovskites. Concerning the mixed&#8208;halide hybrid perovskites MBCl&#8208;I with a band&#8208;gap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl&#8208;I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterisation and device performance.

         <title>Drug Delivery in Plants Using Silk Microneedles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
New systems for agrochemical delivery in plants will foster precise agricultural practices and provide new tools to study plants and design crop traits, as standard spray methods suffer from elevated loss and limited access to remote plant tissues. Silk&#8208;based microneedles can circumvent these limitations by deploying a known amount of payloads directly in plants&#8217; deep tissues. However, plant response to microneedles&#8217; application and microneedles&#8217; efficacy in deploying physiologically relevant biomolecules are unknown. Here, we show that gene expression associated with Arabidopsis thaliana wounding response decreases within 24 hours post microneedles&#8217; application. Additionally, microinjection of gibberellic acid (GA3) in A. thaliana mutant ft&#8208;10 provides a more effective and efficient mean than spray to activate GA3 pathways, accelerating bolting, and inhibiting flower formation. Microneedles&#8217; efficacy in delivering GA3 is also observed in several monocot and dicot crop species, i.e., tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), rice (Oryza Sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and soybean (Glycine max). The wide range of plants that can be successfully targeted with microinjectors opens the doors to their use in plant science and agriculture.

         <title>Engineering Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks for Solar Desalination with Directional Salt Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar desalination is one of the most promising strategies to address the global freshwater shortage crisis. However, the residual salt accumulated on the top surface of solar evaporators severely reduces light absorption and steam evaporation efficiency, thus impeding the further industrialization of this technology. Herein, a metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;engineered three&#8208;dimensional (3D) evaporator composed of photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges and side&#8208;twining hydrophilic threads for efficient desalination with directional salt crystallization and zero liquid discharge is reported. The MPN coatings afford the engineering of alternating photothermal superhydrophilic/superhydrophobic sponges with high heating efficiency and defined vapor escape channels, while the side&#8208;twining threads induce site&#8208;selective salt crystallization. The 3D evaporator exhibits a high and stable indoor desalination rate (&#8764;2.3&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) of concentrated seawater (20 wt%) under simulated sun irradiation for over 21 days without the need for salt crystallization inhibitors. This direct desalination is also achieved in outdoor field operations with a production rate of clean water up to &#8764;1.82&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 from concentrated seawater (10 wt%). Together with the high affinity and multiple functions of MPNs, this work is expected to facilitate the rational design of solar desalination devices and boost the research translation of MPN materials in broader applications.

         <title>Desolvation Synergy of Multiple H/Li&#8211;bonds on Iron&#8722;Dextran&#8722;based Catalyst Stimulates Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8211;sulfur battery catalysts are still facing substantial challenges in solving sulfur redox reactions which involve multistep electron transfers and multiphase transformations. Here, inspired by the combination of iron dextran (INFeD) and ascorbic acid (VC) as a blood tonic for the treatment of anemia, we developed a highly efficient VC@INFeD catalyst in the sulfur cathode, accomplishing the desolvation and enrichment of high&#8208;concentration solvated lithium polysulfides at the cathode/electrolyte interface with the assistance of multiple H/Li&#8722;bonds and resolving subsequent sulfur transformations through gradient catalysis sites where the INFeD promotes long&#8208;chain lithium polysulfide conversions and VC accelerates short&#8208;chain lithium polysulfide conversions. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that the VC@INFeD can substantially reduce the energy barrier of each sulfur redox step, inhibit shuttle effects, and endow the lithium&#8722;sulfur battery with high sulfur utilization and superior cycling stability even under a high sulfur loading (5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte (electrolyte/sulfur ratio, &#8764;7&#160;&#956;L mg&#8722;1) condition.

         <title>Photothermal Nanozyme&#8208;based Microneedle Patch against Refractory Bacterial Biofilm Infection via Iron&#8208;actuated Janus Ion Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to high antibiotic resistance and thermotolerance, bacterial biofilm infections (BBIs) are refractory to elimination. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and metabolism, and bacteria can thus accumulate iron from surrounding cells to maintain biofilm formation and survival. Consequently, iron deficiency in the biofilm microenvironment (BME) leads to the functional failure of innate immune cells. Herein, a novel antibiofilm strategy of iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy (IJIT) is proposed to regulate iron metabolism in both bacterial biofilm and immune cells. A BME&#8208;responsive photothermal microneedle patch (FGO@MN) is synthesized by the growth of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on graphene oxide nanosheets and then encapsulated in methacrylated hyaluronic acid needle tips. The catalytic product of &#183;OH by FGO@MN in BME disrupts the bacterial heat&#8208;shock proteins, coercing biofilm thermal sensitization. As synergistic mild photothermal treatment (mPTT) triggers iron uptake, the intracellular iron overload further induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, iron&#8208;nourished neutrophils around BME can be rejuvenated for reactivating the suppressed antibiofilm function. Thus, more than 95% BBIs elimination can be achieved by combining heat stress&#8208;triggered iron interference with iron&#8208;nutrient immune reactivation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments validate the scavenging of refractory BBI after 15 days, suggesting the promising perspective of IJIT in future clinical application.

         <title>Molecular Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold Resistant Plant to Stabilize Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dendrites growth and low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes and high freezing point of aqueous electrolyte hinder aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries practical application. Here, we present a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to aqueous electrolyte, to solve the above&#8208;mentioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that the side reaction and Zn dendrites growth are restrained because Bet could break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented two&#8208;dimension Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in Zn&#8208;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt; 99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776; 1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#8208;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2, 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular crowding effect, which ensures stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such molecular crowding electrolyte would inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

         <title>Hygroscopic Microgels&#8208;Enabled Rapid Water Extraction from Arid Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) has emerged as a promising decentralized water production technology to mitigate the freshwater crisis in arid areas. Hydrogels have been regarded as attractive sorbents due to their high water retention and tailorable polymer&#8208;water interactions. Yet, the kinetics of water sorption and desorption at low relative humidity (RH) should be improved for their practical implementation. Here, we report hygroscopic microgels (HMGs) composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and hygroscopic salt, achieving a water uptake of ac. 0.5&#8208;0.8&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% RH. HMGs enable rapid sorption&#8208;desorption kinetics owing to the short&#8208;distance diffusion in microgels and hydrophilicity&#8208;hydrophobicity switching of thermoresponsive HPC. To validate the feasibility of HMGs for moisture extraction, a potential daily water collection of up to equivalent 7.9 to 19.1 L kg&#8722;1 at low RH was demonstrated enabled by 24&#8211;36 operation cycles per day based on the material&#8208;level experiments. With renewable raw materials and superior performance, HMGs provide a sustainable approach for rapid moisture extraction in arid climates.

         <title>Switchable ion current saturation regimes enabled via heterostructured nanofluidic devices based on metal&#8208;organic frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The use of track&#8208;etched membranes allows further fine&#8208;tuning of transport regimes and thus enables their use in (bio)sensing and energy harvesting applications, among others. Recently, metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been combined with such membranes to further increase their potential. Herein, the creation of a single track&#8208;etched nanochannel modified with the UiO&#8208;66 MOF is proposed. By interfacial growth method, UiO&#8208;66 confined synthesis filled completely and smoothly the nanochannel, yet its constructional porosity renders a heterostructure along the axial coordinate of the channel. The MOF heterostructure confers notorious changes in the transport regime of the nanofluidic device. In particular, the tortuosity provided by the micro&#8208; and mesostructure of UiO&#8208;66 added to its charged state led to iontronic outputs characterized by an asymmetric ion current saturation for transmembrane voltages exceeding 0.3&#160;V. Remarkably, this behavior could be easily and reversibly modulated by changing the pH of the media and it could also be maintained for a wide range of KCl concentrations. In addition, we found that the modified&#8208;nanochannel functionality cannot be explained by considering just the intrinsic microporosity of UiO&#8208;66, but rather the constructional porosity that arises during the MOF growth process plays a central and dominant role.

         <title>Direct Observation of Self&#8208;Hybridized Exciton&#8208;Polaritons and Their Valley Polarizations in a Bare WS2 Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The strong excitonic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have led to the successful demonstration of exciton&#8208;polaritons (EPs) in various optical cavity structures. Recently, self&#8208;hybridized EPs were discovered in a bare TMD layer, but the experimental investigation is still lacking because of their nonradiative nature. Herein, we report the direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized EPs in a bare multilayer WS2 via the evanescent field coupling technique. Because of the thickness&#8208;dependent Rabi splitting energy, the dispersion curves of the EPs change sensitively with sample thickness. Moreover, continuous tuning of EP dispersion curves is demonstrated by controlling the excitation laser power. Lastly, it is observed that guided EPs retain valley polarization up to 0.2 at room temperature, representing a valley&#8208;preserved strong coupling regime. We believe that the high tunability and valley polarization properties of the guided EPs in bare TMD layers could facilitate new nanophotonic and valleytronic applications.

Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology might hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. We describe herein an optimized chiral growth method to prepare 4&#8208;fold twisted gold nanorods, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges were found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, we propose that dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible non&#8208;covalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and re&#8208;assembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV&#8208;light to visible /near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities included light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli responsive supramolecular systems.

&lt;p&gt;Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well-organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible non-covalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co-)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light-driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anti-counterfeiting, and light-triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light-activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo-induced changes, e.g&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;, geometry, dipole moment, and chirality.

         <title>Polar Species for Effective Dielectric Regulation to Achieve High&#8208;Performance CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar species modification (PSM) is employed to reduce the defect capturing probability by strengthening the defect dielectric screening effect via increasing the dielectric constant of a perovskite film. The introduction of F3EAI fills the vacancy defects at surface and also produces a hydrophobic umbrella with high resistance to humidity. PSM realizes a power conversion efficiency of 20.5% for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nonradiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There is focused research to boost the device performance by reducing the number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention is paid to the defect&#8208;capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect&#8208;capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species are designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect&#8208;capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric&#8208;screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect&#8208;capture radius. On the other, the fluorinated iodized salt replenishes the I&#8208;vacancy defects at the surface, hence lowering the defect density. Consequently, the power&#8208;conversion efficiency of an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSC is increased to as high as 20.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V and a fill factor of 82.87%, all of which are among the highest in their respective categories. Furthermore, the fluorinated species modification also produces a hydrophobic umbrella yielding significantly improved humidity tolerance, and hence long&#8208;term stability. The present strategy provides a general approach to effectually regulate the defect&#8208;capture radius, thus enhancing the optoelectronic performance.

         <title>A Peritumorally Injected Immunomodulating Adjuvant Elicits Robust and Safe Metalloimmunotherapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet robust immunomodulating adjuvant of Zn2+&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) is developed to potentiate cancer metalloimmunotherapy without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH simultaneously modulates immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and induces tumor immunogenic cell death, eliciting robust antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Clinical immunotherapy of solid tumors elicits durable responses only in a minority of patients, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although rational combinations of vaccine adjuvants with inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists that relieve immunosuppression represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against solid tumors, there are unavoidable nonspecific toxicities due to the pleiotropy of cytokines and undesired activation of off&#8208;target cells. Herein, a Zn2+ doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) based immunomodulating adjuvant, which not only relieves immunosuppression but also elicits robust antitumor immunity, is reported. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH sustainably neutralizes acidic TME and releases abundant Zn2+, promoting a pro&#8208;inflammatory network composed of M1&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and natural&#8208;killer cells. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LDH internalized by tumor cells effectively disrupts endo&#8208;/lysosomes to block autophagy and induces mitochondrial damage, and the released Zn2+ activates the cGas&#8208;STING signaling pathway to induce immunogenic cell death, which further promotes the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to induce antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unprecedentedly, merely injection of Zn&#8208;LDH adjuvant, without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists, significantly inhibits the growth, recurrence, and metastasis of solid tumors in mice. This study provides a rational bottom&#8208;up design of potent adjuvant for cancer metalloimmunotherapy against solid tumors.

         <title>Massively Parallel Selection of NanoCluster Beacons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Approximately 40&#8197;000 distinct NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are screened on next&#8208;generation sequencing chips and new NCBs that outperform the known best NCBs are identified. Dramatic fluorescence changes are observed by substituting a single nucleotide in an NCB, which can be explained by the proposed zipper&#8208;bag model. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, bright and multicolor NCBs are designed in silico.








Abstract
NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single&#8208;nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT&#8208;NCBs using the conventional low&#8208;throughput characterization approaches. Here, a high&#8208;throughput selection method is reported&#160;that takes advantage of repurposed next&#8208;generation&#8208;sequencing chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8776;40&#8201;000&#160;activator sequences. It is found that the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12&#160;of the 18&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6&#160;and 2&#8211;4&#160;are hotspots to generate yellow&#8211;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, a &#8220;zipper&#8208;bag&#8221; model is proposed that can explain how these hotspots facilitate the formation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter their chemical yields. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a pipeline is established to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

         <title>Tumor Selective Metabolic Reprogramming as a Prospective PD&#8208;L1 Depression Strategy to Reactivate Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the role of mitochondria in the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) regulation in tumors is newly revealed, making it possible to offer a prospective PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. Moreover, multi&#8208;functional IR&#8208;LND@Alb platform&#8208;induced tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming can depress PD&#8208;L1 expression and alleviate tumor hypoxia to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. In this research, it is newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression can be used as an effective PD&#8208;L1&#160;down&#8208;regulation method. To offer an ideal and high&#8208;effective tumor mitochondria&#8208;targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR&#8208;LND is prepared by conjugating mitochondria&#8208;targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR&#8208;68&#160;with mitochondrial complexes I and II depression agent lonidamine (LND), which then further self&#8208;assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is selectively and effectively depressed by IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. As expected, the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of such a PD&#8208;L1&#160;depression strategy is superior to conventional anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, IR&#8208;LND can also be served as a novel ideal promising photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug with self&#8208;oxygen and self&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation capacity. All in all, this tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming platform to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize for PDT effect, would open a new window for mitochondrial immunotherapy for cancer patients.

In this research, it is newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression can be used as an effective PD-L1&#160;down-regulation method.

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;Sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;Efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>

Sb2S3 planar solar cell with a power conversion efficiency first exceeding 8% is achieved based on the high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 absorber film fabricated using a novel multi&#8208;sulfur source collaborative chemical bath deposition technology.








Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Such solar cell has been faced with current challenge of low power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has stagnated for 8 years. It has been recognized that the synthesis of high&#8208;quality absorber film plays a critical role in efficiency improvement. Here, using fresh precursor materials for antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and combined sulfur (sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide), a unique chemical bath deposition procedure is created. Due to the complexation of sodium thiosulfate and the advantageous hydrolysis cooperation between these two sulfur sources, the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2&#8208; releasing processes are boosted. As a result, there are noticeable improvements in the deposition rate, film morphology, crystallinity, and preferred orientations. Additionally, the improved film quality efficiently lowers charge trapping capacity, suppresses carrier recombination, and prolongs carrier lifetimes, leading to significantly improved photoelectric properties. Ultimately, the PCE exceeds 8% for the first time since 2014, representing the highest efficiency in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells to date. This study is expected to shed new light on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 film and further efficiency improvement in Sb2S3 solar cells.

         <title>Cationic Polysaccharide Conjugates as Antibiotic Adjuvants Resensitize Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Prevent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic polysaccharide conjugates (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) are synthesized using controllable disulfide exchange polymerization as antibiotic adjuvants to treat multidrug&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii&#8208;induced pneumonia in mice. Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn disrupts bacterial membranes and efflux pumps, and facilitates antibiotic accumulation inside bacteria. Antibiotic efficacy is restored and bacterial resistance is prevented by Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn.








Abstract
In recent years, traditional antibiotic efficacy has rapidly diminished due to the advent of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria, which poses severe threat to human life and globalized healthcare. Currently, the development cycle of new antibiotics cannot match the ongoing MDR infection crisis. Therefore, novel strategies are required to resensitize MDR bacteria to existing antibiotics. In this study, novel cationic polysaccharide conjugates Dextran&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;guanidinoethyl)pentanamide) (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) is synthesized using disulfide exchange polymerization. Critically, bacterial membranes and efflux pumps are disrupted by a sub&#8208;inhibitory concentration of Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30, which enhances rifampicin (RIF) accumulation inside bacteria and restores its efficacy. Combined Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 and RIF prevents bacterial resistance in bacteria cultured over 30 generations. Furthermore, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 restores RIF effectiveness, reduces inflammatory reactions in a pneumonia&#8208;induced mouse model, and exhibits excellent in vivo biological absorption and degradation capabilities. As an antibiotic adjuvant, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 provides a novel resensitizing strategy for RIF against MDR bacteria and bacterial resistance. This Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 research provides a solid platform for future MDR applications.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of fumed silica and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, homogeneous Li+ flux regulation, and inorganic Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte enables superb cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8211;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+&#8208;transport channels, the prepared SLE exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the SLE can homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on the lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the SLE. Therefore, the lithium&#8208;metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8211;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S&#8208;rich SEI, as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still display&#160;a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2&#8201;C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Large Memory Window of van der Waals Heterostructure Devices Based on MOCVD&#8208;Grown 2D Layered Ge4Se9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge4Se9, a new insulating 2D&#8208;layered material, is synthesized using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at 240 &#176;C&#160;with&#160;low&#8208;reactive&#160;precursors.&#160;The 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 forms a low band offset with MoS2, exhibiting a large memory window with linear gate&#8208;tunability. As an artificial synapse, the MoS2/Ge4Se9 heterostructure exhibits synaptic updates with low non&#8208;linearity of 0.26 and low energy consumption of 15 fJ.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have drawn much interest over the last decade owing to their absence of dangling bonds and their intriguing low&#8208;dimensional properties. The emergence of 2D materials has enabled the achievement of significant progress in both the discovery of physical phenomena and the realization of superior devices. In this work, the group IV metal chalcogenide 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is introduced as a new selection of insulating vdW material. 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is synthesized with a rectangular shape using the metalcorganic chemical vapor deposition system using a liquid germanium precursor at 240 &#176;C. By stacking the Ge4Se9 and MoS2, vdW heterostructure devices are fabricated with a giant memory window of 129&#160;V by sweeping back gate range of &#177;80&#160;V. The gate&#8208;independent decay time reveals that the large hysteresis is induced by the interfacial charge transfer, which originates from the low band offset. Moreover, repeatable conductance changes are observed over the 2250 pulses with low non&#8208;linearity values of 0.26 and 0.95 for potentiation and depression curves, respectively. The energy consumption of the MoS2/Ge4Se9 device is about 15 fJ for operating energy and the learning accuracy of image classification reaches 88.3%, which further proves the great potential of artificial synapses.

         <title>Crystalline Lattice&#8208;Confined Atomic Pt in Metal Carbides to Match Electronic Structures and Hydrogen Evolution Behaviors of Platinum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides with &#8220;real&#8221; matched properties as metallic platinum are developed using Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#63743;W/Mo covalent bonds. The WC lattice&#8208;confined Pt atoms exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states, similar electronic structures, and matched hydrogen evolution behaviors as Pt(111) surface; remarkably, they offer 40 times greater mass activity than Pt@C&#8208;20% in alkaline conditions.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts occupy a pivotal position in diverse catalytic applications in hydrogen chemistry and electrochemistry, for instance, the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). While adsorbed Pt atoms on supports often cause severe mismatching on electronic structures and HER behaviors from metallic Pt due to the different energy level distribution of electron orbitals. Here, the design of crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides using the Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#8208;metal covalent bonds is reported. Remarkably, the lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in the tungsten carbides (Ptdoped@WCx, both Pt and W have atomic radii of 1.3&#160;&#197;) exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states and similar electronic structures as metallic Pt, thus delivering matched energy level distributions of the Pt 5dz2 and H 1s orbitals and similar acidic hydrogen evolution behaviors. In alkaline conditions, the Ptdoped@WCx exhibits 40 times greater mass activity (49.5&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 at &#951;&#160;=&#160;150&#160;mV) than the Pt@C because of the favorable water dissociation and H* transport. These findings offer a universal pathway to construct urgently needed atomic&#8208;scale catalysts for broad catalytic reactions.

         <title>Ionic&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Assisted Synthesis of FeSe&#8211;MnSe Heterointerfaces with Abundant Se Vacancies Embedded in N,B Co&#8208;Doped Hollow Carbon Microspheres for Accelerating the Sulfur Reduction Reaction</title>

         <dc:description>
N,B co&#8208;doped conductive hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies are rationally synthesized and used for Li&#8211;S batteries. The catalysts can subtly guide the Li2S nucleation and deposition in the 3D framework, avoiding the formation of L2S passivation layer and leaving enough channels for the continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S.








Abstract
Currently, extensive research efforts are being devoted to suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S onto the surface of sulfur host materials dramatically inhibits the continuous reduction of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, N,B co&#8208;doped hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies (FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC) are rationally designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using ionic liquids as dopants. The introduction of abundant heterostructures subtly guides Li2S nucleation and deposition in 3D frameworks, thus avoiding the formation of the Li2S passivation layer and allowing for continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S. Owing to these beneficial features, Li&#8211;S batteries comprising an FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC electrode exhibit significantly improved performance, including a high initial capacity of 1334 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and ultralong cycle stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.029% cycle&#8722;1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Remarkably, the FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC pouch cell delivers a considerable areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This study provides valuable insight into heterostructures and Se vacancies for developing practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Probing the Spin Dimensionality in Single&#8208;Layer CrSBr Van Der Waals Heterostructures by Magneto&#8208;Transport Measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;transport properties of 2D CrSBr vertical van der Waals heterostructures are inspected, revealing a spontaneous spin alignment along the b&#8208;axis together with spin&#8208;reorientation and field&#8208;induced phases. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed with large negative magnetoresistance. This makes CrSBr of high interest not only as a new 2D magnetic model but also as a potential spintronic component.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, the field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air&#8208;stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically&#8208;coupled ferromagnetic layers (Tc&#8764;150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single&#8208;layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover, exhibiting a low&#8208;temperature hidden&#8208;order below T*&#8764;40 K. Here, the magneto&#8208;transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit are inspected. The results demonstrate the marked low&#8208;dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short&#8208;range correlations above Tc and an Ising&#8208;type in&#8208;plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy axis b below Tc. By applying moderate magnetic fields along a and c axes, a spin&#8208;reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below T*.

     alt="Probing the Spin Dimensionality in Single-Layer CrSBr Van Der Waals Heterostructures by Magneto-Transport Measurements"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magneto-transport properties of 2D CrSBr vertical van der Waals heterostructures are inspected, revealing a spontaneous spin alignment along the &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-axis together with spin-reorientation and field-induced phases. In multilayers, a spin-valve behavior is observed with large negative magnetoresistance. This makes CrSBr of high interest not only as a new 2D magnetic model but also as a potential spintronic component.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air-stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically-coupled ferromagnetic layers (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&#8764;150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single-layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover, exhibiting a low-temperature hidden-order below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;*&#8764;40 K. Here, the magneto-transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit are inspected. The results demonstrate the marked low-dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short-range correlations above &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and an Ising-type in-plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy axis &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. By applying moderate magnetic fields along &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axes, a spin-reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;*. In multilayers, a spin-valve behavior is observed, with negative magnetoresistance strongly enhanced along the three directions below &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;*. These results show that CrSBr monolayer/bilayer provides an ideal platform for studying and controlling field-induced phenomena in two-dimensions, offering new insights regarding 2D magnets and their integration into vertical spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perovskite or Not Perovskite? A Deep&#8208;Learning Approach to Automatically Identify New Hybrid Perovskites from X&#8208;ray Diffraction Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning approach is developed to automatically and accurately assign the structure type from the X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns of new hybrid lead halides. An accuracy of 92% is obtained and the new insights provided by the model allow the ability of scientists to discriminate manually between different structure types of new materials to be augmented.








Abstract
Determining the crystal structure is a critical step in the discovery of new functional materials. This process is time consuming and requires extensive human expertise in crystallography. Here, a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based approach is developed, which allows it to be determined automatically if an unknown material is of perovskite type from&#160;powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. After training a deep&#8208;learning model on a dataset of known compounds, the structure types of new unknown compounds can be predicted using their experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This strategy is used to distinguish perovskite&#8208;type materials in a series of new hybrid lead halides. After validation, this approach is shown to accurately identify perovskites (accuracy of 92% with convolutional neural network). From the identification of the key features of the patterns used to discriminate perovskites versus nonperovskites, crystallographers can learn how to quickly identify low&#8208;dimensional perovskites from X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns.

         <title>Realizing a 10&#160;&#176;C Cooling Effect in a Flexible Thermoelectric Cooler Using a Vortex Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a film&#8208;based FTEC, which shows outstanding cooling performance by using an innovative quadra&#8208;layered structure and a light vortex generator (VG). The FTEC consumes 68.5&#160;W to maintain a comfortable Tskin in the major hot spots of the walking human body, as strongly opposed to its ultrahigh counterpart (1.5&#160;kW) by traditional centralized cooling systems.








Abstract
In this study, flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) are used to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of 10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W m&#8211;2. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra&#8208;layered Ag2Se/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse&#8208;width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Based Nanostructure for High&#8208;Performance and Universal Multivalent Metal Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;doped Zn&#8211;MOF (metal&#8211;organic framework) derived orderly mesoporous carbon&#8208;based nanostructure is synthesized by template&#8208;free pyrolysis and the Cu doping presents a direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation process of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. This orderly mesoporous derivative provides a fruitful platform to achieve a class of high&#8208;performance electrodes for universal multivalent metal ion storage in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivatives promise great potential in energy storage and conversion because of their excellent tunability in both the active metal sites, organic links, and the overall structures down to atomic and up to mesoscale. Nevertheless, a big challenge is to precisely control and thoroughly understand the actual MOF&#8208;to&#8208;derivative conversion process to realize the template&#8208;free synthesis of the MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous materials. Here, a class of ordered mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon nanoflakes is presented with slit&#8208;shaped pores synthesized by one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF, where the Cu doping plays a critically important direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. Benefiting from the uniquely ordered mesoporous structure and large specific surface area (910 m2 g&#8722;1), the Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous carbon nanoflakes present outstanding electrochemical storage performance for multivalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Al3+, and Zn2+, demonstrating the universal nature of the slit&#8208;shaped pores in enabling the multivalent metal ions for energy storage. Moreover, the assembled flexible Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, excellent cycling and mechanical stability, showing great application potential in the new generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Crossover Effects in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries with a Localized High Concentration Electrolyte and High&#8208;Nickel Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Profound effects of chemical crossover in a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte with a high&#8208;nickel cathode and lithium&#8208;metal anode are presented. Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt is stripped of fluorine at the anode and further decomposed at the cathode, causing a 3&#215; reduction in lithium solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth relative to symmetric cells and a 3&#215; increase in cathode capacity fade relative to cells with graphite anode.








Abstract
While crossover effects, such as transition&#8208;metal dissolution, are well&#8208;understood in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed&#8208;over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode and anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high&#8208;nickel cathode, lithium&#8208;metal anode, and a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with a high&#8208;nickel cathode has three times less solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth than a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2&#8211;3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium&#8208;metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium&#8208;metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium&#8208;metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with LHCE.

Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt is stripped of fluorine at the anode and further decomposed at the cathode, causing a 3&#215; reduction in lithium solid-electrolyte interphase growth relative to symmetric cells and a 3&#215; increase in cathode capacity fade relative to cells with graphite anode.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While crossover effects, such as transition-metal dissolution, are well-understood in lithium-ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed-over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium-metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode-to-anode and anode-to-cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high-nickel cathode, lithium-metal anode, and a localized high-concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium-metal anode paired with a high-nickel cathode has three times less solid-electrolyte interphase growth than a lithium-metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2&#8211;3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium-metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium-metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium-metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium-metal batteries with LHCE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming the Limitations of MXene Electrodes for Solution&#8208;Processed Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, various applications of MXenes have been intensively explored, except for optoelectronics, in which poor environmental stability severely impedes their practical application. This work provides a simple but effective approach to develop an environmentally stable MXene electrode that exhibits a high work function of 5.84 eV and distinguished solution processibility as the electrode for large&#8208;area organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
MXenes constitute a rapidly growing family of 2D materials that are promising for optoelectronic applications because of numerous attractive properties, including high electrical conductivity. However, the most widely used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene transparent conductive electrode exhibits insufficient environmental stability and work function (WF), which impede practical applications Ti3C2Tx electrodes in solution&#8208;processed optoelectronics. Herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene film with a compact structure and a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) barrier layer is presented as a promising electrode for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electrode shows excellent environmental stability, high WF of 5.84&#160;eV, and low sheet resistance RS of 97.4&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. The compact Ti3C2Tx structure after thermal annealing resists intercalation of moisture and environmental contaminants. In addition, the PFSA surface modification passivates interflake defects and modulates the WF. Thus, changes in the WF and RS are negligible even after 22&#160;days of exposure to ambient air. The Ti3C2Tx MXene is applied for large&#8208;area, 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;passive matrix flexible OLEDs on substrates measuring 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;cm. This work provides a simple but efficient strategy to overcome both the limited environmental stability and low WF of MXene electrodes for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronics.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Measurement of Cell Mechanics as a Clinically Relevant Readout of an In Vitro Lung Fibrosis Model Established on a Bioinspired Basement Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;breathing&#8221; human&#8208;based in vitro mini&#8208;lung with a patient&#8208;derived triple coculture fibrosis model introduces longitudinal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies to in vitro testing of inhaled drugs. This technology relies on a novel copolymeric basement membrane for cell culturing, which overcomes the shortcomings of silicon&#8208;based membranes, and on a novel method for real&#8208;time monitoring tissue mechanics as clinically relevant functional readout.








Abstract
Lung fibrosis, one of the major post&#8208;COVID&#160;complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with noninvasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics is introduced as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multiculture model under physiologic conditions, a biomimetic ultrathin basement (biphasic elastic thin for air&#8211;liquid culture conditions, BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is developed&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8211;liquid interface and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple coculture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (cyclic in vitro cell&#8208;stretch, CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. The real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) is shown as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which is confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib&#8212;an antifibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Protein Glues with Superior Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of protein complex glues with outstanding adhesion performance is fabricated by molecular engineering. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the protein complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. The combined robust interfacial adhesion and superior antibacterial activity endow the materials as highly favorable for visceral hemostasis and tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Naturally inspired proteins are investigated for the development of bioglues that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that a new generation of protein&#8208;based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly through de novo designed structural proteins in which arginine triggers robust liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enable quick visceral hemostasis in 10 s and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good biocompatibility, and superior antibacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically strong protein&#8208;based materials for surgical applications.

         <title>A Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enhanced Simultaneous and Multimodal Sensor Based on Moist&#8208;Electric Powered Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene oxide multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) capable of self&#8208;powered sensing of various environmental stimuli based on a spontaneously generated moist&#8208;electric potential is developed. Through the decoupling of characteristic response signals by machine&#8208;learning models, simultaneous monitoring of multiple stimuli by a single GO&#8208;MS is realized, providing a promising technical means for real&#8208;time multimodal perception and complex information system identification.








Abstract
Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of a future human&#8211;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multisensor networks with cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process have heavily restricted practical applications. Herein, a graphene oxide single&#8208;component multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) is developed, which enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental stimuli by a single unit with unique moist&#8208;electric self&#8208;power supply. This GO&#8208;MS can generate a sustainable moist&#8208;electric potential by spontaneously adsorbing water molecules in air, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to different stimuli. As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity are achieved by this single GO&#8208;MS with machine&#8208;learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, a moist&#8208;electric&#8208;powered human&#8211;machine interaction wristband based on GO&#8208;MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature, and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as gestures and sign language commanding communication. This ML&#8208;empowered moist&#8208;electric GO&#8208;MS provides a new platform for the development of self&#8208;powered single&#8208;component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in the fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and the Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things.

As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity are achieved by this single GO-MS with machine-learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, a moist-electric-powered human&#8211;machine interaction wristband based on GO-MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature, and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as gestures and sign language commanding communication. This ML-empowered moist-electric GO-MS provides a new platform for the development of self-powered single-component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in the fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and the Internet-of-Things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 Ternary Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. Ternary alloying produces a miscible phase over a wide range. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions and support that ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.








Abstract
Alloying of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a pioneering method for engineering electronic structures with expanded applications. In this study, MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition is successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H&#8211;1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consist of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibits a volcano&#8208;type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental d&#8208;band center (&#949;d). Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (&#916;GH*) and the activation barrier (Ea) support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.

         <title>Balancing the Selective Absorption and Photon&#8208;to&#8208;Electron Conversion for Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics with 5.0% Light&#8208;Utilization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing the selective absorption and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Following this, ST&#8208;OPV with a high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0% is reached via comprehensive optimization on materials, active layers, and device structures. Furthermore, the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good upscaling and thermal control ability, representing a promising candidate adaptive to versatile applications.








Abstract
Efficiently converting invisible light while allowing full visible light transmission is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST&#8208;OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations are carried out, including a ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, antireflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST&#8208;OPV shows a remarkably high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the upscaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating its promise for large&#8208;area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST&#8208;OPVs. Besides, it is demonstrated that the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good infrared light&#8208;reflection capability for thermal control. This work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.

         <title>Perovskite Wide&#8208;Angle Field&#8208;Of&#8208;View Camera</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras (fish eye camera and compound eye camera) simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution is still a huge challenge. To solve this problem, a new type of wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite&#8208;based photodetector and computational technology.








Abstract
Researchers have attempted to create wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras inspired by the structure of the eyes of animals, including fisheye and compound eye cameras. However, realizing wide&#8208;angle FOV cameras simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photodetector (FP&#8208;PD) using computational technology. With this camera, the proposed single&#8208;photodetector imaging technique can obtain high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution images using only a single detector, and the large&#8208;area FP&#8208;PD can be bent further to collect light from a wide&#8208;angle FOV. The proposed camera demonstrates remarkable features of an extraordinarily tunable wide FOV (greater than 150&#176;), high spatial resolution of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, and low distortion. It is believed that the proposed compatible and extensible camera prototype will promote the development of high&#8208;performance versatile FOV cameras.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Negative Differential Resistance and High Tunneling Current Density in GeSn Esaki Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative differential resistance (NDR) in GeSn Esaki diodes at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios is reported. By applying tensile stresses on GeSn epitaxial films, a record&#8208;high tunneling current density of 0.5 MA cm&#8722;2 is achieved among all group&#8208;IV Esaki diodes since phonon participation is no longer required in direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8211;tin.








Abstract
Tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low&#8208;power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub&#8208;60 mV per decade. For silicon&#8208; or germanium&#8208;based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8211;tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high&#8208;performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios of 15&#8211;53 from 300 K to 4 K. A record&#8208;high peak current density of 545 kA cm&#8722;2 at 4 K is also reported for the tensile&#8208;strained Ge0.925Sn0.075 device (strain &#8776;0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile&#8208;strained n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Over 1.2&#160;V Achieved by a Dual&#8208;Side Passivation Layer</title>

         <dc:description>
New synthesized non&#8208;conjugated polyelectrolyte is introduced as an interfacial layer between the charge&#8208;transport layer and perovskite absorbent, which significantly reduce both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses, but also aligns the interface's energy level. The modified perovskite solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of 24.4% (open&#8208;circuit voltage 1.21&#160;V) with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge&#8208;transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) is synthesized and this is introduced as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppresses both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenges ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs also show excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 h under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>Construction of Ultrathin S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions of Single Ni Atom Immobilized Ti&#8208;MOF and BiVO4 for CO2 Photoconversion of nearly 100% to CO by Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>

Wide&#8208;spectrum heterojunctions are successfully fabricated by coupling single&#8208;atom Ni immobilized single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer NTU&#8208;9 as a reformative reduction half semiconductor with 2DBiVO4 through H&#8208;bonding induction, which represents a novel S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst model. Favorable charge separation and efficient catalytic sites of single Ni atoms with unique local microenvironment synergistically promote CO2 photoconversion, achieving up to 66&#8208;fold conversion rate by pure water compared to reference BiVO4 nanoparticles, together with nearly 100% selectivity to CO without any H2.








Abstract
To rationally design single&#8208;atom metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;involving photocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge for efficient CO2 conversion. Here, cuppy microstructures, consisting of a Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and three linked carboxylic moieties, in the single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer Ti2(H2dobdc)3 MOF (NTU&#8208;9) are exploited to immobilize abundant single Ni(II) sites (Ni@MOF). The coupling of Ni@MOF with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets by H&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced assembly process obtains wide&#8208;spectrum 2D heterojunctions. The optimal heterojunction exhibits competitive performance and enables around 66&#8208;fold CO2 conversion of that for BVO nanoparticles by pure water, with nearly 100% CO selectivity. The exceptional photoactivity is attributed to favorable S&#8208;scheme charge transfer from BVO to MOF then to single Ni(II) sites. Noteworthily, single Ni(II) sites anchored by the Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and vicinal carboxylic moieties serving as a unique local microenvironment (LME) are found to synergistically catalyze CO2 conversion. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of carboxylic moieties can form H&#8208;bonds with CO2 to promote its adsorption on single Ni(II) sites, and also can provide accessible protons to facilitate H&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO desorption and subsequent CO2 adsorption on single Ni(II) sites with LME is proved to be thermodynamically favored, and hence dominates the high CO selectivity. This work highlights the significance of modulating the LME of single atoms to rationally design photocatalysts for realizing carbon neutralization.

         <title>Inverse Design of Mechanical Metamaterials with Target Nonlinear Response via a Neural Accelerated Evolution Strategy</title>

Materials with target nonlinear mechanical response can support the design of innovative soft robots, wearable devices, footwear, and energy&#8208;absorbing systems, yet it is challenging to realize them. In this work, a neural network is combined with an evolution strategy to efficiently identify geometries resulting in a wide range of target nonlinear mechanical responses and design optimized energy&#8208;absorbing systems, soft robots, and morphing structures.








Abstract
Materials with target nonlinear mechanical response can support the design of innovative soft robots, wearable devices, footwear, and energy&#8208;absorbing systems, yet it is challenging to realize them. Here, mechanical metamaterials based on hinged quadrilaterals are used as a platform to realize target nonlinear mechanical responses. It is first shown that by changing the shape of the quadrilaterals, the amount of internal rotations induced by the applied compression can be tuned, and a wide range of mechanical responses is achieved. Next, a neural network is introduced that provides a computationally inexpensive relationship between the parameters describing the geometry and the corresponding stress&#8211;strain response. Finally, it is shown that by combining the neural network with an evolution strategy, one can efficiently identify geometries resulting in a wide range of target nonlinear mechanical responses and design optimized energy&#8208;absorbing systems, soft robots, and morphing&#160;structures.

         <title>Observation of Superconducting Collective Modes from Competing Pairing Instabilities in Single&#8208;Layer NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental observation of Leggett collective modes in the superconducting state of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is reported. Leggett modes have been rarely seen in nature and represent the first type of collective modes observed in 2D TMD superconductors, which highlights the rather unconventional superconducting properties of this family of materials in the single&#8208;layer limit.








Abstract
In certain unconventional superconductors with sizable electronic correlations, the availability of closely competing pairing channels leads to characteristic soft collective fluctuations of the order parameters, which leave fingerprints in many observables and allow the phase competition to be scrutinized. Superconducting layered materials, where electron&#8211;electron interactions are enhanced with decreasing thickness, are promising candidates to display these correlation effects. In this work, the existence of a soft collective mode in single&#8208;layer NbSe2, observed as a characteristic resonance excitation in high&#8208;resolution tunneling spectra is reported. This resonance is observed along with higher harmonics, its frequency &#937;/2&#916;&#160;is anticorrelated with the local superconducting gap &#916;, and its amplitude gradually vanishes by increasing the temperature and upon applying a magnetic field up to the critical values (TC and HC2), which sets an unambiguous link to the superconducting state. Aided by a microscopic model that captures the main experimental observations, this resonance is interpreted as a collective Leggett mode that represents the fluctuation toward a proximate f&#8208;wave triplet state, due to subleading attraction in the triplet channel. These findings demonstrate the fundamental role of correlations in superconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, opening a path toward unconventional superconductivity in simple, scalable, and transferable 2D superconductors.

Fluorescent Nanomaterials
By repurposing next&#8208;generation sequencing chips, millions of fluorescent NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) can be screened in a single experiment. Combining this high&#8208;throughput screening platform with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, in article number 2204957, Hsin&#8208;Chih Yeh and co&#8208;workers establish a pipeline to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

Biomimetic Membranes
In article number 2205083, Ali Doryab, Otmar Schmid, and co&#8208;workers describe how a biomimetic basement (BETA) membrane with a thickness of only 1 &#956;m and excellent biocompatibility demonstrates the formation of the nanoscale fibrous network structure of extracellular matrix proteins (green) deposited by the cells (violet). These unique features of the BETA membrane including Young's modulus &lt;10 kPa allow monitoring of cell mechanics in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Recent Progress in Smart Polymeric Gel&#8208;Based Information Storage for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials to deal with the endless phenomena of information leakage and misinformation are a very important and promising field. As one of the most attractive candidates, smart gels possess excellent modifiability and unique stimulus responsiveness. Moreover, elaborate polymeric gels with chemical or physical colors can display polychrome and multistage information through the synergy of multiple functions.








Abstract
Information security protection has a tremendous impact on human life, social stability and national security, leading to the rapid development of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and related techniques. However, the traditional stored information on hard or dry media is often static and lacks functions, which makes it challenging to deal with increasing and powerful counterfeiting technologies. Modified intelligent polymeric gels exhibit color changes and shape morphing under external stimuli, which give them great potential for applications in information storage. This paper provides an overview of the latest progress in polymeric gel&#8208;based information storage materials in relation to counterfeiting. Following a brief introduction of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the preparation methods for intelligent gels with adjustable colors (e.g., chemical colors and physical colors) and various encryption/decryption modes involving dimensions and diverse colors are outlined. Finally, the challenges and prospects for information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting based on smart gels are discussed.

         <title>Emerging Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Thermal&#8208;Energy Harvesting, Storage, and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An holistic analysis on the recent developments of solid&#8208;state phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for innovative thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) applications. The phase&#8208;transition fundamentals of solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) PCMs are introduced and discussed, developing strategies and molecular engineering design toward potential applications. The current challenges and future research directions on S&#8211;S PCMs in TES applications are also proposed.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8211;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8211;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention toward practical thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, the aim is to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8211;solid PCMs suitable for thermal&#8208;energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. The developing strategies of solid&#8211;solid PCMs are presented and then the structure&#8211;property relationship is discussed, followed by potential applications. Finally, an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions is presented. Hopefully, this review will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8211;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications.

         <title>An Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Reinforced Hydrophobic Cationic Sieve Lowers the Concentration Threshold of Water&#8208;In&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small number of hydrophobic cations are introduced to appropriate concentration electrolyte (ACE) (13.8&#160;m). The added cations can form an electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses HER. Thus, the ALIBs with HCS&#8208;ACE can possess a compatible stable electrochemical window and achieve lower cost and better kinetic performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes expand the stable electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes, leading to the advent of high&#8208;voltage (above 2&#160;V) aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs). However, the high lithium salt concentration electrolytes of ALIBs result&#160;in their high cost and deteriorate kinetic performance. Therefore, it is challenging for ALIBs to explore aqueous electrolytes with appropriate concentration to balance the electrochemical window and kinetic performance as well as the cost. In contrast to maintaining high concentrations of aqueous electrolytes (&gt;20&#160;m), a small number of hydrophobic cations are introduced to a much lower electrolyte concentration (13.8&#160;m), and it is found that, compared with WIS electrolytes, ALIBs with these concentration&#8208;lowered electrolytes possess a compatible stable electrochemical window (3.23&#160;V) and achieve better kinetic performance. These findings originate from the added cations, which form an electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the lower electrolyte concentration provides significant benefits to ALIBs, including lower cost, better rate capability (lower viscosity of 18&#160;cP and higher ionic conductivity of 22&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C), and improved low&#8208;temperature performance (liquidus temperature of &#8722;10.18&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Based Drug Delivery Systems for Enhanced Antitumor Therapies through Modulating the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular&#8208;vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems show huge potential for improved antitumor immunotherapy. Five key steps during the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle of extracellular vesicles are reviewed; namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy harnessing activity of the immune system against tumors has made great progress, the treatment efficacy remains limited in most cancers. Current anticancer immunotherapy is primarily based on T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated cellular immunity, which highly relies on efficiency of triggering the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells. Unfortunately, these immunotherapies are restricted by inefficient drug delivery and acting on only a single step of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. Due to high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, intrinsic cell targeting, and easy chemical and genetic manipulation, extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based drug delivery systems are widely used to amplify anticancer immune responses by serving as an integrated platform for multiple drugs or therapeutic strategies to synergistically activate several steps of cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. This review summarizes various mechanisms related to affecting cancer&#8208;immunity cycle disorders. Meanwhile, preparation and application of EV&#8208;based drug delivery systems in modulating cancer&#8208;immunity cycle are introduced, especially in the improvement of T cell recruitment and infiltration into tumors. Finally, opportunities and challenges of EV&#8208;based drug delivery systems in translational clinical applications are briefly discussed.

         <title>Integrated Memory Devices Based on 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Inverse Domain Scaling in Polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline ErMnO3 displays an anomalous domain size/grain size scaling behavior in comparison to classical ferroelectric materials, such as BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. The fundamental difference is due to the formation of topologically protected vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs in polycrystalline ErMnO3 and their interaction with elastic strain fields.








Abstract
The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti&#8208;vortex structures, and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals is studied, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. It is observed that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far&#8208;reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology&#8208;based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.

         <title>Gate Dielectrics Integration for Two&#8208;Dimensional Electronics: Challenges, Advances and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond&#8208;silicon field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development towards practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, we will briefly analyze the root causes of such issues, summarize recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high&#8208;performance 2D electronics. Then, in the perspective, we will outline the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices, and provide an outlook for their future development.

         <title>A Water&#8208;soluble AIEgen for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Kidney Fibrosis via SWIR Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>

Abstract
Early diagnosis of renal fibrosis is crucially significant on account of its worldwide prevalent tendency. Optical imaging in the near&#8208;infrared window has been recognized as an appealing technique for the timely detection of renal dysfunction. However, formulating a contrast agent that allows early monitoring of renal fibrosis and concurrently renal&#8208;clearable in normal group is still challenging. Herein, a nanosized fluorophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, was well&#8208;tailored and amenable to longitudinal visualizing the fibrosis progression specifically in the early&#8208;stage via short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The small size (&#8764;26&#160;nm), renal filtrable molecular weight (3.3&#160;kDa), high renal clearance efficiency (93.1 &#177; 1.7% excretion through the kidney within 24&#160;h), outstanding imaging performance and good biocompatibility, together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive and far superior to clinical diagnostic assays. The finding in this study would provide a blueprint for the next generation of diagnostic agent for the extent of renal fibrosis.

         <title>Dynamic assembly of viscoelastic networks by aqueous liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;solid phase separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2)</title>

Abstract
Living cells comprise diverse subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal networks, that can regulate essential cellular activities through dynamic assembly and synergistic interactions with biomolecular condensates. Despite extensive efforts, reproducing viscoelastic networks for modulating biomolecular condensates in synthetic systems remains challenging. Here, we propose a new aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS), which consists of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and dextran (DEX), to construct viscoelastic networks capable of being assembled and dissociated dynamically to regulate the self&#8208;assembly of condensates on&#8208;demand. Viscoelastic networks are generated using liquid&#8208;liquid phase&#8208;separated DEX droplets as templates and the following liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the PNIPAM&#8208;rich phase. The resulting networks can dissolve liquid fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates within 5 minutes. Our works demonstrate rich phase separation behaviors in a single ATPS through incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers. Our concept could potentially be applied to other macromolecules through other stimuli to develop materials with rich phase behaviors and hierarchical structures.

         <title>Self&#8208;powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>

Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this paper, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. The rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles were systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converged in a row after passing through the serpentine channel. And various particles were separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells was achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>Robust and Multifunctional Kirigami Electronics with Tough and Permeable Aramid Nanofiber Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Kirigami designs are advantageous for the construction of wearable electronics due to their high stretchability and conformability on 3D dynamic surfaces of the skin. However, suitable materials technologies that enable robust kirigami devices with desired functionality for skin&#8208;interfaces remain limited. Here, a versatile materials platform based on composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) was exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. The self&#8208;assembled fibrillar network involving aramid nanofibers and polyvinyl alcohol combines high toughness, permeability, and manufacturability, which are desirable for the fabrication of hybrid devices. Multiscale simulations were conducted to explain the high fracture resistance of CNFF&#8208;based kirigami structures and provided essential guidance for the design, which can be further generalized to other kirigami devices. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers were integrated onto CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve measurements of electrocardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG), skin temperature, and other physiological parameters. These mechanically robust, multifunctional, lightweight, and biocompatible kirigami devices could shed new insights for the development of advanced wearable systems and human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Dense Local Triplet States and Steric Shielding of Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Performance Deep Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance (MR) thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) molecules based on boron and nitrogen atoms are emerging as next&#8208;generation blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrow emission spectra and triplet harvesting properties. However, intermolecular aggregation stemming from the planar structure of typical MR&#8208;TADF molecules that led to concentration quenching and broadened spectra limits the utilization of the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Herein, we developed a deep blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me, to effectively suppress intermolecular interactions. Furthermore, photophysical investigation and theoretical calculations revealed that adding biphenyl moieties to the core body creates dense local triplet states in the vicinity of S1 and T1 energetically, letting the emitter harvest excitons efficiently. OLEDs based on pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me showed a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a pure blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.132, 0.092), which are maintained even at a high doping concentration of 100&#160;wt.%. Furthermore, by incorporating conventional TADF sensitizer, we realized deep blue OLEDs with a CIE value of (0.133, 0.109) and an extremely high EQE of 30.1%. Our findings provide insight into design strategies for developing efficient deep blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters with fast triplet upconversion and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation.

OLEDs based on &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;BP-DABNA-Me showed a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a pure blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.132, 0.092), which are maintained even at a high doping concentration of 100&#160;&lt;i&gt;wt&lt;/i&gt;.%. Furthermore, by incorporating conventional TADF sensitizer, we realized deep blue OLEDs with a CIE value of (0.133, 0.109) and an extremely high EQE of 30.1%. Our findings provide insight into design strategies for developing efficient deep blue MR-TADF emitters with fast triplet upconversion and suppressed self-aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>In situ Observation of Structural Evolution and Phase Engineering of Amorphous Materials during Crystal Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The nucleation pathway determines the structures and thus properties of the formed nanomaterials, which is governed by the free energy of the intermediate phase during nucleation. The amorphous structure, as one of the intermediate phases during nucleation, plays an important role in modulating the nucleation pathway. However, the process and mechanism of crystal nucleation from amorphous structures still need to be fully investigated. Here, we employ in situ aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) to conduct real&#8208;time imaging of the nucleation of ultrathin amorphous nanosheets (NSs). Our results indcate that their nucleation contains three distinct stages, i.e., aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals. In particular, we systematically investigate the crystallization processes of various amorphous materials to form corresponding nanocrystals with unconventional crystalline phases, including face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) Ru, hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) Rh and a new intermetallic IrCo alloy. In situ electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis unveils that the doped carbon in the original amorphous NSs can migrate to the surface during the nucleation process, stabilizing the obtained unconventional crystal phases transformed from the amorphous structures, which is also proven by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Metabolic homeostasis&#8208;regulated nanoparticles for antibody&#8208;independent cancer radio&#8208;immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
The special metabolic traits of cancer cells and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are promising targets for developing novel cancer therapy strategies, especially the glycolysis and mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, therapies targeting a singular metabolic pathway are always counteracted by the metabolic reprogramming of cancer, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Herein, we employ polyethylene glycol&#8208;coated (PEGylated) liposomes as the drug delivery system (DDS) for both mannose and levamisole hydrochloride to simultaneously inhibit glycolysis and restrain mitochondrial energy metabolism and thus inhibit the tumor growth. In combination with radiotherapy, the liposomes could not only modulate the immunosuppressive TME by cellular metabolism regulation to achieve potent therapeutic effect for local tumors, but also suppress the M2 macrophage proliferation triggered by X&#8208;ray irradiation and thus enhance the immune response to inhibit metastatic lesions. In brief, we provide a new therapeutic strategy targeting the special metabolic traits of cancer cells and immunosuppressive TAMs to enhance the abscopal effect of radiotherapy for cancer.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Quaternary Two&#8208;Dimensional BiCuSeO p&#8208;type Semiconductor with Intrinsic Degeneracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) BiCuSeO is an intrinsic p&#8208;type degenerate semiconductor due to its self&#8208;doping effect, which possesses great potential to fabricate high&#8208;performance 2D&#8208;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs). However, the controllable synthesis of multinary 2D materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still a challenge due to the restriction of thermodynamics. Here, we realize the CVD synthesis of quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets. As&#8208;grown BiCuSeO nanosheets with thickness down to &#8764;6.1&#160;nm (&#8764;7 layers) and domain size of &#8764;277&#160;&#956;m show excellent ambient stability. Intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, capable of maintaining even in a few layers, is comprehensively unveiled. By varying the thicknesses and temperatures, carrier concentration of BiCuSeO nanosheets can be adjusted in the range of 1019&#8211;1021 cm&#8722;3. And the Hall mobility of BiCuSeO is &#8764;191 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (at 2 K). Furthermore, taking advantage of the p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, a prototypical BiCuSeO/MoS2 TFET is fabricated. The emerging of negative differential resistance trend and multifunctional diodes by modulating the gate voltage and temperature manifest the great practical implementation potential of BiCuSeO nanosheets. These results pave way for the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of high&#8208;performance tunnel devices.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferrable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. We propose a strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window. The strategy uses a type of unipolar switches featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor of ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the exemplary switch to highlight the advantage and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Reservoir Computing with Charge&#8208;trap Memory Based on a MoS2 Channel for Neuromorphic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Novel memory devices are essential for developing low power, fast and accurate in&#8208;memory computing and neuromorphic engineering concepts that can compete with the conventional CMOS digital processors. 2D semiconductors provide a novel platform for advanced semiconductors with atomic thickness, low current operation and capability of 3D integration. This work presents a charge trap memory (CTM) device with MoS2 channel where memory operation arises thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. We demonstrate transistor operation, memory characteristics and synaptic potentiation/depression for neuromorphic applications. The CTM device shows outstanding linearity of the potentiation by applied drain pulses of equal amplitude. We finally demonstrate pattern recognition by reservoir computing where the input pattern is applied as a stimulation of the MoS2&#8208;based CTMs, while the output current after stimulation is processed by a feedforward readout network. The good accuracy, the low current operation and the robustness to input random bit flip makes the CTM device a promising technology for future high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing concepts.

         <title>Multiscale Architectured Membranes, Electrodes, and Transport Layers for Next&#8208;generation Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable advances have been achieved in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on the development of material technology. Recently, an emerging multiscale architecturing technology covering nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales has been regarded as an alternative strategy to overcome the hindrance to achieving high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs. This review summarizes the recent progress in the key components of PEMFCs based on a novel architecture strategy. In the first section, diverse architectural methods for patterning the membrane surface with random, single&#8208;scale, and multiscale structures as well as their efficacy for improving catalyst utilization, charge transport, and water management are discussed. In the subsequent section, the electrode structures designed with one&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) multiscale structures to enable low Pt usage, improve oxygen transport, and achieve high electrode durability are elucidated. Finally, recent advances in the architectured transport layer for improving mass transportation including pore gradient, perforation, and patterned wettability for gas diffusion layer and 3D structured/engineered flow fields are described.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, considerable advances have been achieved in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on the development of material technology. Recently, an emerging multiscale architecturing technology covering nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales has been regarded as an alternative strategy to overcome the hindrance to achieving high-performance and reliable PEMFCs. This review summarizes the recent progress in the key components of PEMFCs based on a novel architecture strategy. In the first section, diverse architectural methods for patterning the membrane surface with random, single-scale, and multiscale structures as well as their efficacy for improving catalyst utilization, charge transport, and water management are discussed. In the subsequent section, the electrode structures designed with one-dimensional and three-dimensional (3D) multiscale structures to enable low Pt usage, improve oxygen transport, and achieve high electrode durability are elucidated. Finally, recent advances in the architectured transport layer for improving mass transportation including pore gradient, perforation, and patterned wettability for gas diffusion layer and 3D structured/engineered flow fields are described.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Biomimetic Bacteriophage&#8208;Like Particles Formed from Probiotic Extracts and NO Donors for Eradicating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) donors are combined with probiotic extracts to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles, which are used to construct a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) to meet different conditions. The DMAH can treat bacterial wounds through phage&#8208;like therapy in the dark. Meanwhile, DMAH can perform rapid disinfection through the synergistic photothermal/NO therapy under near&#8208;infrared light to cure infected wounds.








Abstract
Effectively clearing multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria through nonantibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell&#8208;messenger nitric oxide (NO) is combined with extracts of food&#8208;grade Lactobacillus casei to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles with a tailspike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiates the programmed death of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;doped polymers, a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results reveal that the DMAH achieves a long&#8208;time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage&#8208;like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected to 20&#160;min of near&#8208;infrared irradiation release NO, which, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damages bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multifunctional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage&#8208;like particles.

         <title>Readily Accessible Metallic Micro&#8208;Island Arrays for High&#8208;Performance Metal Oxide Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) TFT performance can be substantially enhanced by placing aluminum micro&#8208;island arrays (Al&#8208;MIAs) directly on top of the IGZO back channel. The MIA channel coverages/dimensions can be readily optimized by vapor depositing Al through tailored honeycomb cinnamate&#8208;cellulose film shadow masks, demonstrating the great versatility of this route to enhance metal oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor performance.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here, a new strategy is reported to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#181;e) increases from &#8776;3.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 to near 15.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25 &#181;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and technology computer&#8208;aided design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#181;e of &gt;50.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 . This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicrometer resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.








Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through&#160;covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky&#8208;end&#8208;coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments&#160;using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18&#160;self&#8208;assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8211;9.32&#160;&#197; are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross&#8208;sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine&#8208;tuned for the self&#8208;assembly of designer nanocages, guest&#8211;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.

Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing systems with the potential to drive the next wave of artificial intelligence demand a spectrum of critical components beyond simple characteristics. An emerging research trend is to achieve advanced functions with ultra&#8208;compact neuromorphic device. We demonstrate a single&#8208;transistor neuron that implements excitatory&#8208;inhibitory (E&#8208;I) spatiotemporal integration and series of essential neuron behaviors. Neuronal oscillations, the fundamental mode of neuronal communication that construct high&#8208;dimensional population code to achieve efficient computing in brain, can also be demonstrated by our neuron transistors. The highly&#8208;scalable E&#8208;I neuron can be the basic building block for implementing core neuronal circuit motifs and large&#8208;scale architectural plans to replicate energy&#8208;efficient neural computations, forming the foundation of future integrated neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Direct Presentation of Tumor&#8208;Associated Antigens to Induce Adaptive Immunity by Personalized Dendritic Cell&#8208;Mimicking Nanovaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC)&#8208;based vaccines are an approved method for inducing potent antigen&#8208;specific immune responses to eliminate tumor cells. However, this promising strategy still faces challenges such as tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) loading, lymph node homing, quality control and other limitations. Here, we develop a personalized DC&#8208;mimicking nanovaccine (nanoDC) for stimulation of TAAs&#8208;specific T cell populations. The nanoDCs are fabricated using nanoparticles with dendritic structure and membranes from mature bone marrow&#8208;derived cells (BMDCs). Mature BMDCs are stimulated by nanostructures assembled from Escherichia coli (E. coli) and tumor cells to efficiently deliver TAAs and induce BMDCs maturation through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. By maintaining co&#8208;stimulatory markers, molecules class I (MHC&#8208;I) antigen complexes, and lymphocyte homing receptors, nanoDCs efficiently migrate to lymph nodes and generate potent antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses. Consequently, vaccination with nanoDCs strongly inhibit the tumor growth and metastases formation in vivo. In particular, nanoDCs can also induce memory T cells for long&#8208;term protective immunity. This study demonstrates that DC&#8208;mimicking nanovaccines can trigger adaptive immune protection against tumors for personalized immunotherapy and precision medicine.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccines are an approved method for inducing potent antigen-specific immune responses to eliminate tumor cells. However, this promising strategy still faces challenges such as tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) loading, lymph node homing, quality control and other limitations. Here, we develop a personalized DC-mimicking nanovaccine (nanoDC) for stimulation of TAAs-specific T cell populations. The nanoDCs are fabricated using nanoparticles with dendritic structure and membranes from mature bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs). Mature BMDCs are stimulated by nanostructures assembled from &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;) and tumor cells to efficiently deliver TAAs and induce BMDCs maturation through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. By maintaining co-stimulatory markers, molecules class I (MHC-I) antigen complexes, and lymphocyte homing receptors, nanoDCs efficiently migrate to lymph nodes and generate potent antigen-specific T cell responses. Consequently, vaccination with nanoDCs strongly inhibit the tumor growth and metastases formation in vivo. In particular, nanoDCs can also induce memory T cells for long-term protective immunity. This study demonstrates that DC-mimicking nanovaccines can trigger adaptive immune protection against tumors for personalized immunotherapy and precision medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reveal the Mechanism of sp&#8208;N Doping in Graphdiyne for Developing Site&#8208;Defined Metal&#8208;Free Catalysts</title>

Abstract
Due to the limited reserves of metals, scientists are devoted to exploring high&#8208;performance metal&#8208;free catalysts based on carbon materials to solve environment&#8208;related issues. Doping would build up inhomogeneous charge distribution on surface, which is an efficient approach for boosting the catalytic performance. However, doping sites are difficult to control in traditional carbon materials, thus hindering their development. Taking the advantage of unique sp&#8208;C in graphdiyne (GDY), we have site&#8208;defined introduced a new N doping configuration of sp&#8208;hybridized nitrogen (sp&#8208;N), bringing a Pt&#8208;comparable catalytic activity in oxygen reduction reaction. However, the reaction intermediate of this process has never been captured, hindering the understanding of the mechanism and also the precise synthesis of metal&#8208;free catalysts. After the four&#8208;year study, we realized the fabrication of intermediate&#8208;like molecule for the first time, and finally obtained sp&#8208;N doped GDY via the pericyclic reaction. Compared with GDY doped with other N configurations, the designed sp&#8208;N GDY shows much higher catalytic activity in electroreduction of CO2 towards CH4 production, owing to the unique electronic structure introduced by sp&#8208;N, which is more favorable in stabilizing the intermediate. Thus, besides opening the black&#8208;box for the site&#8208;defined doping, this work reveals the relationship between doping configuration and products of CO2 reduction.

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8208;organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C&#8729;gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for more than 10 cycles with &#8764;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theorical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photo&#8208;accumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by In Situ Liquid&#8208;Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) facilitates real&#8208;time observation of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 monolayer. Time&#8208;series LPTEM shows sequential activation, H2 bubble formation, and electrolyte flow on different types of catalytic active sites. Directionality of H2 bubbling and competitive wetting between the bubbles and electrolyte on catalyst surface significantly affect the HER activity of the&#160;active sites.








Abstract
Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which is determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the surface of MoS2 are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Organic Neuroelectronics: From Neural Interfaces to Neuroprosthetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic neuroelectronics have been researched to treat and diagnose neurological diseases. The organic materials provide large advantages for neural interfaces. Also, organic nervetronics provides efficient data processing by emulating functional behavior of neural systems. Recent progress in organic neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics, with aspects of materials, devices, and systems, and finally suggests future directions, is presented.








Abstract
Requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuroelectronics are outlined herein. Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantation and daily&#8208;life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that&#160;simultaneously features shape&#8208;memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization&#8208;triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase&#8208;separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.








Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape&#8208;memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase&#8208;separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape&#8208;memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

&lt;p&gt;To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape-memory poly(urea-urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross-links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization-triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase-separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long-standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape-memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ru&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Spin Frustration and Enhancement of the Room&#8208;Temperature Anomalous Hall Effect in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;doping&#8208;enhanced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 epitaxial films is explored, which circumvents the long&#8208;standing dilemma between large AHE and high Tc in transition&#8208;metal oxides. It is found that Ru doping can modulate the local exchange coupling and thus cause considerable spin frustration. The resultant spin frustration can dramatically enhance the skew&#8208;scattering and the extrinsic AHE.








Abstract
In transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma of mutually strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions. Here, Ru&#8208;doping&#8208;enhanced AHE in La2/3Sr1/3Mn1&#8722;xRuxO3 epitaxial films is exploited. As the B&#8208;site Ru doping level increases up to 20%, the anomalous Hall resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from n&#937; cm to &#181;&#937;&#160;cm scale. Ru doping leads to strong competition between the ferromagnetic double&#8208;exchange interaction and the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction. The resultant spin frustration and spin&#8208;glass state facilitate a strong skew&#8208;scattering process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. The findings can pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of oxide&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Novel (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters in defective carbon supports derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch. The (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The mass activity is far superior to commercial 20% Pt/C.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

         <title>An Activity&#8208;Based Photosensitizer to Reverse Hypoxia and Oxidative&#160;Resistance for Tumor Photodynamic Eradication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity&#8208;based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

         <title>Boosting Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Activity via Atom&#8208;Stepped Interfaces Architected with Kinetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy yet stable interface architecture with abundant catalytically active atom steps can be facilely fabricated by utilizing the kinetic frustration effect in glass&#8208;forming alloys during rapid solidification. These atomic steps can be well stabilized due to the confinement effect imposed by the disordered glassy matrix and provide fast&#8208;catalytic kinetics for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction.








Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&#63743;Ni&#63743;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micropollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular engineering of amorphous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) successfully generates hydrophilic porous materials, which exhibit an exceptional removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% of phenol derivatives) and excellent recyclability. The photothermal characteristics of oxidized CTFs show a high volatile organic compound (VOC) rejection rate (&#8776;98% of phenol). Synergistic interplay of high&#8208;performance adsorption and solar&#8208;driven evaporation enables complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of mixture of phenol derivatives.








Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires an energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% in 10&#160;s) and can be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to mitigate the mismatch between mechanical reliability and energy density for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrode&#8208;based LIBs enable a remarkable figure of merit (FOM) value of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3, proving the brilliant comprehensive performance of flexible high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.








Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, difficult to achieve excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously via the current approaches for designing flexible LIBs. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8776;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;70&#160;&#181;m) and graphite anodes (&#8776;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;105&#160;&#181;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400 and 600&#160;&#181;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of the up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8776;600&#160;&#181;m) successfully realizes a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density vs bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing the mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; synthetic approach is devised for covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich organic nanomaterials (i.e., carbon dots) onto commercially available 2D allyl germanane via the thiol&#8211;ene click reaction. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.








Abstract
Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin&#8208;center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.








Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature,which can be practically applied, remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer is demonstrated, which is composed of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote the spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long&#8208;sought&#8208;after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.

A quaternary strategy is used to achieve desirable carrier behaviors and optimized multiphase morphology; thus, the device shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the device with &#8776;300&#160;nm&#8208;thick film shows a high efficiency of 17.55%, and the large&#8208;area devices (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) deliver encouraging PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, which are among the highest values reported so far.








Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm&#8208;thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm&#8208;thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;hijacking Nanoparticles Spatiotemporally Directing Endogenous Ferroptosis for Synergistic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Existing ferroptosis as an iron&#8208;dependent form of regulated cell death primarily relies on importing exogenous iron. However, the excessive employment of toxic materials may cause potential adverse effects on human health. Herein, we fabricated a ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) for endogenous ferroptosis without introducing Fenton&#8208;reactive metals. Once internalized, the designed Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15 NPs could specifically accumulate around ferritin. With laser irradiation, the activated Ce6 in nanoparticles potently generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) surrounding ferritin. Abundant ROS not only help to destroy the iron storage protein and activate endogenous ferroptosis but also directly kill tumor cells. In turn, the released iron partially interacted with intracellular excess H2O2 to produce O2, thereby enhancing photodynamic therapy (PDT) and further amplifying oxidative stress. Overall, this work highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8208;photodynamic antitumor therapy.

         <title>Scalable Ultrathin All&#8208;Organic Polymer Dielectric Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The miniaturization of electronic devices and power systems for capacitive energy storage under harsh environments including elevated temperatures requires scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin high&#8208;temperature dielectric films. To the end, ultrasonic spraying coating (USC) can be used to fabricate high&#8208;quality ultrathin films. Novel commercial polyimides with a dipolar group &#8208;CF3 (F&#8208;PI) and all&#8208;organic composites with trace organic semiconductor can serve as models. These scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin dielectric films (&#8764;2.6&#160;&#956;m and &#8764;5.2&#160;&#956;m) were successfully fabricated via USC. The high quality of the films was evaluated from the micromillimeter scale to the submillimeter and above. The high Tg (&#8764;340&#176;C) and concurrent large bandgap Eg (&#8764;3.53&#160;eV) induced by weak conjugating from considerable interchain distance (&#8764;6.2 &#197;) enables F&#8208;PI to be an excellent matrix delivering a discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency U&#951;90 of up to 2.85 J/cm3 at 200&#176;C. This is 11.4 times higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial dielectric polymers. Further, the incorporation of trace organic semiconductor leads to a record U&#951;90 of &#8764;4.39 J/cm3 at 200&#176;C due to the markedly enhanced breakdown strength caused by deep charge traps at an energy of &#8764;2&#160;eV. Also, a USC&#8208;fabricated multilayer F&#8208;PI foil capacitor with &#8764;85&#160;nF (six layers) had good performance at elevated temperature (150&#176;C). These results confirm that USC is an excellent technology to fabricate high&#8208;quality ultrathin dielectric films and capacitors with huge potential in industrial applications.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimic redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. We herein report a tumor cell membrane&#8208;coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) for combinational second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor cell derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell membrane camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8211;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#160;m Al(OTF)3&#160;+ 1&#160;m HOTF + 1&#160;m Zn(OTF)2 mixed electrolyte is designed in Al/Zn&#8211;MnO batteries. During charging&#8208;discharging, a topological transformation of MnO at the cathode avoids the collapse of the structure, the Al&#8211;Zn regional alloy at the anode avoids the corrosion of metal aluminum, and the intercalation of Zn ions makes it exhibit good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aluminum is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energystorage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film results in the difficult development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8211;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn2+ is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs).

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Zn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be intercalated into the Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantification of the electromechanical measurements by piezoresponse force microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is a&#160;powerful non&#8208;destructive technique that has become one of the most widely used methods for characterization and exploration of the nanoscale properties in electromechanically active materials, primarily ferroelectrics. However, quantification of the PFM signal has been challenging due to the convolution of various extrinsic and intrinsic contributions with the genuine piezoelectric response of the sample. Although the quantification of the PFM amplitude signal has received considerable attention, the quantification of the PFM phase signal has not received much attention so far. A properly calibrated PFM phase signal can provide valuable information on the sign of the local piezoelectric coefficient &#8211; an important and non&#8208;trivial issue for emerging ferroelectric materials. In this work, we discuss two complementary methodologies to calibrate the PFM phase signal. The first approach is based on using a standard reference sample with well&#8208;known independently measured piezoelectric coefficients, while the second approach detects the electrostatic interactions between a sample and a cantilever to determine the parasitic phase offset. Application of these methodologies to the studies of the piezoelectric behavior in ferroelectric HfO2&#8208;based thin film capacitors revealed intriguing variations in the sign of the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d33,eff. It has been shown that the piezoelectric properties of the HfO2&#8208;based capacitors are inherently sensitive to their thickness, electrodes as well as deposition methods and can exhibit wide variations including a d33,eff sign change within a single device.

         <title>Activating Organic Phosphorescence via Heavy Metal&#8208;&#960;&#8208;interaction Induced Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing clusters, nanocrystals, and other semiconductors can sensitize the triplet states of their surface&#8208;bonded chromophores, but the energy loss such as nonradiative deactivation often prevents the synergistic light emission in their solid&#8208;state co&#8208;assemblies. Cocrystallization allows new combinations of molecules with complementary properties for achieving functionalities not available in single components. Here we report on the cocrystal formation that employs platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) as a triplet sensitizer and electron&#8208;deficient 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene&#160;diimides (NDIs) as organic phosphors. The hybrid cocrystals exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the low&#8208;lying, long&#8208;lived triplet state of NDIs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) exceeding 25% and a phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;Ph) of 156 &#956;s. This remarkable PL property benefits from the non&#8208;covalent electronic and spin&#8208;orbital coupling between the constituents.

         <title>Bioinspired Retinomorphic Device for Spontaneous Chromatic Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chromatic adaptation refers to the sensing and preprocessing of the spectral composition of incident light on the retina, and it is important for color image recognition. It is challenging to apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images via the same physical process using the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology because of redundant data detection, complicated signal conversion processes, and requirement for additional memory modules. Inspired by the highly efficient chromatic adaptation of the human retina, we present a two&#8208;dimensional O2&#8208;mediated platinum diselenide (PtSe2) device to simultaneously apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images. The device exhibits a wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoresponse and the linear pulse&#8208;number dependence of photoconductivity, which is dominated by the photon&#8208;mediated physical adsorption and desorption of O2 molecules on bilayer PtSe2. The proposed retinomorphic device shows superior image classification accuracy (over 90%) compared to an independent pseudocolor channel (less than 75%). Hence, it is promising for developing artificial vision perception systems with reduced architectural complexity.

         <title>Wide Bandgap Halide Perovskites&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Powered Blue Photodetector with 84.9% of External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report a self&#8208;powered, color filter&#8208;free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A&#8208;site monovalent cations of wide bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs+ ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increased charge carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280 A W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215;&#8197;1012 Jones under blue light. Furthermore, Cs+ improves durability under repetitive operations and ambient atmosphere. The proposed device exhibits peak responsivity of 0.307 A W&#8722;1, which is higher than that of the commercial InGaN&#8208;based blue PD (0.289 A W&#8722;1). This study will promote the development of next&#8208;generation image sensors with vertically stacked perovskite PDs.

         <title>Construction of Active Protein Materials: Manipulation on Morphology of Salmon Calcitonin Assemblies with Enhanced Bone Regeneration Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to improve the relatively low stability and fast degradation of protein drugs is proposed. &#8220;Active protein materials&#8221; can be constructed by regulating the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug itself via a small&#8208;molecular regulator, that is, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial.








Abstract
The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property; thus, various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. Here, an alternative way is proposed to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small&#8208;molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) and disulfide bond formation, the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug can be regulated, forming an &#8220;active protein material&#8221; itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of the easy preparation, high efficiency, and low cost of the active protein material with a bright future in biomedical applications.

         <title>Recent Progress of Metal Sulfide Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging unique properties of metal sulfide photocatalysts, including abundant active sites, light&#8208;harvesting ability, and expedited charge separation, endow them promising candidates for solar light conversion. This review aims to offer a full&#8208;scale lens to discuss the recent advances of metal sulfides photocatalysts, propose their challenges, and envision the prospects of the development of metal sulfides for photocatalytic redox reactions.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Here, it is described how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides are highlighted and future development trends in photocatalysis are envisioned.

         <title>Optical Signal Modulation in Photonic Waveguiding Heteroarchitectures with Continuously Variable Visible&#8208;To&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An input&#8208;to&#8208;output photonic logic gate is fabricated based on supramolecular heterostructures by phosphorescent Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu organometallic complexes. It is based on the optical waveguiding effect and efficient energy transfer among different blocks. The photonic logic gates show high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.








Abstract
Photonic circuit systems based on optical waveguiding heteroarchitectures have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential to overcome the speed limitation in electronic circuits by modulating the optical signal at the micro&#8208; or nanoscale. However, controlling the parameters, including the wavelength and polarization of the light outcoupling, as well as the sequence among different building blocks, remains a key issue. Herein, supramolecular heteroarchitectures made by phosphorescent organometallic complexes of Pt, Pd, Cu, and Au are applied as photonic logic gates that show continuously variable emission colors from 475 to 810&#160;nm, low waveguide losses down to 0.0077&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, and remarkable excitation&#8208;light polarization&#8208;dependent photoluminescence with anisotropy ratios up to 0.68. The sequences among Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu building blocks in the heteroarchitectures are controlled by living supramolecular polymerization or crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly synthetic approaches. The results indicate the prospects for using organometallic complexes and supramolecular synthetic approaches to prepare photonic circuit systems with tunable emission color and controllable sequences among different blocks that achieve modulation of the optical signal in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;Engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication is a new technology for the rapid biofabrication of highly aligned tissue&#8208;engineered constructs, like muscle and tendon. The filamentation of a light beam into a cell&#8208;laden photoresin results in a material composed of micrometer&#8208;scale hydrogel filaments acting as cell guiding cues. Cell migration into ultrahigh aspect ratio (&gt;700:1) voids induces alignment of cells and deposition of extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D&#160;topographical guidance for cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called filamented light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells. Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam is divided optically into FLight beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2 to 30&#160;&#181;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, nuclear deformation, and extracellular matrix deposition. FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt;10 s per construct). Multidirectional microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection, and complex multimaterial/multicellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photo&#8208;crosslinkable biomaterials.

         <title>A Monolithic Graphene Functionalized Microlaser for Multispecies Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Optical microcavity&#8208;enhanced light&#8208;matter interaction offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques, spurring applications in the detection of biochemical targets ranging from cells, nanoparticles and large molecules. However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, we realize a functionalized microlaser sensor by depositing graphene in an erbium doped over&#8208;modal microsphere. By using a 980&#160;nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co&#8208;generated in one single device. The interference between these splitting mode lasers produce beat notes in the electrical domain (0.2&#8764;1.1&#160;MHz) with sub kHz accuracy, thanks to the graphene&#8208;induced intracavity backward scattering. This allows for lab&#8208;free multispecies gas identification from a mixture, and ultrasensitive gas detection down to individual molecule.

         <title>Tolerogenic nanovaccine for prevention and treatment of autoimmune encephalomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We herein developed a tolerogenic nanovaccine and tested it an animal model of multiple sclerosis. The nanovaccine was constructed to deliver the self&#8208;antigen, MOG peptide, and dexamethasone on an abatacept&#8208;modified polydopamine core nanoparticle (AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG). AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG could target dendritic cells and undergo endocytosis followed by trafficking to lysosomes. AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG blocked the interaction between CD80/CD86 and CD28 in antigen&#8208;presenting cells and T cells, leading to decreased interferon gamma secretion. The subcutaneous administration of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG to mice yielded significant biodistribution to lymph nodes and, in experimental&#8208;autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model mice, increased the integrity of the myelin basic sheath and minimized the infiltration of immune cells. EAE mice were treated with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before or after injection of the autoantigen, MOG. Pre&#8208;immunization of AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG before the injection of MOG completely blocked the development of clinical symptoms. Early treatment with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG at 3 days after injection of MOG also completely blocked the induction of symptoms. Notably, treatment of EAE symptom&#8208;developed mice with AbaLDPN&#8208;MOG significantly alleviated the symptoms, indicating that the nanovaccine had therapeutic effects. Although we used AbaLDPN for MOG peptide delivery in the EAE model, the concept of AbaLDPN can be widely applied for the prevention and alleviation of other autoimmune diseases.

         <title>The Use of Exchange Coupled Atom Qubits as Atomic&#8208;Scale Magnetic Field Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phosphorus atoms in silicon offer a rich quantum computing platform where both nuclear and electron spins can be used to store and process quantum information. While individual control of electron and nuclear spins has been demonstrated, the interplay between them during qubit operations has been largely unexplored. This study investigates the use of exchange&#8208;based operation between donor bound electron spins to probe the local magnetic fields experienced by the qubits with exquisite precision at the atomic scale. To achieve this, coherent exchange oscillations are performed between two electron spin qubits, where the left and right qubits are hosted by three and two phosphorus donors, respectively. The frequency spectrum of exchange oscillations shows quantised changes in the local magnetic fields at the qubit sites, corresponding to the different hyperfine coupling between the electron and each of the qubit&#8208;hosting nuclear spins. This ability to sense the hyperfine fields of individual nuclear spins using the exchange interaction constitutes a unique metrology technique, which reveals the exact crystallographic arrangements of the phosphorus atoms in the silicon crystal for each qubit. The detailed knowledge obtained of the local magnetic environment can then be used to engineer hyperfine fields in multi&#8208;donor qubits for high&#8208;fidelity two&#8208;qubit&#160;gates.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;assisted Cobalt&#8208;ditelluride Polyhedra Inducing Lattice Strain to Endow Efficient Adsorption&#8208;catalysis for High&#8208;energy Lithium&#8208;sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Developing a conductive catalyst with high catalytic activity is considered to be an effective strategy for improving cathode kinetics of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, especially at large current density and lean electrolytes. Lattice strain engineering has been a strategy to tune the local structure of catalysts and to help understand the structure&#8208;activity relationship between strain and catalyst performance. Here, Co0.9Zn0.1Te2@NC has been constructed after Zinc atoms uniformly doped into the CoTe2 lattice. The experimental/theoretical results indicate that change of the coordination environment for the Cobalt atom by the lattice strain modulates the d&#8208;band center with more electrons occupied in antibonding orbitals, thus balancing the adsorption of polysulfides and the intrinsic catalytic effect, thereby activating the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Benefiting from the merits, with only 4 wt% dosages of catalyst in the cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g&#8722;1 could be achieved at 1 C and stable cycling performances are achieved for 1500/2500 cycles at 1 C/2 C. Upon sulfur loading of 7.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the areal capacity can reach 12.8 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work provides a guiding methodology for the design of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies for the rational design of cathode in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Polymeric Single Ion Conductors with Enhanced Side Chains Motion for High&#8208;performance Solid Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zn&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have enormous potential in realizing high&#8208;performance and safe zinc ion batteries. Polymeric single ion conductor (PSIC)&#8208;based SPEs can largely eradicate anion migration and side reactions of electrodes with decreased polarization, but the ionic conductivity of common PSICs is still unsatisfactory due to the tight localized ion interactions and sluggish polymer chain motion. Herein, by employing the heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain, a novel PSIC was fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion, which was confirmed by the molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers an ionic conductivity up to 5.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number of 0.94. Based on the PSIC, dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping cycling (2000&#160;h) was achieved with low polarization potentials. A further assembled Zn&#8214;V2O5 battery exhibits superior performances to other solid ZIBs, including a high discharge capacity (196 mAh g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (64 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 6 C), and long cycling life (capacity retention 88.5% after 10000 cycles). In addition, a remarkable shelf&#8208;life (90 days), low self&#8208;discharge rate (capacity loss &#8764;0.18% per day), and good temperature adaptability of the solid battery can be achieved benefiting from the high stability of the SPE during operation. The PSIC&#8208;based SPEs with advanced ion transport structure endow solid ZIBs with significant performance improvement, high safety, and durability.

         <title>Transfer&#8208;Free Quasi&#8208;Suspended Graphene Grown on a Si Wafer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The direct growth of graphene affording wafer&#8208;scale uniformity on insulators is paramount to electronic and optoelectronic applications; however, it remains a challenge to date, because it entails an entirely different growth mode than that over metals. Herein, we demonstrate the metal&#8208;catalyst&#8208;free growth of quasi&#8208;suspended graphene on a Si wafer using an interface&#8208;decoupling chemical vapor deposition strategy. The employment of lower&#8208;than&#8208;conventional H2 dosage and concurrent introduction of methanol during growth can effectively weaken the interaction between the synthesized graphene and the underlying substrate. The growth mode can be thus fine&#8208;tuned, producing a predominantly monolayer graphene film with wafer&#8208;level homogeneity. Graphene thus grown on a 4&#8208;inch Si wafer enables the transfer&#8208;free fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor arrays that exhibit almost no shift in the charge neutral point, indicating a quasi&#8208;suspended feature of the graphene. Moreover, a carrier mobility up to 15000 cm2 V&#8210;1 s&#8210;1 can be attained. This study is anticipated to offer meaningful insights into the synthesis of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality graphene on dielectrics for practical graphene devices.

&lt;p&gt;The direct growth of graphene affording wafer-scale uniformity on insulators is paramount to electronic and optoelectronic applications; however, it remains a challenge to date, because it entails an entirely different growth mode than that over metals. Herein, we demonstrate the metal-catalyst-free growth of quasi-suspended graphene on a Si wafer using an interface-decoupling chemical vapor deposition strategy. The employment of lower-than-conventional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dosage and concurrent introduction of methanol during growth can effectively weaken the interaction between the synthesized graphene and the underlying substrate. The growth mode can be thus fine-tuned, producing a predominantly monolayer graphene film with wafer-level homogeneity. Graphene thus grown on a 4-inch Si wafer enables the transfer-free fabrication of high-performance graphene-based field-effect transistor arrays that exhibit almost no shift in the charge neutral point, indicating a quasi-suspended feature of the graphene. Moreover, a carrier mobility up to 15000 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8210;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be attained.

Abstract
High maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE), small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and long operational lifetime at practical luminances are three crucial parameters for commercialization of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To simultaneously achieve these goals, it is desirable to have the radiative decay rate constant (kr) as large as possible, which, for a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitter, requires both a large S1&#8594;S0 radiative decay rate constant (krS) and a small singlet&#8208;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Here, we report the design of a class of tetradentate gold(III) TADF complexes for narrowing the &#916;EST while keeping the krS large. The as&#8208;synthesized complexes display green emission with close to unity emission quantum yields and kr approaching 2&#160;&#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films. The vacuum&#8208;deposited green OLEDs based on 1 and 4 demonstrate maximum EQEs of up to 24 and 27% with efficiency roll&#8208;offs of 5.5 and 2.2% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively; the EQEs maintain high at 10,000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 (19% (1) and 24% (4)). A long LT90 device lifetime of 1820&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for complex 1 has been achieved, which is one of the longest device lifetimes of TADF&#8208;OLEDs reported in the literature.

         <title>Activating C&#8722;H Bond by Tuning Fe Site and Interfacial Effect for Enhanced Methanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The interaction mechanism between the reacting species and the active site of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;based photoanodes in photoelectrochemical methanol conversion reaction is still ambiguous. Herein, we demonstrate a simple two&#8208;step strategy to fabricate a porous &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 heterojunction for the methanol conversion reaction. The influence of the electronic structure of active site and interfacial effect on the reaction have been investigated by constructing two different FeO6 octahedral configurations and heterogeneous structures. The optimal sample ZnFeCo&#8208;2 affords high photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl, which is 3.2 times than that of pure ZnFe (0.37 mA cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the ZnFeCo&#8208;2 also exhibits 97.8% Faraday efficiency of CH3OH to HCHO, and long&#8208;term stability over 40 h. Furthermore, Density functional theory calculations reveal that the heterostructured &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 with favorable electron transfer effectively lowers methanol adsorption, C&#8722;H bond activation and HCHO desorption energy relative to the pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, resulting in the excellent methanol conversion efficiency.

         <title>Coexistence of Urbach&#8208;Tail&#8208;Like Localized States and Metallic Conduction Channels in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Curved Graphene</title>

Abstract
Nitrogen (N) doping is one of the most effective approaches to tailor the chemical and physical properties of graphene. By the interplay between N dopants and three&#8208;dimensional curvature of graphene lattices, N&#8208;doped 3D graphene displays superior performances in electrocatalysis and solar energy harvesting for energy and environmental applications. However, the electrical transport properties and the electronic states, which are the key factors to understand the origins of the N doping effect in 3D graphene, are still missing. We systematically investigated the electronic properties of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene by an electric double&#8208;layer transistor method. We demonstrated that Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized states occupy around the neutral point of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene with the background metallic transport channels. The dual nature of electronic states, generated by the synergistic effect of N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene, could be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.

         <title>Polarization Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization domains in uniaxial ferroelectrics acquire a remarkable topological configuration of branching and crisscrossing domains. The domains are separated by the united domain wall spreading all over the sample and containing saddle&#8208;like singular nodes.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarization discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent 2D conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons, or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hallmark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarization meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

         <title>Immune Profiling and Multiplexed Label&#8208;Free Detection of 2D MXenes by Mass Cytometry and High&#8208;Dimensional Imaging</title>

&#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) is a multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy enabling nanomaterial tracking and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. MXenes are designed to be detected within the mass cytometry range. Their detection and quantification are demonstrated in 15 human immune cell subpopulations and in different organs.








Abstract
There is a critical unmet need to detect and image 2D&#160;materials within single cells and tissues while surveying a high degree of information from single cells. Here, a versatile multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy is proposed based on single&#8208;cell mass cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) and ion&#8208;beam imaging by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MIBI&#8208;TOF). This strategy, &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED), enables nanomaterial detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. As a proof of concept, a set of 2D materials, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes), is selected to ensure mass detection within the cytometry range while avoiding overlap with more than 70 currently available tags, each able to survey multiple biological parameters. First, their detection and quantification in 15 primary human immune cell subpopulations are demonstrated. Together with the detection, mass cytometry is used to capture several biological aspects of MXenes, such as their biocompatibility and cytokine production after their uptake. Through enzymatic labeling, MXenes&#8217; mediation of cell&#8211;cell interactions is simultaneously evaluated. In vivo biodistribution experiments using a mixture of MXenes in mice confirm the versatility of the detection strategy and reveal MXene accumulation in the liver, blood, spleen, lungs, and relative immune cell subtypes. Finally, MIBI&#8208;TOF is applied to detect MXenes in different organs revealing their spatial distribution. The label&#8208;free detection of 2D materials by mass cytometry at the single&#8208;cell level, on multiple cell subpopulations and in multiple organs simultaneously, will enable exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive memristors with highly uniform and widely tunable relaxation time are demonstrated. The dynamic relaxation behavior of such diffusive memristors is used as exponential decay kernels to implement the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm for high&#8208;accuracy event&#8208;based pattern recognition.








Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device relaxation dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, the device stack is engineered to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963; reduced from &#8776;12 to &#8776;0.32&#160;ms). The memristor is further connected with a resistor or a capacitor and the relaxation time is tuned between 1.13 &#181;s and 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. The hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation, is implemented. An accuracy of 77.3% is achieved in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. The work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

     alt="Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event-Based Pattern Recognition"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diffusive memristors with highly uniform and widely tunable relaxation time are demonstrated. The dynamic relaxation behavior of such diffusive memristors is used as exponential decay kernels to implement the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm for high-accuracy event-based pattern recognition.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain-inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device relaxation dynamics limits the wide-range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, the device stack is engineered to achieve a much-improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963; reduced from &#8776;12 to &#8776;0.32&#160;ms). The memristor is further connected with a resistor or a capacitor and the relaxation time is tuned between 1.13 &#181;s and 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. The hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation, is implemented. An accuracy of 77.3% is achieved in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N-MNIST) dataset. The work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulating Hydrogen Adsorption via Charge Transfer at Semiconductor&#8208;Metal Heterointerface for Highly Efficient Hydrogen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Designing and synthesizing highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is important for realizing hydrogen economy. Tuning the electronic structure of the electrocatalysts is essential to achieve optimal HER activity, and interfacial engineering is an effective strategy to induce electron transfer in a heterostructure interface to optimize HER kinetics. In this study, we synthesized ultrafine RhP2/Rh nanoparticles with a well&#8208;defined semiconductor&#8208;metal heterointerface embedded in N,P co&#8208;doped graphene (RhP2/Rh@NPG) via a one&#8208;step pyrolysis. RhP2/Rh@NPG exhibited outstanding HER performances under all pH conditions. Electrochemical characterization and first principles density functional theory calculations revealed that the RhP2/Rh heterointerface induced electron transfer from metallic Rh to semiconductive RhP2, which increased the electron density on the Rh atoms in RhP2 and weakened the hydrogen adsorption on RhP2, thereby accelerating HER kinetics. Moreover, the interfacial electron transfer activated the dual&#8208;site synergistic effect of Rh and P of RhP2 in neutral and alkaline environments, thereby promoting reorganization of interfacial water molecules for faster HER kinetics.

         <title>From Heterostructures to Solid&#8208;Solutions: Structural Tunability in Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The stability, reliability, and performance of halide perovskite&#8208;based devices depend upon the structure, composition, and particle size of the device&#8208;enabling materials. Indeed, the degree of ion mixing in multicomponent perovskite crystals, although challenging to control, is a key factor in determining properties. Herein, an emerging method termed evaporation&#8208;crystallization polymer pen lithography (EC&#8208;PPL) is used to synthesize and systematically study the degree of ionic mixing of Cs0.5FA0.5PbX3 (FA = formamidinium; X = halide anion, ABX3) crystals, as a function of size, temperature, and composition. These experiments have led to the discovery of a heterostructure morphology where the A&#8208;site cations, Cs and FA, are segregated into the core and edge layers, respectively. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the heterostructures form as a consequence of a combination of both differences in solubility of the two ions in solution and the enthalpic preference for Cs&#8208;FA ion segregation. This preference for segregation can be overcome to form a solid&#8208;solution by decreasing crystal size (&lt; 60&#160;nm) or increasing temperature. Finally, we utilized these tools to identify and synthesize solid&#8208;solution nanocrystals of Cs0.5FA0.5Pb(Br/I)3 that significantly suppress photo&#8208;induced anion migration compared to their bulk counterparts, offering a route to deliberately designed photostable optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Sub&#8208;Freezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;free electrolytes, based on methyl acetate and fluorinated ethers, is proposed for Li&#8208;ion batteries operating at sub&#8208;freezing temperatures. The EC&#8208;free electrolyte demonstrates all&#8208;round performance advantages over the traditional EC&#8208;based electrolyte and presents a viable solution to improve the capacity retention and rechargeability of metal&#8208;ion batteries in cold climates.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;freezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#160;&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#160;&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here, a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibits remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan is reported. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create a highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO)|Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

Formation of 2D modular intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n nanostructures with periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the bulk SnSe matrix significantly scatters the phonons and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity&#160; drastically to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Thereby, a record high thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.0 at &#8776;800 K is achieved in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe.








Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92&#160;+ x mol% MoCl5 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 798 K in SnSe0.92&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl5. The 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby blocking the heat carrying phonons, which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

Abstract
Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

         <title>Tropocollagen&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for 3D High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.








Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8722;10&#8201;m2&#8201;K&#8201;W&#8722;1 in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally-responsive shape-memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase-change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape-programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight, and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are built on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW &#956;m&#8722;1. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behavior achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based controllable PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb remarkedly increase the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

&lt;p&gt;The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2-polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re-education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria-derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV-based controllable two-way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV-CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV-CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV-CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation-triggered controlled release of OMV-CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two-way adaptors, OMV-CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell-mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current&#8208;driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.








Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

         <title>A Simple Preheating&#8208;Pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon Black</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple pyrolysis strategy by mixing FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, and carbon black can impart high oxygen reduction reaction activities and stabilities to commercial carbon black; the catalyst obtained by this simple method has a stronger catalytic activity than metal&#8211;organic frameworks derived carbon, metal&#8208;loaded graphene, and single&#8208;atom sites catalysts. This approach can also be extended to other nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands.








Abstract
Maintaining the high catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs is a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Here, the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black is enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. Preheating is proposed as a process improvement method using a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieves an effective combination of phen and carbon black, and enhances the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increases the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and no obvious decay after 20&#160;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;m&#160;KOH, which are all among the best&#8208;reported data known to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions is also investigated. Under the right conditions, cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon suboxide is a molecule spontaneously polymerizing into conjugated ladder oligomers composed of carbon and oxygen atoms only, and named &#8220;red carbon.&#8221; Herein, this partially forgotten chemistry is brought back to the attention of the community of covalent semiconductors. As&#8208;synthesized red carbon generates superoxide species upon light irradiation, acting as an efficient photocatalyst, with performance superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon nitrides.








Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0&#160;&#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, the aim is to bring &#8220;red carbon,&#8221; a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows one to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8211;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and can be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic&#8208;scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases of Cu2Se in one grain.








Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transitions is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

     alt="Atomic-Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic-scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high- and low-temperature phases of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se in one grain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second-order phase transitions is well-established, their atomic-scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second-order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic-scale understanding of second-order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoO nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive for Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The highly dispersed CoO NDs integrate both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst, which can make a contribution to promoting the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, achieving a superior cyclability.








Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulting from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytis of CoO NDs, Li2O2 is produced and deposits on the cathode together with them. At the recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;Based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ.

&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/[2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production-line compatible bottom silicon wafers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high-performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production-line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular-level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/2PACz ([2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high-quality perovskite layer on top. The NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer facilitates a uniform self-assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top-cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production-line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8211;Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single&#8208;Cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic diagram of single&#8208;cluster nanowires constructed by Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) coassembly is presented. Ag clusters are generated by visible light induced reduction, which are then connected with POM clusters to form 1D superstructures with alternative arrangement. Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization, due to the promoted electron transfer in nanowire heterojunctions.








Abstract
1D superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8211;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based heteroconstructions.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite thin films with a 2D&#8211;3D gradient result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increase the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lower the dark current density to a record&#8208;value of 10&#8211;9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in maximized sensitivity.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tunable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, it is shown that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&amp;lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Super&#8208;Linear&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Switching Selector with Multiple Jar&#8208;Shaped Cu&#8208;Filaments in the Amorphous Ge3Se7 Resistive Switching Layer in a Cross&#8208;Point Synaptic Memristor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

Phototransistors
In article number 2205679, Peiguang Yan, Zhenhua Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with benign light&#8208;irradiance adaptability using a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. The dynamic trapping and detrapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.

Skyrmion Motion
Understanding skyrmion motion is essential for the efficient operation of skyrmionic devices. In article number 2203275, Chanyong Hwang, Kyoung&#8208;Whan Kim, Albert Min Gyu Park, Kab&#8208;Jin Kim, and co&#8208;workers uncover a universal scaling behavior in the current&#8208;driven motion of skyrmions. The topology of the shape of the interface drags the skyrmions and causes them to show hopping properties distinct from the creep motion expected for magnetic domains. The universal scaling can provide insights for implementing skyrmion devices and understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface.

Bioreactors
In article number 2109973, Liping Zhong, Kun Zhang, Yongxiang Zhao, and co&#8208;workers describe how a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) unlocks antitumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than GO, allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with vitamin&#8208;C&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.

         <title>Necklace&#8208;Like Nanostructures: From Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their intriguing and specific appearance and architecture, necklace&#8208;like nanostructures carry some unique features over simple 1D nanogeometries. In this review, necklace&#8208;like structures by focusing on their diverse synthetic strategies, distinctive properties, and applications, as well as future directions for fabricating and capitalizing on necklace&#8208;like structures are summarized.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of 1D structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nanostructures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying the molecular rotary motion of photoresponsive overcrowded alkene molecular motor (OAMM) by liquid crystal provides great opportunities in design and fabrication of advanced materials and functional systems. This review summarizes the recent progress of the OAMM triggered light&#8208;directed systems and the challenges and outlooks in the development of OAMM&#8208;liquid crystal composite system are concluded.








Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>

Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decay electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here we have devised an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying energy level offset between channel material and electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g. imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. Our novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives towards the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency and endurance.

By varying energy level offset between channel material and electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g. imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. Our novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives towards the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Shining Transparent Display with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>

Abstract
Transparent display (TD) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen has appeared as an emerging technology towards augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, we explore the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter, and sandwich it in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity and good reliability, and our TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8764;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and micro&#8208;structural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;c, ca. 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;cfs, ca. 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (S, ca. 3; &#295;&#969;, ca. 285 cm&#8722;1), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (Ea, ca. 0.43&#160;eV) for NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ emission and layered architecture for screen film. These findings establish the fundamental guidelines for narrow&#8208;band emitting materials design and shine light on superior TD innovative development.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;Salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature molten salt dimethylamine acetate is developed as the solvent for precursor solutions, which also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film. Consequently, 1.25 V of the open&#8208;circuit voltage and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells reported so far.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc) is demonstrated, which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions, but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I,Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest reported thus far. This intermediate phase&#8208;regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, we present a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the LUMO energy, resulting in red&#8208;shifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, we find that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products are heavily pursued because of their commercial values, whose efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. Flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, we report that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cell and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by our experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens the avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Flammable High&#8208;Voltage 4.7 V Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries employ in&#8208;situ lithium plated current collectors as negative electrodes to afford optimal mass and volumetric energy densities. The main challenges to such batteries include their poor cycling stability and safety issues of flammable organic electrolytes. Here, we report a high&#8208;voltage 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery using a Cu foil coated with a layer (&#8764; 950&#160;nm) of silicon&#8208;polyacrylonitrile (Si&#8208;PAN, 25.5&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2) as the negative electrode, a high&#8208;voltage cobalt&#8208;free LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) as the positive electrode and a safe, non&#8208;flammable ionic liquid electrolyte comprised of 4.5&#160;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in N&#8208;methyl&#8208;N&#8208;propyl pyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Py13FSI) with 1 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as additive. The Si&#8208;PAN coating was found to seed the growth of lithium during charging, and reversibly expand/shrink during lithium plating/stripping over battery cycling. The wide voltage&#8208;window electrolyte containing a high concentration of FSI&#8722; and TFSI&#8722; facilitated the formation of stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, affording a 4.7&#160;V anode&#8208;free Cu@Si&#8208;PAN/LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 battery with a reversible specific capacity of &#8764; 120 mAh g&#8722;1 and high cycling stability (80% capacity retention after 120 cycles). These results represent the first anode&#8208;free Li battery with a high 4.7&#160;V discharge voltage and high safety.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anode-free lithium metal batteries employ in-situ lithium plated current collectors as negative electrodes to afford optimal mass and volumetric energy densities. The main challenges to such batteries include their poor cycling stability and safety issues of flammable organic electrolytes. Here, we report a high-voltage 4.7&#160;V anode-free lithium metal battery using a Cu foil coated with a layer (&#8764; 950&#160;nm) of silicon-polyacrylonitrile (Si-PAN, 25.5&#160;&#956;g cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) as the negative electrode, a high-voltage cobalt-free LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LNMO) as the positive electrode and a safe, non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte comprised of 4.5&#160;M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt in N-methyl-N-propyl pyrrolidiniumbis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (Py&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;FSI) with 1 wt% lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) as additive.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>Nanopatterning Technologies of 2D Materials for Integrated Electronic and Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanopatterning bridges the microstructure of 2D materials and integrated chip devices, essentially enabling and prompting their successful application in industry. A critical summary on the recent development of key nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials, with the aim of realizing large&#8208;scale device integration, is provided. This contribution offers a pioneering reference and guidelines to promote 2D materials from laboratory research to practical use.








Abstract
With the reduction of feature size and increase of integration density, traditional 3D semiconductors are unable to meet the future requirements of chip integration. The current semiconductor fabrication technologies are approaching their physical limits based on Moore's law. 2D materials such as graphene, transitional metal dichalcogenides, etc., are of great promise for future memory, logic, and photonic devices due to their unique and excellent properties. To prompt 2D materials and devices from the laboratory research stage to the industrial integrated circuit&#8208;level, it is necessary to develop advanced nanopatterning methods to obtain high&#8208;quality, wafer&#8208;scale, and patterned 2D products. Herein, the recent development of nanopatterning technologies, particularly toward realizing large&#8208;scale practical application of 2D materials is reviewed. Based on the technological progress, the unique requirement and advances of the 2D integration process for logic, memory, and optoelectronic devices are further summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of nanopatterning technologies of 2D materials for future integrated chip devices are prospected.

         <title>Beyond Human Touch Perception: An Adaptive Robotic Skin Based on Gallium Microgranules for Pressure Sensory Augmentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An adaptive robotic skin with augmented pressure sensing ability is introduced. Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Abstract
Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>An Integrated 3D Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF2&#63743; segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating&#8208;lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium&#8208;metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. Based on the&#160;large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoro segment (&#63743;CF2&#63743; further endows HFE with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium&#8208;metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the role of weakening solvating power of outer&#8208;shell solvents to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium-metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE.

The HFE-EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium-metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high-areal-loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.








Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

&lt;p&gt;A solar thermoelectric generator is fabricated with outstanding temperature difference and the property of synergistic utilization of solar energy and waste heat by in situ redox reaction to construct n-type, p-type, and photothermal sides in one nanowire film that is the reverse side of passive radiative cooling film. The ordered nanowire film also imparts the solar thermoelectric generator with better thermoelectrical performance.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>A Optically Controlled Virtual Microsensor for Biomarker Detection In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new technique for biomarker detection in vivo, named as &#8220;optically controlled virtual microsensor&#8221; (OCViM), is developed by employing a specially shaped laser beam as a virtual handle and a fluorescent nanoprobe as the sensor tip. With the advantages of noninvasiveness, active control, and high resolution, OCViM demonstrates great potential for studying thrombosis in living zebrafish.








Abstract
Current technologies for the real&#8208;time analysis of biomarkers in vivo, such as needle&#8208;type microelectrodes and molecular imaging methods based on exogenous contrast agents, are still facing great challenges in either invasive detection or lack of active control of the imaging probes. In this study, by combining the design concepts of needle&#8208;type microelectrodes and the fluorescence imaging method, a new technique is developed for detecting biomarkers in vivo, named as &#8220;optically controlled virtual microsensor&#8221; (OCViM). OCViM is established by the organic integration of a specially shaped laser beam and fluorescent nanoprobe, which serve as the virtual handle and sensor tip, respectively. The laser beam can trap and manipulate the nanoprobe in a programmable manner, and meanwhile excite it to generate fluorescence emission for biosensing. On this basis, fully active control of the nanoprobe is achieved noninvasively in vivo, and multipoint detection can be realized at sub&#8208;micrometer resolution by shifting a nanoprobe among multiple positions. By using OCViM, the overexpression and heterogenous distribution of biomarkers in the thrombus is studied in living zebrafish, which is further utilized for the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs. OCViM may provide a powerful tool for the mechanism study of thrombus progression and the evaluation of antithrombotic drugs.

         <dc:description>
Industry&#8211;academia cooperative activities have decreased in South Korea, despite the government's expansion of R&amp;D investment, presenting challenges as cutting&#8208;edge technologies develop rapidly. A new policy of &#8220;3N&#8221;, National Lab, National Facility, and National Research Team in the field of materials, has been launched recently, to enhance the cooperative networks. More diversity in activating the open innovation ecosystem is needed.








Abstract
The current status and policy directions of Republic of Korea's industry&#8211;academia cooperation in materials research are introduced. Industry&#8211;academia cooperation has various forms, such as contract research, joint research, technology transfer, technology assistance, as well as talent development between universities and industry. The actual characteristics of industry&#8211;academia cooperation are differentiated, depending on research models such as curiosity&#8208;driven research, market&#8208;driven research, and scenario&#8208;driven research. In addition, there are diverse forms of cooperation, ranging from attaining one&#8208;off cooperation goals, to implementing a series of cooperation, to forging sustainable partnership through sharing of values. The efforts and tasks supporting industry&#8211;academia cooperation, and the diverse industry&#8211;academia cooperative activities, are considered herein from the perspective of the Korean government's policy. Policy recommendations for the industry&#8211;academia cooperation, based on the current state and tasks of materials field, are also suggested.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films.

Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

     alt="Morphology-Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unconventional nonlinear-carbon-supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene-based tunnel-junction structures and small-gapped quasi-monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.
