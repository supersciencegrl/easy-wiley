         <title>Multifaceted Design and Emerging Applications of Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformative advances are made in the field of tissue adhesives, fueled by the synergy between disciplines ranging from mechanics and chemistry to biology. A multifaceted design of tissue adhesives is presented with examples in emerging applications. Immediate opportunities and future directions are highlighted for next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives, which would make broad impact in engineering and medicine.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives can form appreciable adhesion with tissues and have found clinical use in a variety of medical settings such as wound closure, surgical sealants, regenerative medicine, and device attachment. The advantages of tissue adhesives include ease of implementation, rapid application, mitigation of tissue damage, and compatibility with minimally invasive procedures. The field of tissue adhesives is rapidly evolving, leading to tissue adhesives with superior mechanical properties and advanced functionality. Such adhesives enable new applications ranging from mobile health to cancer treatment. To provide guidelines for the rational design of tissue adhesives, here, existing strategies for tissue adhesives are synthesized into a multifaceted design, which comprises three design elements: the tissue, the adhesive surface, and the adhesive matrix. The mechanical, chemical, and biological considerations associated with each design element are reviewed. Throughout the report, the limitations of existing tissue adhesives and immediate opportunities for improvement are discussed. The recent progress of tissue adhesives in topical and implantable applications is highlighted, and then future directions toward next&#8208;generation tissue adhesives are outlined. The development of tissue adhesives will fuse disciplines and make broad impacts in engineering and medicine.

         <title>Underwater Communication and Optical Camouflage Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transparent, underwater adhesive, underwater self&#8208;healable, stretchable, and 3D&#8208;printable ionogel with high ionic conductivity is developed to create a submersible soft sensor. Optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication can be achieved by the ionogel sensor in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism, which can avoid fatigue and physical damage, is also proposed.








Abstract
Marine animals, such as leptocephalus and jellyfish, can sense external stimuli and achieve optical camouflage in the aquatic environment. Fabricating an intelligent soft sensor that can mimic the capabilities of transparent marine animals and function underwater can enable transformative applications in various novel fields. However, previously reported soft sensors struggle to meet the requirements of adhesion, self&#8208;healing ability, optical transparency, and stable conductivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, high&#8208;performance ionogels by virtue of ion&#8211;dipole and ion&#8211;ion interactions between fluorine&#8208;rich poly(ionic liquid) and ionic liquid are designed. The hydrophobic dynamic viscoelastic networks provide excellent properties for ionogels, including optical transparency, adjustable mechanical properties, underwater self&#8208;healing ability, underwater adhesiveness, conductivity, and 3D printability. A mechanically compliant and visually invisible underwater soft sensor based on ionogel is developed. This sensor can achieve optical camouflage, human&#8208;body&#8208;motion detection, and barrier&#8208;free communication in the aquatic environment. A novel contactless sensing mechanism based on changing the electron transfer pathway is proposed. Several interesting functions, such as detection of water environment changes, recognition of objects, delivery of information, and even identification of human standing posture can be realized. Importantly, the ionogel sensor can avoid fatigue and physical damage in the sensing process.

         <title>Characterization and Quantification of Depletion and Accumulation Layers in Solid&#8208;State Li+&#8208;Conducting Electrolytes Using In Situ Spectroscopic Ellipsometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes are one of the few battery technologies for next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the high interface resistance in contact with electrode materials is still largely unexplained. Spectroscopic ellipsometry combined with in situ electrochemistry reveals highly asymmetric space charge layer occurrence. It opens a new study field to investigate and quantify the charge layer formation in solid&#8208;state electrolytes by optical means.








Abstract
The future of mobility depends on the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies, such as all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. As the ionic conductivity of solid Li+&#8208;conductors can, in some cases, approach that of liquid electrolytes, a significant remaining barrier faced by solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) is the interface formed at the anode and cathode materials, with chemical instability and physical resistances arising. The physical properties of space charge layers (SCLs), a widely discussed phenomenon in SSEs, are still unclear. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to characterize the accumulation and depletion layers. An optical model is developed to quantify their thicknesses and corresponding concentration changes. It is shown that the Li+&#8208;depleted layer (&#8776;190&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) is thinner than the accumulation layer (&#8776;320&#160;nm at 1&#160;V) in a glassy lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting glass ceramic electrolyte (a trademark of Ohara Corporation). The in situ approach combining electrochemistry and optics resolves the ambiguities around SCL formation. It opens up a wide field of optical measurements on SSEs, allowing various experimental studies in the future.

         <title>Localized Delivery of Theranostic Nanoparticles and High&#8208;Energy Photons using Microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedle&#8208;based local delivery of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) and high&#8208;energy photons to treat brain tumors is proposed. The multifunctional theranostic NPs are delivered locally using bioresorbable microneedles. Then, high&#8208;energy photons generated from integrated bioelectronics are delivered by the light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles to the NPs to activate photodynamic therapy/chemotherapy. The efficacy of the proposed treatment is demonstrated with two types of brain tumor model in vivo.








Abstract
The low delivery efficiency of light&#8208;responsive theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) to target tumor sites, particularly to brain tumors due to the blood&#8211;brain barrier, has been a critical issue in NP&#8208;based cancer treatments. Furthermore, high&#8208;energy photons that can effectively activate theranostic NPs are hardly delivered to the target region due to the strong scattering of such photons while penetrating surrounding tissues. Here, a localized delivery method of theranostic NPs and high&#8208;energy photons to the target tumor using microneedles&#8208;on&#8208;bioelectronics is presented. Two types of microneedles and flexible bioelectronics are integrated and mounted on the edge of surgical forceps. Bioresorbable microneedles containing theranostic NPs deliver the NPs into target tumors (e.g., glioblastoma, pituitary adenoma). Magnetic resonance imaging can locate the NPs. Then, light&#8208;guiding/spreading microneedles deliver high&#8208;energy photons from bioelectronics to the NPs. The high&#8208;energy photons activate the NPs to treat tumor tissues by photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. The controlled thermal actuation by the bioelectronics accelerates the diffusion of chemo&#8208;drugs. The proposed method is demonstrated with mouse tumor models in vivo.

         <title>Polarons and Charge Localization in Metal&#8208;Halide Semiconductors for Photovoltaic and Light&#8208;Emitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of charge&#8211;lattice interactions in metal&#8208;halide semiconductors of different crystal structures and chemical compositions is examined. Large polaron formation in metal&#8208;halide perovskites enables excellent optoelectronic properties, underpinning applications in solar cells. In other metal&#8208;halide materials, including double perovskites, nanostructured and corner&#8208;sharing materials, the strength of polaronic effects is less certain, with further scope for investigations being identified.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide semiconductors have shown excellent performance in optoelectronic applications such as solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and detectors. In this review the role of charge&#8211;lattice interactions and polaron formation in a wide range of these promising materials, including perovskites, double perovskites, Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper layered perovskites, nanocrystals, vacancy&#8208;ordered, and other novel structures, is summarized. The formation of Fr&#246;hlich&#8208;type &#8220;large&#8221; polarons in archetypal bulk metal&#8208;halide ABX3 perovskites and its dependence on A&#8208;cation, B&#8208;metal, and X&#8208;halide composition, which is now relatively well understood, are discussed. It is found that, for nanostructured and novel metal&#8208;halide materials, a larger variation in the strengths of polaronic effects is reported across the literature, potentially deriving from variations in potential barriers and the presence of interfaces at which lattice relaxation may be enhanced. Such findings are further discussed in the context of different experimental approaches used to explore polaronic effects, cautioning that firm conclusions are often hampered by the presence of alternate processes and interactions giving rise to similar experimental signatures. Overall, a complete understanding of polaronic effects will prove essential given their direct influence on optoelectronic properties such as charge&#8208;carrier mobilities and emission spectra, which are critical to the performance of energy and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of a Durable and Liquid&#8208;Repellent Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity is fabricated by a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces. Independent of surface tension, liquid droplets can easily slide on such surfaces.








Abstract
Coatings with low sliding angles for liquid drops have a broad range of applications. However, it remains a challenge to have a fast, easy, and universal preparation method for coatings that are long&#8208;term stable, robust, and environmentally friendly. Here, a one&#8208;step grafting&#8208;from approach is reported for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) brushes on surfaces through spontaneous polymerization of dichlorodimethylsilane fulfilling all these requirements. Drops of a variety of liquids slide off at tilt angles below 5&#176;. This non&#8208;stick coating with autophobicity can reduce the waste of water and solvents in cleaning. The strong covalent attachment of the PDMS brush to the substrate makes them mechanically robust and UV&#8208;tolerant. Their resistance to high temperatures and to droplet sliding erosion, combined with the low film thickness (&#8776;8 nm) makes them ideal candidates to solve the long&#8208;term degradation issues of coatings for heat&#8208;transfer surfaces.

         <title>Liquid Wells as Self&#8208;Healing, Functional Analogues to Solid Vessels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water can act as a solid&#8208;like wall to contain organic liquids. The resulting liquid wells possess a range of unique and interesting properties, such as being dynamic, self&#8208;healing, and functional. Because the liquid&#8208;water wall can be removed and re&#8208;formed at will, these liquid wells can serve as sacrificial templates for polymer synthesis.








Abstract
Liquids are traditionally handled and stored in solid vessels. Solid walls are not functional, adaptive, or self&#8208;repairing, and are difficult to remove and re&#8208;form. Liquid walls can overcome these limitations, but cannot form free&#8208;standing 3D walls. Herein, a liquid analogue of a well, termed a &#8220;liquid well&#8221; is introduced. Water tethered to a surface with hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic core&#8211;shell patterns forms stable liquid walls capable of containing another immiscible fluid, similar to fluid confinement by solid walls. Liquid wells with different liquids, volumes, and shapes are prepared and investigated by confocal and Raman microscopy. The confinement of various low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids (LSTLs) on surfaces by liquid wells can compete with or be complementary to existing confinement strategies using perfluorinated surfaces, for example, in terms of the shape and height of the confined LSTLs. Liquid wells show unique properties arising from their liquid aggregate state: they are self&#8208;healing, dynamic, and functional, that is, not restricted to a passive confining role. Water walls can be easily removed and re&#8208;formed, making them interesting as sacrificial templates. This is demonstrated in a process termed water&#8208;templated polymerization (WTP). Numerical phase&#8208;field model simulations are performed to scrutinize the conditions required for the formation of stable liquid wells.

         <title>Electrically Induced Mixed Valence Increases the Conductivity of Copper Helical Metallopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation in the conductivity of 1D materials is of importance for nanoscale control of electrical currents. Self&#8208;assembled molecular wires containing Cu ions in the +1 oxidation state are shown to increase their conductivity by 4 orders of magnitude upon applying an electrical stimulus. The mechanism of this resistance change is attributed to the system adopting a mixed&#8208;valence CuI/CuII state.








Abstract
Controlling the flow of electrical current at the nanoscale typically requires complex top&#8208;down approaches. Here, a bottom&#8208;up approach is employed to demonstrate resistive switching within molecular wires that consist of double&#8208;helical metallopolymers and are constructed by self&#8208;assembly. When the material is exposed to an electric field, it is determined that &#8776;25% of the copper atoms oxidize from CuI to CuII, without rupture of the polymer chain. The ability to sustain such a high level of oxidation is unprecedented in a copper&#8208;based molecule: it is made possible here by the double helix compressing in order to satisfy the new coordination geometry required by CuII. This mixed&#8208;valence structure exhibits a 104&#8208;fold increase in conductivity, which is projected to last on the order of years. The increase in conductivity is explained as being promoted by the creation, upon oxidation, of partly filled dz2 orbitals aligned along the mixed&#8208;valence copper array; the long&#8208;lasting nature of the change in conductivity is due to the structural rearrangement of the double&#8208;helix, which poses an energetic barrier to re&#8208;reduction. This work establishes helical metallopolymers as a new platform for controlling currents at the nanoscale.

         <title>Enhancing Light&#8211;Matter Interactions in MoS2 by Copper Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intercalation of uniformly distributed copper into the van der Waals gap of vertically aligned MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition improves photodiode device performance. The intercalated MoS2 remains semiconducting and possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1&#160;eV. Remarkably enhanced photoresponse from the ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regime is presented.








Abstract
The intercalation of layered compounds opens up a vast space of new host&#8211;guest hybrids, providing new routes for tuning the properties of materials. Here, it is shown that uniform and continuous layers of copper can be intercalated within the van der Waals gap of bulk MoS2 resulting in a unique Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid. The new Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrid, which remains semiconducting, possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1eV, giving rise to enhanced optoelectronic activity. Compared with high&#8208;performance MoS2 photodetectors, copper&#8208;enhanced devices are superior in their spectral response, which extends into the infrared, and also in their total responsivity, which exceeds 104 A W&#8722;1. The Cu&#8211;MoS2 hybrids hold promise for supplanting current night&#8208;vision technology with compact, advanced multicolor night vision.

The intercalated MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains semiconducting and possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1&#160;eV. Remarkably enhanced photoresponse from the ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared regime is presented.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intercalation of layered compounds opens up a vast space of new host&#8211;guest hybrids, providing new routes for tuning the properties of materials. Here, it is shown that uniform and continuous layers of copper can be intercalated within the van der Waals gap of bulk MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resulting in a unique Cu&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid. The new Cu&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrid, which remains semiconducting, possesses a unique plasmon resonance at an energy of &#8776;1eV, giving rise to enhanced optoelectronic activity. Compared with high&#8208;performance MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photodetectors, copper&#8208;enhanced devices are superior in their spectral response, which extends into the infrared, and also in their total responsivity, which exceeds 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The Cu&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hybrids hold promise for supplanting current night&#8208;vision technology with compact, advanced multicolor night vision.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Multifunctional and Ultrathin Electronic Tattoo for On&#8208;Skin Diagnostic and Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional electronic skin tattoo system is achieved through the functionalization of carbon nanotubes to electrospun silk nanofiber mats. The tattoo system offers ultrathin, ultralight, biocompatible, deformable, and skin adhesion. Heat&#8208;stimulated drug delivery with controlled temperature and electrophysiological signal monitoring are possible using this electronic tattoo system in a noninvasive manner.








Abstract
Epidermal electronic systems for detecting electrophysiological signals, sensing, therapy, and drug delivery are at the frontier in man&#8211;machine interfacing for healthcare. However, it is still a challenge to develop multifunctional bioapplications with minimal invasiveness, biocompatibility, and stable electrical performance under various mechanical deformations of biological tissues. In this study, a natural silk protein with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is utilized to realize an epidermal electronic tattoo (E&#8208;tattoo) system for multifunctional applications that address these challenging issues through dispersing highly conductive CNTs onto the biocompatible silk nanofibrous networks with porous nature to construct skin&#8208;adhesive ultrathin electronic patches. Individual components that incorporate electrically and optically active heaters, a temperature sensor (temperature coefficient of resistance of 5.2 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;&#176;C&#8722;1), a stimulator for drug delivery (&gt;500&#160;&#181;m penetration depth in skin), and real&#8208;time electrophysiological signal detectors are described. This strategy of E&#8208;tattoos integrated onto human skin can open a new route to a next&#8208;generation electronic platform for wearable and epidermal bioapplications.

         <title>Atomically Thin Sheets of Lead&#8208;Free 1D Hybrid Perovskites Feature Tunable White&#8208;Light Emission from Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin crystals of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl featuring covalent bonds only in one direction are exfoliated down to single layers. The unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables self&#8208;trapped excitons with white&#8208;light emission and an extremely strong shift of the emission energy as a result of the thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites synergize the virtues of two unique classes of materials featuring intriguing possibilities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics: they offer tailorable building blocks for atomically thin, layered materials while providing the enhanced light&#8208;harvesting and emitting capabilities of hybrid perovskites. This work goes beyond the paradigm that atomically thin materials require in&#8208;plane covalent bonding and reports single layers of the 1D organic&#8211;inorganic perovskite [C7H10N]3[BiCl5]Cl. Its unique 1D&#8211;2D structure enables single layers and the formation of self&#8208;trapped excitons, which show white&#8208;light emission. The thickness dependence of the exciton self&#8208;trapping causes an extremely strong shift of the emission energy. Thus, such 2D perovskites demonstrate that already 1D covalent interactions suffice to realize atomically thin materials and provide access to unique exciton physics. These findings enable a much more general construction principle for tailoring and identifying 2D materials that are no longer limited to covalently bonded 2D sheets.

         <title>Stimulation of Local Cytosolic Calcium Release by Photothermal Heating for Studying Intra&#8208; and Intercellular Calcium Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A methodology is reported to trigger intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves by photoexcitation. Polymeric capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles inside lysosomes are individually excited by near&#8208;infrared light to transiently release small amounts of Ca2+, which can evoke abundant Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to further propagating intra&#8208; and intercellular calcium waves.








Abstract
A methodology is described that allows for localized Ca2+ release by photoexcitation. For this, cells are loaded with polymer capsules with integrated plasmonic nanoparticles, which reside in endo&#8208;lysosomes. The micrometer&#8208;sized capsules can be individually excited by near&#8208;infrared light from a light pointer, causing photothermal heating, upon which there is a rise in the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). The [Ca2+]i can be analyzed with a Ca2+ indicator fluorophore. In this way, it is possible to excite local lysosomal Ca2+ release in a desired target cell.

         <title>Multifunctional Graphdiyne&#8211;Cerium Oxide Nanozymes Facilitate MicroRNA Delivery and Attenuate Tumor Hypoxia for Highly Efficient Radiotherapy of Esophageal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A radiotherapy sensitization system that integrates graphdiyne&#8211;CeO2&#8208;based nanozymes and miR181a&#8208;2&#8208;3p (miR181a) delivery with excellent catalase&#8208;mimic activity and radiosensitization is developed for the efficient radiotherapy of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Since miR181a is secreted and predicts response to preoperative radiotherapy in human locally advanced ESCC, this strategy may offer opportunities for the clinical translation of therapies and facilitate patient&#8208;personalized treatment.








Abstract
Radioresistance is an important challenge for clinical treatments. The main causes of radioresistance include hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment, the antioxidant system within cancer cells, and the upregulation of DNA repair proteins. Here, a multiple radiosensitization strategy of high&#8208;Z&#8208;element&#8208;based radiation enhancement is designed, attenuating hypoxia and microRNA therapy. The novel 2D graphdiyne (GDY) can firmly anchor and disperse CeO2 nanoparticles to form GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanocomposites, which exhibit superior catalase&#8208;mimic activity in decomposing H2O2 to O2 to significantly alleviate tumor hypoxia, promote radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage, and ultimately inhibit tumor growth in vivo. The miR181a&#8208;2&#8208;3p (miR181a) serum levels in patients are predictive of the response to preoperative radiotherapy in locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and facilitate personalized treatment. Moreover, miR181a can act as a radiosensitizer by directly targeting RAD17 and regulating the Chk2 pathway. Subsequently, the GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanocomposites with miR181a are conjugated with the iRGD&#8208;grafted polyoxyethylene glycol (short for nano&#8208;miR181a), which can increase the stability, efficiently deliver miR181a to tumor, and exhibit low toxicity. Notably, nano&#8208;miR181a can overcome radioresistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy both in a subcutaneous tumor model and human&#8208;patient&#8208;derived xenograft models. Overall, this GDY&#8211;CeO2 nanozyme and miR181a&#8208;based multisensitized radiotherapy strategy provides a promising therapeutic approach for ESCC.

         <title>Observing and Modeling the Sequential Pairwise Reactions that Drive Solid&#8208;State Ceramic Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent ceramics are often synthesized in a &#8220;black&#8208;box&#8221; reactor, with little understanding of how multiple precursors evolve into a target material. Ab initio modeling and in situ observations are used to interrogate the phase evolution of YBa2Cu3O6+x (YBCO), highlighting the critical role of precursor selection in designing kinetically favorable synthesis pathways.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state synthesis from powder precursors is the primary processing route to advanced multicomponent ceramic materials. Designing reaction conditions and precursors for ceramic synthesis can be a laborious, trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, as heterogeneous mixtures of precursors often evolve through a complicated series of reaction intermediates. Here, ab initio thermodynamics is used to model which pair of precursors has the most reactive interface, enabling the understanding and anticipation of which non&#8208;equilibrium intermediates form in the early stages of a solid&#8208;state reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and in situ electron microscopy are then used to observe how these initial intermediates influence phase evolution in the synthesis of the classic high&#8208;temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+x&#160;(YBCO). The model developed herein rationalizes how the replacement of the traditional BaCO3 precursor with BaO2 redirects phase evolution through a low&#8208;temperature eutectic melt, facilitating the formation of YBCO in 30 min instead of 12+ h. Precursor selection plays an important role in tuning the thermodynamics of interfacial reactions and emerges as an important design parameter in planning kinetically favorable synthesis pathways to complex ceramic materials.

         <title>A Wearable Body Condition Sensor System with Wireless Feedback Alarm Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. A versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness, toward secure and comfortable lives. The multifunctional wireless sensor system can especially save newborn infants&#8217; lives during sleep.








Abstract
Emerging feedback systems based on tracking body conditions can save human lives. In particular, vulnerable populations such as disabled people, elderly, and infants often require special care. For example, the high global mortality of infants primarily owing to sudden infant death syndrome while sleeping makes request for extraordinary attentions in neonatal intensive care units or daily lives. Here, a versatile laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG)&#8208;based integrated flexible sensor system, which can wirelessly monitor the sleeping postures, respiration rate, and diaper moisture with feedback alarm notifications, is reported. A tilt sensor based on confining a liquid metal droplet inside a cavity can track at least 18 slanting orientations. A rapid and scalable laser direct writing method realizes LIG patterning in both the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations as well as the formation of nonstick conductive structures to the liquid metal. By rationally merging the LIG&#8208;based tilt, strain, and humidity sensors on a thin flexible film, the multimodal sensor device is applied to a diaper as a real&#8208;time feedback tracking system of the sleeping posture, respiration, and wetness toward secure and comfortable lives. User&#8208;friendly interfaces, which incorporate alarming functions, provide timely feedback for caregivers tending to vulnerable populations with limited self&#8208;care capabilities.

         <title>Epigenetic Remodeling Hydrogel Patches for Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Triple&#8208;Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epi&#8208;gel provides chemosensitivity recovery and immune activation via simultaneous remodeling of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;IC) stemness and innate immune response. A single dose of epi&#8208;gel pools the advantages of epigenetic therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in the treatment of multidrug&#8208;resistant triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), achieving superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional drug delivery.








Abstract
The induced expansion of tumor&#8208;initiating cells (T&#8208;ICs) upon repeated exposure of tumors to chemotherapeutic drugs forms a major cause for chemoresistance and cancer metastasis. Here, a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;responsive hydrogel patch is designed to modulate the plasticity of T&#8208;ICs in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is insensitive to hormone&#8208; and HER2&#8208;targeting. The on&#8208;site formation of the hydrogel network patches tumors in a chemoresistant TNBC murine model and senses intratumoral reactive oxygen species for linker cleavage and payload release. Patch&#8208;mediated inhibition of the histone demethylase lysine&#8208;specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) epigenetically regulates the switch of T&#8208;ICs from self&#8208;renewal to differentiation, rehabilitating their chemosensitivity. Moreover, the hydrogel patch enhances tumor immunogenicity and increases T&#8208;cell infiltration via epigenetic activation of innate immunity. A single&#8208;dose of the hydrogel patch harboring LSD1 inhibitor and chemotherapy agent efficiently suppresses tumor growth, postsurgical relapse, and metastasis. The superior efficacy against multidrug resistance further reveals the broad applicability of epigenetic remodeling hydrogel patches.

         <title>Interactive Materials for Bidirectional Redox&#8208;Based Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox&#8208;active catechol&#8208;based film can autonomously synthesize diffusible H2O2 signals that enable interactive communication with biology. The reducing redox activities of a bacterial culture provide the electrons that poise this film for subsequent electron&#8208;donation to O2 to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that induces redox&#8208;responsive gene expression.








Abstract
Emerging research indicates that biology routinely uses diffusible redox&#8208;active molecules to mediate communication that can span biological systems (e.g., nervous and immune) and even kingdoms (e.g., a microbiome and its plant/animal host). This redox modality also provides new opportunities to create interactive materials that can communicate with living systems. Here, it is reported that the fabrication of a redox&#8208;active hydrogel film can autonomously synthesize a H2O2 signaling molecule for communication with a bacterial population. Specifically, a catechol&#8208;conjugated/crosslinked 4&#8208;armed thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel film is electrochemically fabricated in which the added catechol moieties confer redox activity: the film can accept electrons from biological reductants (e.g., ascorbate) and donate electrons to O2 to generate H2O2. Electron&#8208;transfer from an Escherichia coli culture poises this film to generate the H2O2 signaling molecule that can induce bacterial gene expression from a redox&#8208;responsive operon. Overall, this work demonstrates that catecholic materials can participate in redox&#8208;based interactions that elicit specific biological responses, and also suggests the possibility that natural phenolics may be a ubiquitous biological example of interactive materials.

         <title>Ultrathin 2D Copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;Triazolate Coordination Polymer Nanosheets for Efficient and Selective Gene Silencing and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate coordination polymer, acting as both stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers of DNAzyme for cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing and intrinsic photosensitizers for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), are synthesized by a bottom&#8208;up method. After integrating the DNAzyme with chlorin e6, a type II PDT photosensitizer, the obtained nanoplatform achieves superior therapeutic performance.








Abstract
Gene silencing holds promise for cancer therapeutics because of its potential to inhibit genes involved in tumor development. However, gene silencing is still restricted by its limited efficacy and safety. Nanoscale coordination polymers (CPs) emerge as promising nanocarriers for gene delivery, but their responsiveness and potential therapeutic properties have rarely been explored simultaneously. Here, multifunctional ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate CP with a thickness of 4.5 &#177; 0.8 nm are synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up method. These CP nanosheets can act as both an effective DNAzyme nanocarrier for gene therapy and an intrinsic photosensitizer for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is ascribed to the Fenton&#8208;like reaction. Because of the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsiveness of the CP nanosheets, DNAzyme&#8208;loaded CP nanosheets exhibit excellent cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing of the early growth response factor&#8208;1 (EGR&#8208;1), with messenger RNA inhibited by 84% in MCF&#8208;7 (human breast cancer cells) and only 6% in MCF&#8208;10A (normal human mammary epithelial cells). After tail intravenous injection into MCF&#8208;7&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, the CP nanosheets loaded with chlorin&#8208;e6&#8208;modified DNAzyme under photoirradiation show a high antitumor efficacy (88.0% tumor regression), demonstrating a promising therapeutic platform with efficient and selective gene silencing and PDT of cancer.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate coordination polymer, acting as both stimuli&#8208;responsive nanocarriers of DNAzyme for cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;targeting gene silencing and intrinsic photosensitizers for hypoxia&#8208;tolerant type I photodynamic therapy (PDT), are synthesized by a bottom&#8208;up method. After integrating the DNAzyme with chlorin e6, a type II PDT photosensitizer, the obtained nanoplatform achieves superior therapeutic performance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene silencing holds promise for cancer therapeutics because of its potential to inhibit genes involved in tumor development. However, gene silencing is still restricted by its limited efficacy and safety. Nanoscale coordination polymers (CPs) emerge as promising nanocarriers for gene delivery, but their responsiveness and potential therapeutic properties have rarely been explored simultaneously. Here, multifunctional ultrathin 2D nanosheets of Cu(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate CP with a thickness of 4.5 &#177; 0.8 nm are synthesized using a bottom&#8208;up method.

         <title>High Performance of Simple Organic Phosphorescence Host&#8211;Guest Materials and their Application in Time&#8208;Resolved Bioimaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of simple organic phosphorescence host&#8211;guest materials with high performance are successfully developed. With these materials, high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are successfully realized by taking advantage of both their long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).








Abstract
The study of purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) has drawn increasing attention because of its considerable theoretical research and practical application value. Currently, organic RTP materials with both high efficiency (&#934;P&#160;&gt; 20%) and a long lifetime (&#964;P&#160;&gt; 10 s) in air are still scarce due to the lack of related design guidance. Here, a new strategy to increase the phosphorescence performance of organic materials by integrating the RTP host and RTP guest in one doping system to form a triplet exciplex, is reported. With these materials, the high&#8208;contrast labeling of tumors in living mice and encrypted patterns in thermal printing are both successfully realized by taking advantage of both the long afterglow time (up to 25&#160;min in aqueous media) and high phosphorescence efficiency (43%).

         <title>Leveraging on ENZ Metamaterials to Achieve 2D and 3D Hyper&#8208;Resolution in Two&#8208;Photon Direct Laser Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two&#8208;photon direct laser writing is enhanced to hyper&#8208;resolution by leveraging on the extraordinary laser writing collimation enabled by &#949;NZ metamaterials. The realization of ultrathin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses and a highly detailed Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221; bas&#8208;relief (500 nm full height) confirms full freedom in nanofabrication. These results show intriguing cues in trendsetting research scenarios and industry application.








Abstract
A novel technique is developed to improve the resolution of two&#8208;photon direct laser writing lithography. Thanks to the high collimation enabled by extraordinary &#949;NZ (near&#8208;zero) metamaterial features, ultrathin dielectric hyper&#8208;resolute nanostructures are within reach. With respect to the standard direct laser writing approach, a size reduction of 89% and 50%, in height and width respectively, is achieved with the height of the structures adjustable between 5 and 50&#160;nm. The retrieved 2D fabrication parameters are exploited for realizing extremely thin all&#8208;dielectric metalenses tailored through deep machine learning codes. The hyper&#8208;resolution achieved in the writing process enables the fabrication of a highly detailed dielectric 3D bas&#8208;relief (with full height of 500&#160;nm) of Da Vinci's &#8220;Lady with an Ermine&#8221;. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept results show intriguing cues for the current and trendsetting research scenario in anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications and ultracompact photonics, paving the way for the realization of all&#8208;dielectric and apochromatic ultrathin imaging&#160;systems.

         <title>A Bioinspired Elastic Hydrogel for Solar&#8208;Driven Water Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from various contaminated sources containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only natural sunlight. Since the purification mechanism relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation and does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported.








Abstract
The global demand for clean and safe water will continue to grow well into the 21st century. Moving forward, the lack of access to clean water, which threatens human health and strains precious energy resources, will worsen as the climate changes. Therefore, future innovations that produce potable water from contaminated sources must be sustainable. Inspired by nature, a solar absorber gel (SAG) is developed to purify water from contaminated sources using only natural sunlight. The SAG is composed of an elastic thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) hydrogel, a photothermal polydopamine (PDA) layer, and a sodium alginate (SA) network. Production of the SAG is facile; all processing is aqueous&#8208;based and occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, the SAG can purify water from various harmful reservoirs containing small molecules, oils, metals, and pathogens, using only sunlight. The SAG relies on solar energy to drive a hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase transformation at the lower critical solution temperature. Since the purification mechanism does not require water evaporation, an energy&#8208;intensive process, the passive solar water&#8208;purification rate is the highest reported. This discovery can be transformative in the sustainable production of clean water to improve the quality of human life.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Smart Hydrogel Releasing Immune Adjuvant Synchronized with Repeated Chemotherapy or Radiotherapy to Boost Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alginate is conjugated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based smart hydrogel is formed in situ. Low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing immunogenic cell death of tumor cells, can trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with an ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release to boost antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Certain chemotherapeutics and forms of ionizing radiation can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). If there simultaneously exist immune adjuvants within the tumor, such antitumor immunity would be further amplified. However, as clinical chemo/radiotherapies are usually repeatedly given at low individual doses, it would be impractical to administrate immune adjuvants into tumors at each dose of chemo/radiotherapies. Thus, a smart hydrogel is developed that releases immune adjuvants in response to repeatedly applied chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies. Herein, alginate is conjugated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;specific aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based hydrogel is formed in situ. Interestingly, low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing ICD of tumor cells, could trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release. Therefore, the smart hydrogel could release the immune adjuvant synchronized with low&#8208;dose repeated chemo/radiotherapies, achieving remarkable synergistic responses in eliminating established tumors, as well as immune memory to reject re&#8208;challenged tumors. Moreover, repeated radiotherapies assisted by the smart hydrogel could inhibit distant tumor metastases, especially in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. The study presents a conceptually new strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy coherent with repeated low&#8208;dose chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies following a clinically relevant manner.

However, as clinical chemo/radiotherapies are usually repeatedly given at low individual doses, it would be impractical to administrate immune adjuvants into tumors at each dose of chemo/radiotherapies. Thus, a smart hydrogel is developed that releases immune adjuvants in response to repeatedly applied chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies. Herein, alginate is conjugated with an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;specific aptamer, which is hybridized with immunoadjuvant CpG oligonucleotide. Upon intratumoral injection, alginate&#8208;based hydrogel is formed in situ. Interestingly, low doses of oxaliplatin or X&#8208;rays, while inducing ICD of tumor cells, could trigger release of ATP, which competitively binds with ATP&#8208;specific aptamer to trigger CpG release. Therefore, the smart hydrogel could release the immune adjuvant synchronized with low&#8208;dose repeated chemo/radiotherapies, achieving remarkable synergistic responses in eliminating established tumors, as well as immune memory to reject re&#8208;challenged tumors. Moreover, repeated radiotherapies assisted by the smart hydrogel could inhibit distant tumor metastases, especially in combination with immune checkpoint blockade. The study presents a conceptually new strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy coherent with repeated low&#8208;dose chemo&#8208;/radiotherapies following a clinically relevant manner.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Nanoporous Intermetallic Pd3Bi for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi is prepared through electrochemical etching of PdBi2, and it can achieve extraordinary catalytic performance with high selectivity and excellent stability for electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) at ambient conditions. The intermetallic interaction between the Pd and neighboring Bi sites in nanoporous Pd3Bi can stabilize the transition state and lower the barrier for efficient NRR.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction at ambient temperature is a green technology for artificial nitrogen fixation but greatly challenging with low yield and poor selectivity. Here, a nanoporous ordered intermetallic Pd3Bi prepared by converting chemically etched nanoporous PdBi2 exhibits efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions. The resulting nanoporous intermetallic Pd3Bi can achieve high activity and selectivity with an NH3 yield rate of 59.05&#160;&#177; 2.27&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 21.52&#160;&#177; 0.71% at &#8722;0.2&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.05 m H2SO4 electrolyte, outperforming most of the reported catalysts in electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy studies combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that strong coupling between the Pd&#8211;Bi sites bridges the electron&#8208;transfer channel of intermetallic Pd3Bi, in which the Bi sites can absorb N2 molecules and lower the energy barrier of *N2 for N2 adsorption and activation. Meanwhile, the intermetallic Pd3Bi with bicontinuous nanoporous structure can accelerate the electron transport during the NRR process, thus improving the NRR performance.

         <title>Touch&#8208;Based Stressless Cortisol Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stress&#8208;free detection of cortisol using natural finger sweat is reported. Using an electrodeposited molecularly imprinted polymer with an embedded Prussian blue probe for label&#8208;free sensing and a highly permeable hydrogel for rapid natural sweat extraction from the fingertip, the sensor, in both strip and stretchable patch form factors, can detect the cortisol level in 3.5&#160;min with a simple touch.








Abstract
Tracking fluctuations of the cortisol level is important in understanding the body's endocrine response to stress stimuli. Traditional cortisol sensing relies on centralized laboratory settings, while wearable cortisol sensors are limited to slow and complex assays. Here, a touch&#8208;based non&#8208;invasive molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor for rapid, simple, and reliable stress&#8208;free detection of sweat cortisol is described. The sensor readily measures fingertip sweat cortisol via highly selective binding to the cortisol&#8208;imprinted electropolymerized polypyrrole coating. The MIP network is embedded with Prussian blue redox probes that offer direct electrical signaling of the binding event to realize sensitive label&#8208;free amperometric detection. Using a highly permeable sweat&#8208;wicking porous hydrogel, instantaneously secreted fingertip sweat can be conveniently and rapidly collected without any assistance. By eliminating time lags, such rapid (3.5&#160;min) fingertip assay enables the capture of sharp variations in cortisol levels, compared to previous methods. Such advantages are demonstrated by tracking cortisol response in short cold&#8208;pressor tests and throughout day&#8208;long circadian rhythm, along with gold&#8208;standard immunoassay validation. A stretchable epidermal MIP sensor is also described for directly tracking cortisol in exercise&#8208;induced sweat. The rapid touch&#8208;based cortisol sensor offers an attractive, accessible, stressless avenue for quantitative stress management.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Photovoltaics using Eutectic Acceptor Fibrils to Achieve Current Amplification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary organic solar cells are fabricated, achieving a significant JSC boost by virtue of an optimized crystalline feature with the formation of a eutectic mixture with better acceptor crystalline fibrils. The optimal morphology suppresses energetic disorder and recombination and increases charge transfer and transport, yielding a high efficiency of 17.84% with significant current boost.








Abstract
The intrinsic electronic properties of donor (D) and acceptor (A) materials in coupling with morphological features dictate the output in organic solar cells (OSCs). New physical properties of intimate eutectic mixing are used in nonfullerene&#8208;acceptor&#8208;based D&#8211;A1&#8211;A2 ternary blends to fine&#8208;tune the bulk heterojunction thin film morphology as well as their electronic properties. With enhanced thin film crystallinity and improved carrier transport, a significant JSC amplification is achieved due to the formation of eutectic fibrillar lamellae and reduced defects state density. Material wise, aligned cascading energy levels with much larger driving force, and suppressed recombination channels confirm efficient charge transfer and transport, enabling an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.84%. These results reveal the importance of utilizing specific material interactions to control the crystalline habit in blended films to form a well&#8208;suited morphology in guiding superior performances, which is of high demand in the next episode of OSC fabrication toward 20% PCE.

         <title>Conferring Ti&#8208;Based MOFs with Defects for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) is successfully constructed by simple hydrogenation and serves as a new generation of robust sonosensitizer for enhanced sonodynamic therapy. Moreover, it also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to amplify production of reactive oxygen species under ultrasound irradiation. Besides, the degradability of D&#8208;MOF(Ti) is a bright spot for promoting its clinical transformation.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient, multifunctional, and biocompatible sonosensitizer is still a priority for current sonodynamic therapy (SDT). Herein, a defect&#8208;rich Ti&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) (D&#8208;MOF(Ti)) with greatly improved sonosensitizing effect is simply constructed and used for enhanced SDT. Compared with the commonly used sonosensitizer TiO2, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) results in a superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) yield under ultrasound (US) irradiation due to its narrow bandgap, which principally improves the US&#8208;triggered electron&#8211;hole separation. Meanwhile, due to the existence of Ti3+ ions, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) also exhibits a high level of Fenton&#8208;like activity to enable chemodynamic therapy. Particularly, US as the excitation source of SDT can simultaneously enhance the Fenton&#8208;like reaction to achieve remarkably synergistic outcomes for oncotherapy. More importantly, D&#8208;MOF(Ti) can be degraded and metabolized out of the body after completion of its therapeutic functions without off&#8208;target toxicity. Overall, this work identifies a novel Ti&#8208;familial sonosensitizer harboring great potential for synergistic sonodynamic and chemodynamic cancer therapy.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Sub&#8208;Micrometer Particles by Modifying the Excess&#8208;Li Distribution</title>

         <dc:description>
A lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxide (LMR) cathode for a practical Li&#8208;ion battery system through a novel structural and morphological design is reported: a relatively delocalized excess&#8208;Li system in sub&#8208;micrometer particles. The lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;stabilized LMR exhibits an outstanding energy density over other prospective cathode materials, and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention in full&#8208;cells in practical conditions.








Abstract
In recent years, Li&#8208; and Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (LMRs) have been vigorously explored as promising cathodes for next&#8208;generation, Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high specific energy. Nevertheless, their actual implementation is still far from a reality since the trade&#8208;off relationship between the particle size and chemical reversibility prevents LMRs from achieving a satisfactory, industrial energy density. To solve this material dilemma, herein, a novel morphological and structural design is introduced to Li1.11Mn0.49Ni0.29Co0.11O2, reporting a sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;level LMR with a relatively delocalized, excess&#8208;Li system. This system exhibits an ultrahigh energy density of 2880&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and a long&#8208;lasting cycle retention of 83.1% after the 100th cycle for 45 &#176;C full&#8208;cell cycling, despite its practical electrode conditions. This outstanding electrochemical performance is a result of greater lattice&#8208;oxygen stability in the delocalized excess&#8208;Li system because of the low amount of highly oxidized oxygen ions. Geometric dispersion of the labile oxygen ions effectively suppresses oxygen evolution from the lattice when delithiated, eradicating the rapid energy degradation in a practical cell system.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface is studied using near&#8208;field techniques to show conclusively topological transition accompanied by the emergence of the Wannier&#8208;type dipole polarization. Measurements across different boundaries reveal a hierarchy of topological boundary states: i) the first order edge states and ii) the second order corner states, including states induced by the long&#8208;range interactions within the metasurface.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) represent a new type of topological system, supporting boundary states localized over boundaries, two or more dimensions lower than the dimensionality of the system itself. Interestingly, photonic HOTIs can possess a richer physics than their original condensed matter counterpart, supporting conventional HOTI states based on tight&#8208;binding coupling, and a new type of topological HOTI states enabled by long&#8208;range interactions. Here, a new mechanism to establish all&#8208;dielectric infrared HOTI metasurfaces exhibiting both types of HOTI states is proposed, supported by a topological transition accompanied by the emergence of topological Wannier&#8208;type polarization. Two kinds of near&#8208;field experimental studies are performed: i) the solid immersion spectroscopy and ii) near&#8208;field imaging using scattering scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy to directly observe the topological transition and the emergence of HOTI states of two types. It is shown that the near&#8208;field profiles indicate the displacement of the Wannier center across the topological transition leading to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states. The proposed all&#8208;dielectric HOTI metasurface offers a new approach to confine the optical field in micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale topological cavities and thus paves the way to achieve a novel nanophotonic technology.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 22% via Small&#8208;Molecule Passivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate is introduced in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process, and external quantum efficiency of quasi&#8208;2D perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes as high as 22.49% is demonstrated.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are considered as particularly attractive candidates for high&#8208;quality lighting and displays, due to possessing the features of wide gamut and real color expression. However, most PeLEDs are made from polycrystalline perovskite films that contain a high concentration of defects, including point and extended imperfections. Reducing and mitigating non&#8208;radiative recombination defects in perovskite materials are still crucial prerequisites for achieving high performance in light&#8208;emitting applications. Here, ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) is introduced as a functional additive dissolved in antisolvent to passivate surface and bulk defects during the spinning process. The ETPTA can effectively decrease the charge trapping states by passivation and/or suppression of defects. Eventually, the perovskite films that are sufficiently passivated by ETPTA make the devices achieve a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 22.49%. To our knowledge, these are the most efficient green PeLEDs up to now. In addition, a threefold increase in the T50 operational time of the devices was observed, compared to control samples. These findings provide a simple and effective strategy to make highly efficient perovskite polycrystalline films and their optoelectronics devices.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms Supported on N&#8208;Doped Mesoporous Hollow Carbon Spheres with Enhanced Electrocatalytic H2&#8208;Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon sphere supported Pt single atom (Pt1/NMHCS) composite for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is fabricated by a novel strategy. Owing to the strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction in the unique N1&#8722;Pt&#8722;C2 coordination structure that significantly alters the electronic structure of the Pt 5d states, both the reduction of adsorbed H+ and the generation of H2 are promoted, thus leading to bare&#8208;Pt&#8208;like activity and extraordinary durability for HER.








Abstract
The electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI) plays a crucial role in catalysis as it can induce electron transfer between metal and support, modulate the electronic state of the supported metal, and optimize the reduction of intermediate species. In this work, the tailoring of electronic structure of Pt single atoms supported on N&#8208;doped mesoporous hollow carbon spheres (Pt1/NMHCS) via strong EMSI engineering is reported. The Pt1/NMHCS composite is much more active and stable than the nanoparticle (PtNP) counterpart and commercial 20&#160;wt% Pt/C for catalyzing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), exhibiting a low overpotential of 40&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a high mass activity of 2.07 A mg&#8722;1Pt at 50&#160;mV overpotential, a large turnover frequency of 20.18 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, and outstanding durability in acidic electrolyte. Detailed spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations reveal that the strong EMSI effect in a unique N1&#8722;Pt1&#8722;C2 coordination structure significantly tailors the electronic structure of Pt 5d states, resulting in promoted reduction of adsorbed proton, facilitated H&#8722;H coupling, and thus Pt&#8208;like HER activity. This work provides a constructive route for precisely designing single&#8208;Pt&#8208;atom&#8208;based robust electrocatalysts with high HER activity and durability.

         <title>Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Orange&#8211;Red Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials Realizing External Quantum Efficiency Over 30% with Low Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>

Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are developed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor configuration. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off is due to the high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and short delayed exciton lifetime.








Abstract
Two new orange&#8211;red thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, PzTDBA and PzDBA, are reported. These materials are designed based on the acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A) configuration, containing rigid boron acceptors and dihydrophenazine donor moieties. These materials exhibit a small &#916;EST of 0.05&#8211;0.06&#160;eV, photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) as high as near unity, and short delayed exciton lifetime (&#964;d) of less than 2.63 &#181;s in 5 wt% doped film. Further, these materials show a high reverse intersystem crossing rate (krisc) on the order of 106 s&#8722;1. The TADF devices fabricated with 5 wt% PzTDBA and PzDBA as emitting dopants show maximum EQE of 30.3% and 21.8% with extremely low roll&#8208;off of 3.6% and 3.2% at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 and electroluminescence (EL) maxima at 576 nm and 595&#160;nm, respectively. The low roll&#8208;off character of these materials is analyzed by using a roll&#8208;off model and the exciton annihilation quenching rates are found to be suppressed by the fast krisc and short delayed exciton lifetime. These devices show operating device lifetimes (LT50) of 159 and 193 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2 for PzTDBA and PzDBA, respectively. The high efficiency and low roll&#8208;off of these materials are attributed to the good electronic properties originatng from the A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecular configuration.

         <title>Optically and Electrocatalytically Decoupled Si Photocathodes with a Porous Carbon Nitride Catalyst for Nitrogen Reduction with Over 61.8% Faradaic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si photocathode with a unique design, in which the light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis components in the monolithic device are spatially decoupled, exhibits outstanding photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction activity with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 61.8% and NH3 yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode.








Abstract
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) approach is attractive as a promising route for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) toward ammonia (NH3) synthesis. However, the challenges in synergistic management of optical, electrical, and catalytic properties have limited the efficiency of PEC NRR devices. Herein, to enhance light&#8208;harvesting, carrier separation/transport, and the catalytic reactions, a concept of decoupling light&#8208;harvesting and electrocatalysis by employing a cascade n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode is implemented. Such a decoupling design not only abolishes the parasitic light blocking but also concurrently improves the optical and electrical properties of the n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode without compromising the efficiency. Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal that the porous architecture and N&#8208;vacancies promote N2 adsorption of the Au/porous carbon nitride (PCN) catalyst. Impressively, an n+np+&#8208;Si photocathode integrating the Au/PCN catalyst exhibits an outstanding PEC NRR performance with maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 61.8% and NH3 production yield of 13.8 &#181;g h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.10&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is the highest FE at low applied potential ever reported for the PEC NRR.

         <title>Reconstructable Gradient Structures and Reprogrammable 3D Deformations of Hydrogels with Coumarin Units as the Photolabile Crosslinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reprogrammable shape&#8208;morphing of hydrogels is realized on the basis of reconstructable gradient networks containing coumarin units as photolabile crosslinks. Reversible photodimerization and photocleavage of coumarins at specific regions of one hydrogel are directed by photolithography. The reprogrammed structural gradients result in distinct internal stresses and 3D deformations of the hydrogel into different configurations.








Abstract
Morphing hydrogels have versatile applications in soft robotics, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices. Controlling component distribution and internal stress within a hydrogel is crucial for shape&#8208;changing. However, existing gradient structures of hydrogels are usually non&#8208;reconstructable, once encoded by chemical reactions and covalent bonds. Fabricating hydrogels with distinct gradient structures is inevitable for every new configuration, resulting in poor reusability, adaptability, and sustainability that are disadvantageous for diverse applications. Herein, a hydrogel containing reversible photo&#8208;crosslinks that enable reprogramming of the gradient structures and 3D deformations into various configurations is reported. The hydrogel is prepared by micellar polymerization of hydrophobic coumarin monomer and hydrophilic acrylic acid. The presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride micelles increases the local concentration of coumarin units and also improves the mechanical properties of the hydrogel by forming robust polyelectrolyte/surfactant complexes that serve as the physical crosslinks. High&#8208;efficiency photodimerization and photocleavage reactions of coumarins are realized under 365 and 254 nm light irradiation, respectively, affording reversible tuning of the network structure of the hydrogel. Through photolithography, different gradient structures are sequentially patterned in one hydrogel that direct the deformations into distinct configurations. Such a strategy should be applicable for other photolabile hydrogels toward reprogrammable control of network structures and versatile functions.

         <title>Antimony Nanopolyhedrons with Tunable Localized Surface Plasmon Resonances for Highly Effective Photoacoustic&#8208;Imaging&#8208;Guided Synergistic Photothermal/Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy for preparing high&#8208;quality Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with tunable localized surface plasmon resonance is successfully developed. The PEGylated Sb NPHs show an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and good photothermal stability under irradiation at 808&#160;nm. As a result, highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergic therapies based on Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are presented.








Abstract
Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antimony (Sb), a typical group VA semimetal, has rarely been studied both experimentally and theoretically in plasmonic photothermal therapy, possibly due to the lack of effective morphology&#8208;controllable methods for the preparation of high&#8208;quality Sb nanocrystals. In this study, an effective ligand&#8208;guided growth strategy to controllably synthesize Sb nanopolyhedrons (Sb NPHs) with ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE), good photothermal stability, as well as biocompatibility is presented. Furthermore, the modulation effect of different morphologies on localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Sb NPHs in experimentation is successfully observed. When the resonance frequency of the Sb NPHs is matched well with the excitation wavelength (808&#160;nm), the PTCE of the Sb NPHs is as high as 62.1%, which is noticeably higher compared to most of the reported photothermal agents. The Sb NPHs also exhibit good photothermal stability. In addition, Sb&#8208;NPHs&#8208;based multifunctional nanomedicines are further constructed via loading 1&#8208;methyl&#8208;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&#8208;tryptophan on PEGylated Sb NPHs for a highly efficient photoacoustic&#8208;imaging&#8208;guided synergistic photothermal/immune&#8208;therapy of tumors in vivo. This work can stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations of Sb NPHs and other semimetal nanomaterials regarding their LSPR properties and inspire various potential applications of semimetals in biomedicine and sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins is reported, able to detect thermal degradation within widely used poly(ester imide) (PEI) resins. Trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products. Solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy is able to monitor long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.








Abstract
Monitoring polymer degradation is an important quest, particularly relevant for industry. Although many indirect methodologies for assessing polymer degradation exist, only few are applicable for an inline&#8208;monitoring via optic detection&#8208;systems. An inline&#8208;monitoring system is introduced for the thermal degradation of crosslinked poly(ester imide)s (PEIs) by embedding trifluoroacetyl functionalized stilbene molecules, serving as chemosensors to track the release of generated alcoholic byproducts. Nucleophilic addition of an alcohol to the sensors trifluoroacetyl functionality triggers hemiacetal formation which is accompanied by significant changes in optical properties, in turn allowing monitoring of sensor activation by direct spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectroscopy offers an easy detection tool for the inline thermal monitoring of PEI&#8208;degradation.

         <title>Superkinetic Growth of Oval Organic Semiconductor Microcrystals for Chaotic Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superkinetic crystal growth strategy is developed to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces by breaking the crystal growth anisotropy. The oval organic semiconductor microcrystals constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators, which enable low&#8208;threshold directional lasing.








Abstract
Synthesis of novel mesoscopic semiconductor architectures continually generates new photonic knowledge and applications. However, it remains a great challenge to synthesize semiconductor microcrystals with smoothly curved surfaces owing to the crystal growth anisotropy. Here, a superkinetic crystal growth method is developed to synthesize 2D oval organic semiconductor microcrystals. The solid source dispersion induces an exceptionally large molecular supersaturation for vapor deposition, which breaks the crystal growth anisotropy. The synthesized stadium&#8208;shaped organic semiconductor microcrystals naturally constitute fully chaotic optical microresonators. They support low&#8208;threshold lasing on high&#8208;quality&#8208;factor scar modes localized near the stadium boundary and directional laser emission assisted by the chaotic modes. These results will reshape the understanding of the crystal growth theory and provide valuable guidance for crystalline photonic materials design.

         <title>Metasurfaces: Near&#8208;Field Characterization of Higher&#8208;Order Topological Photonic States at Optical Frequencies (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2004376 Andrea Al&#249;, Alexander B. Khanikaev, and co&#8208;workers apply a near&#8208;field technique to investigate a higher&#8208;order topological photonic metasurface. They show that the near&#8208;field profiles reveal the topological nature of the optical modes (depicted as a torus). Topology manifests in the displacement of the Wannier center, giving rise to the topological dipole polarization and emergence of the topological boundary states observed in the optical near&#8208;field.

         <title>Chemosensors: Self&#8208;Diagnostic Polymers&#8212;Inline Detection of Thermal Degradation of Unsaturated Poly(ester imide)s (Adv. Mater. 18/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inline sensing system for degradation of polyester resins  is reported by Wolfgang Binder and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100068, which is able to detect thermal degradation within poly(ester imide) resins, widely used as a coating  material for copper wires in electric motors. Trifluoroacetyl&#8208;functionalized stilbenes act as sensor molecules, detecting the release of alcoholic degradation products by solid&#8208;state fluorescence spectroscopy, due to emission shifts induced by the hemiacetal formation, thus allowing monitoring of long&#8208;term degradation of the PEI resins.

Abstract
Monitoring of the human microbiome is an emerging area of diagnostics for personalized medicine. Here, the potential of different nanomaterials and nanobiosensing technologies is reviewed for the development of novel diagnostic devices for the detection and measurement of microbiome&#8208;related biomarkers. Moreover, the current and future landscape of microbiome&#8208;based diagnostics is defined by exploring the advantages and disadvantages of current nanotechnology&#8208;based approaches, especially in the context of developing point&#8208;of&#8208;care (PoC) devices that would meet the international guidelines known as REASSURED (Real&#8208;time connectivity; Ease of specimen collection; Affordability; Sensitivity; Specificity; User&#8208;friendliness; Rapid &amp; robust operation; Equipment&#8208;free; and Deliverability). Finally, the strategies of the latest international scientific consortia working in this field are analyzed, the current microbiome diagnostics market are reported and the principal ethical, legal, and societal issues related to microbiome R&amp;D and innovation are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in 2D Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct superconductivity of 2D superconductors is discussed comprehensively based on the material structure characteristics and modulation methods. Perspectives on the unconventional superconductivity, Ising superconductivity, and topological superconductivity are also provided on the basis of experiment&#8208;based literature to date.








Abstract
The emergence of superconductivity in 2D materials has attracted much attention and there has been rapid development in recent years because of their fruitful physical properties, such as high transition temperature (Tc), continuous phase transition, and enhanced parallel critical magnetic field (Bc). Tremendous efforts have been devoted to exploring different physical parameters to figure out the mechanisms behind the unexpected superconductivity phenomena, including adjusting the thickness of samples, fabricating various heterostructures, tuning the carrier density by electric field and chemical doping, and so on. Here, different types of 2D superconductivity with their unique characteristics are introduced, including the conventional Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer superconductivity in ultrathin films, high&#8208;Tc superconductivity in Fe&#8208;based and Cu&#8208;based 2D superconductors, unconventional superconductivity in newly discovered twist&#8208;angle bilayer graphene, superconductivity with enhanced Bc, and topological superconductivity. A perspective toward this field is then proposed based on academic knowledge from the recently reported literature. The aim is to provide researchers with a clear and comprehensive understanding about the newly developed 2D superconductivity and promote the development of this field much further.

         <title>Recent Progress in Cartilage Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the origins of the outstanding lubricity of healthy articular cartilage is crucial both to potentially treat osteoarthritis symptoms, and for the design of better biomaterials. The mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication is reviewed, and the recent development of natural and of bioinspired lubricants are explored.








Abstract
Healthy articular cartilage, covering the ends of bones in major joints such&#160;as hips and knees, presents the most efficiently&#8208;lubricated surface known in nature, with friction coefficients as low as 0.001 up to physiologically high pressures. Such low friction is indeed essential for its well&#8208;being. It minimizes wear&#8208;and&#8208;tear and hence the cartilage degradation associated with osteoarthritis, the most common joint disease, and, by reducing shear stress on the mechanotransductive, cartilage&#8208;embedded chondrocytes (the only cell type in the cartilage), it regulates their function to maintain homeostasis. Understanding the origins of such low friction of the articular cartilage, therefore, is of major importance in order to alleviate disease symptoms, and slow or even reverse its breakdown. This progress report considers the relation between frictional behavior and the cellular mechanical environment in the cartilage, then reviews the mechanism of lubrication in the joints, in particular focusing on boundary lubrication. Following recent advances based on hydration lubrication, a proposed synergy between different molecular components of the synovial joints, acting together in enabling the low friction, has been proposed. Additionally, recent development of natural and bio&#8208;inspired lubricants is reviewed.

         <title>Engineering Permanent Porosity into Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 18, May 6, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress in the emerging field of porous liquids is reviewed. These liquids reported to date are classified, and particular attention is given to their design strategies and the relationship between the structures of the porous liquids and their properties. Challenges including preparation, scale&#8208;up of synthesis, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and relatively small pore volumes are also discussed.








Abstract
The possibility of engineering well&#8208;defined pores into liquid materials is fascinating from both a conceptual and an applications point of view. Although the concept of porous liquids was proposed in 2007, these materials had remained hypothetical due to the technical challenges associated with their synthesis. Over the past five years, however, reports of the successful construction of porous liquids based on existing porous scaffolds, such as coordination cages, organic cages, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, porous carbons, zeolites, and porous polymers, have started to emerge. Here, the focus is on these early reports of porous liquids as prototypes in the field, classified according to the previously defined types of porous liquids. Particular attention will be paid to design strategies and structure&#8211;property relationships. Porous liquids have already exhibited promising applications in gas storage, transportation, and chemical separations. Thus, they show great potential for use in the chemical industry. The challenges of preparation, scale&#8208;up, volatility, thermal and chemical stability, and competition with porous solids will also be discussed.

         <title>Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from an Exciplex&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In an ordinal exciplex&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), injected holes and electrons immediately recombine to emit light. Meanwhile, an organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent (OLPL) system can store holes and electrons for a long time and exhibit luminescence by recombination. By optimizing the light&#8208;emitting layer of the exciplex&#8208;based OLED, OLPL from an OLED is achieved.








Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescent systems (OLPLs) exhibiting long&#8208;lasting emission after photoexcitation consist of organic electron donors and acceptors, that are widely used in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). Although OLPLs and OLEDs include very similar excitonic processes, long&#8208;lasting emission has never been observed in OLEDs. This study confirms the presence of long&#8208;persistent luminescence (LPL) under electrical excitation.

         <title>mRNA Delivery of a Bispecific Single&#8208;Domain Antibody to Polarize Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages and Synergize Immunotherapy against Liver Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) is evolved using yeast surface display. mRNAs encoding BisCCL2/5i or a PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) are encapsulated and delivered via clinically amenable lipid nanoparticles. Combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;Li achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers.








Abstract
Liver malignancies are among the tumor types that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly enriched and play a major role in inducing immunosuppression in liver malignancies. Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer&#8208;promoting M2&#8208;phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single&#8208;domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver&#8208;homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD&#8208;1 ligand inhibitor (PD&#8208;Li) achieves long&#8208;term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The work provides an effective bispecific targeting strategy that could broaden the PD&#8208;Li therapy to multiple types of malignancies in the human liver.

         <title>Large Fermi&#8208;Energy Shift and Suppression of Trivial Surface States in NbP Weyl Semimetal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological materials host both topological (TP) and trivial (TR) surface states in their band structure, the latter being undesired for topology&#8208;driven applications. A full suppression of trivial surface states is achieved by surface reconstruction of epitaxial NbP Weyl semimetal thin films. Moreover, large shifts of the chemical potential are induced by doping, enabling Fermi&#8208;level engineering of purely topological states.








Abstract
Weyl semimetals, a class of 3D topological materials, exhibit a unique electronic structure featuring linear band crossings and disjoint surface states (Fermi&#8208;arcs). While first demonstrations of topologically driven phenomena have been realized in bulk crystals, efficient routes to control the electronic structure have remained largely unexplored. Here, a dramatic modification of the electronic structure in epitaxially grown NbP Weyl semimetal thin films is reported, using in situ surface engineering and chemical doping strategies that do not alter the NbP lattice structure and symmetry, retaining its topological nature. Through the preparation of a dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free, P&#8208;terminated surface which manifests in a surface reconstruction, all the well&#8208;known trivial surface states of NbP are fully suppressed, resulting in a purely topological Fermi&#8208;arc dispersion. In addition, a substantial Fermi&#8208;energy shift from &#8722;0.2&#160;to 0.3 eV&#160;across the Weyl points is achieved by&#160;surface&#160;chemical doping, unlocking access to the hitherto unexplored n&#8208;type region of the Weyl spectrum. These findings constitute a milestone toward surface&#8208;state and Fermi&#8208;level engineering of topological bands in Weyl semimetals, and, while&#160;there are still challenges in minimizing doping&#8208;driven disorder and grain boundary density in the films,&#160;they do represent a major advance to realize device heterostructures based on Weyl physics.

In addition, a substantial Fermi&#8208;energy shift from &#8722;0.2&#160;to 0.3 eV&#160;across the Weyl points is achieved by&#160;surface&#160;chemical doping, unlocking access to the hitherto unexplored n&#8208;type region of the Weyl spectrum. These findings constitute a milestone toward surface&#8208;state and Fermi&#8208;level engineering of topological bands in Weyl semimetals, and, while&#160;there are still challenges in minimizing doping&#8208;driven disorder and grain boundary density in the films,&#160;they do represent a major advance to realize device heterostructures based on Weyl physics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Honeycomb&#8208;Kagome Polymer Tandem as Effective Metal&#8208;Free Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tandem cells made of n&#8208; and p&#8208;type 2D&#8208;HT&#8208;polymers can be used for effective overall water splitting. Upon irradiation, the photon&#8208;generated holes and electrons of low mobility remain in the half&#8208;electrodes and provide sufficient drive potential to promote hydrogen and oxygen evolution. Mobile charges powered by the potential difference will enter the other half&#8208;electrode, resulting in effective electron/hole separation.








Abstract
On the basis of first&#8208;principles calculations, the potential of applying 2D honeycomb&#8208;kagome polymers made of heteroatom&#8208;centered triangulene derivatives to photocatalyze water splitting is explored. The designed 2D polymers possess indirect bandgaps in the range of 1.80&#8211;2.84&#160;eV and show pronounced light absorption in the ultraviolet and visible region of the solar spectrum. With suitable band edge alignment, the examined N&#8208; and B&#8208;center polymers can generate sufficient photon&#8208;excited electrons and holes to activate the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively. The combination of lattice&#8208;inherent band features (flat bands) with chemical functionalization (potential shift due to heteroatoms) makes it possible to construct tandem cells with suppressed electron/hole recombination for effective overall water splitting. In addition, there is a potential difference between the half&#8208;electrodes that can be utlized to power&#8203; auxiliary components in self&#8208;sufficient photocatalyzers.

         <title>Interfacial Covalent Bonds Regulated Electron&#8208;Deficient 2D Black Phosphorus for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A black&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;based metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is developed by covalently bonding black phosphorus with graphitic carbon nitride. The interfacial P&#63743;N covalent bonds in the hybrid catalyst are highlighted to efficiently regulate the electron transfer from black phosphorus to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms.








Abstract
Developing resource&#8208;abundant and sustainable metal&#8208;free bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for the practical application of zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). 2D black phosphorus (BP) with fully exposed atoms and active lone pair electrons can be promising for oxygen electrocatalysts, which, however, suffers from low catalytic activity and poor electrochemical stability. Herein, guided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, an efficient metal&#8208;free electrocatalyst is demonstrated via covalently bonding BP nanosheets with graphitic carbon nitride (denoted BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c). The polarized P&#63743;N covalent bonds in BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c can efficiently regulate the electron transfer from BP to graphitic carbon nitride and significantly promote the OOH* adsorption on phosphorus atoms. Impressively, the oxygen evolution reaction performance of BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c (overpotential of 350&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 90% retention after 10 h operation) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art among the reported BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free catalysts. Additionally, BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c exhibits a small half&#8208;wave overpotential of 390&#160;mV for oxygen reduction reaction, representing the first bifunctional BP&#8208;based metal&#8208;free oxygen catalyst. Moreover, ZABs are assembled incorporating BP&#8208;CN&#8208;c cathodes, delivering a substantially higher peak power density (168.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) than the Pt/C+RuO2&#8208;based ZABs (101.3&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The acquired insights into interfacial covalent bonds pave the way for the rational design of new and affordable metal&#8208;free catalysts.

         <title>Rapid Nitriding of Titanium Alloy with Fine Grains at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanical and tribological properties are important for titanium alloys, which are used as a biomaterial. Inspiration is taken from the transfer of fine particles to achieve rapid nitriding without heating. The developed room&#8208;temperature methods result in the formation of a nitrided layer within a short period. The proposed method has the potential to improve various properties in other metallic materials.








Abstract
Multifunctional surfaces are required to design safe engineering products for human lives. Heating in a nitrogen atmosphere (nitriding) improves the tribological properties but reduces the strength of titanium (Ti) alloys owing to grain coarsening. A rapid nitriding method for Ti alloys forms the nitrided layer on the surface of a Ti alloy by bombarding with commercially pure Ti fine particles with a nitrided phase at room temperature within a short period. Furthermore, fine grains of Ti alloy are formed in the nitrided layer because of the impact of the Ti particles. These results reveal that this room&#8208;temperature method resolves the trade&#8208;off between the rapid formation of a nitrided layer and the suppression of grain coarsening for Ti alloys.

         <title>Massively Parallel Arrays of Size&#8208;Controlled Metallic Nanogaps with Gap&#8208;Widths Down to the Sub&#8208;3&#8208;nm Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic nanogaps (MNGs) are essential elements of nanoscale devices, but the lack of reproducible, high&#8208;yield fabrication methods has hindered practical applications. This work describes a simple, scalable approach for fabricating size&#8208;controlled MNGs with gap&#8208;widths as small as 3 nm. Applications of the technique include the fabrication of large&#8208;area plasmonic substrates formed from hundreds of millions of ring&#8208;shaped nanogaps.








Abstract
Metallic nanogaps (MNGs) are fundamental components of nanoscale photonic and electronic devices. However, the lack of reproducible, high&#8208;yield fabrication methods with nanometric control over the gap&#8208;size has hindered practical applications. A patterning technique based on molecular self&#8208;assembly and physical peeling is reported here that allows the gap&#8208;width to be tuned from more than 30&#160;nm to less than 3&#160;nm. The ability of the technique to define sub&#8208;3&#8208;nm gaps between dissimilar metals permits the easy fabrication of molecular rectifiers, in which conductive molecules bridge metals with differing work functions. A method is further described for fabricating massively parallel nanogap arrays containing hundreds of millions of ring&#8208;shaped nanogaps, in which nanometric size control is maintained over large patterning areas of up to a square centimeter. The arrays exhibit strong plasmonic resonances under visible light illumination and act as high&#8208;performance substrates for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy, with high enhancement factors of up to 3 &#215; 108 relative to thin gold films. The methods described here extend the range of metallic nanostructures that can be fabricated over large areas, and are likely to find many applications in molecular electronics, plasmonics, and biosensing.

         <title>Halide Perovskites: A New Era of Solution&#8208;Processed Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic mixed halide perovskites have emerged as an excellent class of materials with a unique combination of optoelectronic properties, suitable for a plethora of applications ranging from solar cells to light&#8208;emitting diodes and photoelectrochemical devices. Recent works have showcased hybrid perovskites for electronic applications through improvements in materials design, processing, and device stability. Herein, a comprehensive up&#8208;to&#8208;date review is presented on hybrid perovskite electronics with a focus on transistors and memories. These applications are supported by the fundamental material properties of hybrid perovskite semiconductors such as tunable bandgap, ambipolar charge transport, reasonable mobility, defect characteristics, and solution processability, which are highlighted first. Then, recent progresses on perovskite&#8208;based transistors are reviewed, covering aspects of fabrication process, patterning techniques, contact engineering, 2D versus 3D material selection, and device performance. Furthermore, applications of perovskites in nonvolatile memories and artificial synaptic devices are presented. The ambient instability of hybrid perovskites and the strategies to tackle this bottleneck are also discussed. Finally, an outlook and opportunities to develop perovskite&#8208;based electronics as a competitive and feasible technology are highlighted.

         <title>Sensing with MXenes: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;like electrical conductivity and a large MXene surface area are desirable characteristics for alternative sensor material. This review offers an overview of recent advances in MXene&#8208;based sensor technology that utilize the beneficial properties of MXenes. It also provides insights into low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance MXene&#8208;based sensors for next generation soft&#8208;electronics applications.








Abstract
Various fields of study consider MXene a revolutionary 2D material. Particularly in the field of sensors, the metal&#8208;like high electrical conductivity and large surface area of MXenes are desirable characteristics as an alternative sensor material that can transcend the boundaries of existing sensor technology. This critical review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in MXene&#8208;based sensor technology and a roadmap for commercializing MXene&#8208;based sensors. The existing sensors are systematically categorized as chemical, biological, and physical sensors. Each category is then classified into various subcategories depending on the electrical, electrochemical, structural, or optical sensing mechanism, which are the four fundamental working mechanisms of sensors. Representative structural and electrical approaches for boosting the performance of each category are presented. Finally, factors that hinder commercializing MXene&#8208;based sensors are discussed, and several breakthroughs in realizing commercially available MXene&#8208;based sensors are suggested. This review provides broad insights pertaining to previous and existing MXene&#8208;based sensor technology and perspectives on the future generation of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and multimodal sensors for soft&#8208;electronics applications.

         <title>Electronic and Magnetic Characterization of Epitaxial CrBr3 Monolayers on a Superconducting Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic and magnetic properties of a 2D monolayer ferromagnet on a layered superconducting substrate is studied using different experimental techniques and theoretical calculations. It is confirmed that the chromium tribromide monolayer retains its ferromagnetic order and induces proximitized magnetism on the underlying superconductor niobium diselenide. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D heterostructures.








Abstract
The ability to imprint a given material property to another through a proximity effect in layered 2D materials has opened the way to the creation of designer materials. Here, molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy is used for direct synthesis of a superconductor&#8211;ferromagnet heterostructure by combining superconducting niobium diselenide (NbSe2) with the monolayer ferromagnetic chromium tribromide (CrBr3). Using different characterization techniques and density&#8208;functional theory calculations, it is confirmed that the CrBr3 monolayer retains its ferromagnetic ordering with a magnetocrystalline anisotropy favoring an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin orientation. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements show a slight reduction of the superconducting gap of NbSe2 and the formation of a vortex lattice on the CrBr3 layer in experiments under an external magnetic field. The results contribute to the broader framework of exploiting proximity effects to realize novel phenomena in 2D&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Graphene Energy Transfer for Single&#8208;Molecule Biophysics, Biosensing, and Super&#8208;Resolution Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene is a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor with no need for labeling. To demonstrate the capabilities of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips, a variety of demonstration assays are placed on graphene using DNA origami nanopositioners. The results highlight the potential for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.








Abstract
Graphene is considered a game&#8208;changing material, especially for its mechanical and electrical properties. This work exploits that graphene is almost transparent but quenches fluorescence in a range up to &#8776;40 nm. Graphene as a broadband and unbleachable energy&#8208;transfer acceptor without labeling, is used to precisely determine the height of molecules with respect to graphene, to visualize the dynamics of DNA nanostructures, and to determine the orientation of F&#246;rster&#8208;type resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs. Using DNA origami nanopositioners, biosensing, single&#8208;molecule tracking, and DNA PAINT super&#8208;resolution with &lt;3 nm z&#8208;resolution are demonstrated. The range of examples shows the potential of graphene&#8208;on&#8208;glass coverslips as a versatile platform for single&#8208;molecule biophysics, biosensing, and super&#8208;resolution microscopy.

         <title>Switching of a Magnet by Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque from a Topological Dirac Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature switching of magnetization in a CoFeB thin film by a spin&#8208;orbit torque from a neighboring topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn thin film is reported. The &#945;&#8208;Sn film is grown by sputtering on a silicon substrate. The switching is driven mainly by the topological surface states in the &#945;&#8208;Sn. The switching efficiency is comparable to that in topological&#8208;insulator&#8208;based structures.








Abstract
Recent experiments show that topological surface states (TSS) in topological insulators (TI) can be exploited to manipulate magnetic ordering in ferromagnets. In principle, TSS should also exist for other topological materials, but it remains unexplored as to whether such states can also be utilized to manipulate ferromagnets. Herein, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching enabled by TSS in a non&#8208;TI topological material, namely, a topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn, is reported. The experiments use an &#945;&#8208;Sn/Ag/CoFeB trilayer structure. The magnetization in the CoFeB layer can be switched by a charge current at room temperature, without an external magnetic field. The data show that the switching is driven by the TSS of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer, rather than spin&#8208;orbit coupling in the bulk of the &#945;&#8208;Sn layer or current&#8208;produced heating. The switching efficiency is as high as in TI systems. This shows that the topological Dirac semimetal &#945;&#8208;Sn is as promising as TI materials in terms of spintronic applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered In Situ Gelation of Hydrogels using 2D Molybdenum Disulfide (MoS2) Nanoassemblies as Crosslink Epicenter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;triggered in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels using 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies is demonstrated. The in situ gelation of nanoengineered hydrogels has strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including phototherapy, 3D printing, and therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Light&#8208;responsive biomaterials are an emerging class of materials used for developing noninvasive, noncontact, precise, and controllable biomedical devices. Long&#8208;wavelength near&#8208;infrared (NIR) radiation is an attractive light source for in situ gelation due to its higher penetration depth and minimum side effects. The conventional approach to obtain crosslinked biomaterials relies heavily on the use of a photoinitiator by generating reactive species when exposed to short&#8208;wavelength radiation, which is detrimental to surrounding cells and tissue. Here, a new class of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation system based on defect&#8208;rich 2D molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoassemblies and thiol&#8208;functionalized thermoresponsive polymer in the absence of a photoinitiator is introduced. Exposure to NIR radiation activates the dynamic polymer&#8211;nanomaterials interactions by leveraging the photothermal characteristics of MoS2 and intrinsic phase transition ability of the thermoresponsive polymer. Specifically, upon NIR exposure, MoS2 acts as a crosslink epicenter by connecting with multiple polymeric chains via defect&#8208;driven click chemistry. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the utility of NIR&#8208;triggered in situ gelation is demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, the crosslinked gel exhibits the potential for NIR light&#8208;responsive release of encapsulated therapeutics. These light&#8208;responsive biomaterials have strong potential for a range of biomedical applications, including artificial muscle, smart actuators, 3D/4D printing, regenerative medicine, and therapeutic delivery.

         <title>Mechanism and Timescales of Reversible p&#8208;Doping of Methylammonium Lead Triiodide by Oxygen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylammonium lead triiodide thin films exhibit intrinsic semiconductor electronic properties in the absence of oxygen. Exposure to oxygen or air leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping throughout the films, predominantly due to molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies. This mechanism is reversible, and oxygen&#8208;doped films return to intrinsic upon storage in ultrahigh vacuum.








Abstract
Understanding and controlling the energy level alignment at interfaces with metal halide perovskites (MHPs) is essential for realizing the full potential of these materials for use in optoelectronic devices. To date, however, the basic electronic properties of MHPs are still under debate. Particularly, reported Fermi level positions in the energy gap vary from indicating strong n&#8208; to strong p&#8208;type character for nominally identical materials, raising serious questions about intrinsic and extrinsic defects as dopants. &#8203;In this work, photoemission experiments demonstrate that thin films of the prototypical methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3) behave like an intrinsic semiconductor in the absence of oxygen. Oxygen is then shown to be able to reversibly diffuse into and out of the MAPbI3 bulk, requiring rather long saturation timescales of &#8776;1 h (in: ambient air) and over 10 h (out: ultrahigh vacuum), for few 100&#160;nm thick films. Oxygen in the bulk leads to pronounced p&#8208;doping, positioning the Fermi level universally &#8776;0.55&#160;eV above the valence band maximum. The key doping mechanism is suggested to be molecular oxygen substitution of iodine vacancies, supported by density functional theory calculations. This insight rationalizes previous and future electronic property studies of MHPs and calls for meticulous oxygen exposure protocols.

         <title>Design of Chemically Stable Organic Perovskite Quantum Dots for Micropatterned Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes through Kinetic Control of a Cross&#8208;Linkable Ligand System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fast degradation of perovskite quantum dots (QDs) prevents the development of multicolor patterning technologies using these materials. Therefore, novel ligand systems for microsized EL device fabrication, which protect perovskite QDs from degradation through the binding kinetic control of surface ligands, are developed. The present system remains stable in various chemical environments, without critical deterioration of optical and electrical properties.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot (QD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are ideal for next&#8208;generation display applications because of their excellent color purity, high efficiency, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication. However, developing a technology for high&#8208;resolution multicolor patterning of perovskite QDs remains challenging, owing to the chemical instability of these materials. To overcome these issues, in this work, the generation of surface defects is prevented by controlling the ligand&#8208;binding kinetics using a stable ligand system (Stable LS). The crystalline reconstruction of perovskite QDs after addition of the Stable LS results in an &#8776;18% increase in their photoluminescence quantum yield in solution and it also improves the ambient stability of the perovskite QD solution. Moreover, the perovskite QDs with Stable LS can undergo cross&#8208;linking under UV irradiation. The tightly bridged perovskite QDs effectively prevent moisture&#8208;assisted ligand dissociation in film state due to the increased hydrophobicity and restricted movement of the cross&#8208;linked surface ligands. Thus, the cross&#8208;linked perovskite QD film shows improved chemical/environmental stability without substantial deterioration in optoelectrical properties. As a result, a white electroluminescent device with high resolution (&#8776;1 &#956;m) is successfully fabricated by inkjet printing using green and red perovskite QDs.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Elastic Softening of Few&#8208;Layer Free&#8208;Standing MoSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The in&#8208;plane elastic constants of a few&#8208;layer suspended 2H&#8208;MoSe2 soften about 30% while decreasing the thickness from bulk to three&#8208;layers. The results obtained employing the contactless technique indicate the so&#8208;called negative elastic size&#8208;effect.








Abstract
Few&#8208;layer van der Waals (vdW) materials have been extensively investigated in terms of their exceptional electronic, optoelectronic, optical, and thermal properties. Simultaneously, a complete evaluation of their mechanical properties remains an undeniable challenge due to the small lateral sizes of samples and the limitations of experimental tools. In particular, there is no systematic experimental study providing unambiguous evidence on whether the reduction of vdW thickness down to few layers results in elastic softening or stiffening with respect to the bulk. In this work, micro&#8208;Brillouin light scattering is employed to investigate the anisotropic elastic properties of single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing 2H&#8208;MoSe2 as a function of thickness, down to three molecular layers. The so&#8208;called elastic size effect, that is, significant and systematic elastic softening of the material with decreasing numbers of layers is reported. In addition, this approach allows for a complete mechanical examination of few&#8208;layer membranes, that is, their elasticity, residual stress, and thickness, which can be easily extended to other vdW materials. The presented results shed new light on the ongoing debate on the elastic size&#8208;effect and are relevant for performance and durability of implementation of vdW materials as resonators, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric&#160;devices.

         <title>Simultaneously Toughening and Stiffening Elastomers with Octuple Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired multifunctional elastomer with both high fracture toughness and high Young's modulus is designed, breaking through the current trade&#8208;off present in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. The octuple hydrogen bonding promotes the formation of ultrastrong nanodomains, which, together with a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase, form a bicontinuous network structure. Such hierarchical networks with ultrastrong nanodomains enhance the mechanical properties.








Abstract
Current synthetic elastomers suffer from the well&#8208;known trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. By a combination of multiscale experiments and atomistic simulations, a transparent unfilled elastomer with simultaneously enhanced toughness and stiffness is demonstrated. The designed elastomer comprises homogeneous networks with ultrastrong, reversible, and sacrificial octuple hydrogen bonding (HB), which evenly distribute the stress to each polymer chain during loading, thus enhancing stretchability and delaying fracture. Strong HBs and corresponding nanodomains enhance the stiffness by restricting the network mobility, and at the same time improve the toughness by dissipating energy during the transformation between different configurations. In addition, the stiffness mismatch between the hard HB domain and the soft poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;rich phase promotes crack deflection and branching, which can further dissipate energy and alleviate local stress. These cooperative mechanisms endow the elastomer with both high fracture toughness (17016 J m&#8722;2) and high Young's modulus (14.7&#160;MPa), circumventing the trade&#8208;off between toughness and stiffness. This work is expected to impact many fields of engineering requiring elastomers with unprecedented mechanical performance.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Magnetic Actuators with Optimal Six Degrees&#8208;of&#8208;Freedom</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small, untethered actuators that can be controlled by magnetic fields. This work introduces optimal MMRs that can display unprecedented dexterity, manipulation capabilities, and soft&#8208;bodied mechanical functionalities. It is envisioned that this work can inspire future MMRs to be significantly more competent across a vast range of applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine.








Abstract
Magnetic miniature robots (MMRs) are small&#8208;scale, untethered actuators which can be controlled by magnetic fields. As these actuators can non&#8208;invasively access highly confined and enclosed spaces; they have great potential to revolutionize numerous applications in robotics, materials science, and biomedicine. While the creation of MMRs with six&#8208;degrees&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (six&#8208;DOF) represents a major advancement for this class of actuators, these robots are not widely adopted due to two critical limitations: i) under precise orientation control, these MMRs have slow sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities (4&#160;degree s&#8722;1) and it is difficult to apply desired magnetic forces on them; ii) such MMRs cannot perform soft&#8208;bodied functionalities. Here a fabrication method that can magnetize optimal MMRs to produce 51&#8211;297&#8208;fold larger sixth&#8208;DOF torque than existing small&#8208;scale, magnetic actuators is introduced. A universal actuation method that is applicable for rigid and soft MMRs with six&#8208;DOF is also proposed. Under precise orientation control, the optimal MMRs can execute full six&#8208;DOF motions reliably and achieve sixth&#8208;DOF angular velocities of 173&#160;degree s&#8722;1. The soft MMRs can display unprecedented functionalities; the six&#8208;DOF jellyfish&#8208;like robot can swim across barriers impassable by existing similar devices and the six&#8208;DOF gripper is 20&#8208;folds quicker than its five&#8208;DOF predecessor in completing a complicated, small&#8208;scale assembly.

         <title>Electronic Drugs: Spatial and Temporal Medical Treatment of Human Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) for spatial and temporal medical treatment of human diseases are of great importance for the development of advanced biomedical integrated devices to solve unmet medical challenges. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in e&#8208;drugs are systematically introduced in terms of their device types and targeting diseases. An outlook and challenges for future research are also provided.








Abstract
Recent advances in diagnostics and medicines emphasize the spatial and temporal aspects of monitoring and treating diseases. However, conventional therapeutics, including oral administration and injection, have difficulties meeting these aspects due to physiological and technological limitations, such as long&#8208;term implantation and a narrow therapeutic window. As an innovative approach to overcome these limitations, electronic devices known as electronic drugs (e&#8208;drugs) have been developed to monitor real&#8208;time body signals and deliver specific treatments to targeted tissues or organs. For example, ingestible and patch&#8208;type e&#8208;drugs could detect changes in biomarkers at the target sites, including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the skin, and deliver therapeutics to enhance healing in a spatiotemporal manner. However, medical treatments often require invasive surgical procedures and implantation of medical equipment for either short or long&#8208;term use. Therefore, approaches that could minimize implantation&#8208;associated side effects, such as inflammation and scar tissue formation, while maintaining high functionality of e&#8208;drugs, are highly needed. Herein, the importance of the spatial and temporal aspects of medical treatment is thoroughly reviewed along with how e&#8208;drugs use cutting&#8208;edge technological innovations to deal with unresolved medical challenges. Furthermore, diverse uses of e&#8208;drugs in clinical applications and the future perspectives of e&#8208;drugs are discussed.

         <title>Beyond Color: The New Carbon Ink</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
For more than 30&#160;000&#160;years, carbon ink has mainly been used as a black color pigment. However, the recent discovery of nanocarbon materials with remarkable physical and chemical properties enables new applications well beyond coloring. This article reviews recent advances in the development of nanocarbon inks and their emergent applications, highlighting the fundamental and technical challenges as well as opportunities.








Abstract
For thousands of years, carbon ink has been used as a black color pigment for writing and painting purposes. However, recent discoveries of nanocarbon materials, including fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and their various derivative forms, together with the advances in large&#8208;scale synthesis, are enabling a whole new generation of carbon inks that can serve as an intrinsically programmable materials platform for developing advanced functionalities far beyond color. The marriage between these multifunctional nanocarbon inks with modern printing technologies is facilitating and even transforming many applications, including flexible electronics, wearable and implantable sensors, actuators, and autonomous robotics. This review examines recent progress in the reborn field of carbon inks, highlighting their programmability and multifunctionality for applications in flexible electronics and stimuli&#8208;responsive devices. Current challenges and opportunities will also be discussed from a materials science perspective towards the advancement of carbon ink for new applications beyond color.

         <dc:description>
The current panorama of hydrogel&#8208;based photonics and advances in fabrication techniques towards functional optical architectures are reviewed, evaluating their capabilities in the biomedical field. Further, the future potential for hydrogel photonic constructs to integrate into live tissues, advanced biosensing platforms, microrobotics, photomedicine, and lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip technologies are discussed.








Abstract
Light guiding and manipulation in photonics have become ubiquitous in events ranging from everyday communications to complex robotics and nanomedicine. The speed and sensitivity of light&#8211;matter interactions offer unprecedented advantages in biomedical optics, data transmission, photomedicine, and detection of multi&#8208;scale phenomena. Recently, hydrogels have emerged as a promising candidate for interfacing photonics and bioengineering by combining their light&#8208;guiding properties with live tissue compatibility in optical, chemical, physiological, and mechanical dimensions. Herein, the latest progress over hydrogel photonics and its applications in guidance and manipulation of light is reviewed. Physics of guiding light through hydrogels and living tissues, and existing technical challenges in translating these tools into biomedical settings are discussed. A&#160;comprehensive and thorough overview of materials, fabrication protocols, and design architectures used in hydrogel photonics is provided. Finally, recent examples of applying structures such as hydrogel optical fibers, living photonic constructs, and their use as light&#8208;driven hydrogel robots, photomedicine tools, and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models are described. By providing a critical and selective evaluation of the field's status, this work sets a foundation for the next generation of hydrogel photonic research.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Stretchable Ag2S Semiconductor Thin Films for Wearable Self&#8208;Powered Nonvolatile Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed synthesis of intrinsically stretchable Ag2S thin films for fabrication of self&#8208;powered stretchable resistive memory devices is presented. The device exhibits excellent switching characteristics and mechanical stretchability (52%), and extremely high thermal and environmental durability (168 h in 85 &#176;C/85% relative humidity). A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated.








Abstract
Compared with the large plastic deformation observed in ductile metals and organic materials, inorganic semiconductors have limited plasticity (&lt;0.2%) due to their intrinsic bonding characters, restricting their widespread applications in stretchable electronics. Herein, the solution&#8208;processed synthesis of ductile &#945;&#8208;Ag2S thin films and fabrication of all&#8208;inorganic, self&#8208;powered, and stretchable memory devices, is reported. Molecular Ag2S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag2S powder, fabricating wafer&#8208;scale highly crystalline Ag2S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag2S&#8208;based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;105, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &gt;106 s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high&#8208;performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real&#8208;world setting.

A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with the large plastic deformation observed in ductile metals and organic materials, inorganic semiconductors have limited plasticity (&amp;lt;0.2%) due to their intrinsic bonding characters, restricting their widespread applications in stretchable electronics. Herein, the solution&#8208;processed synthesis of ductile &#945;&#8208;Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S thin films and fabrication of all&#8208;inorganic, self&#8208;powered, and stretchable memory devices, is reported. Molecular Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S complex solution is synthesized by chemical reduction of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S powder, fabricating wafer&#8208;scale highly crystalline Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S thin films. The thin films show stretchability due to the intrinsic ductility, sustaining the structural integrity at a tensile strain of 14.9%. Moreover, the fabricated Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&#8208;based resistive random access memory presents outstanding bipolar switching characteristics (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of &#8776;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, operational endurance of 100 cycles, and retention time &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; s) as well as excellent mechanical stretchability (no degradation of properties up to stretchability of 52%). Meanwhile, the device is highly durable under diverse chemical environments and temperatures from &#8722;196 to 300 &#176;C, especially maintaining the properties for 168 h in 85% relative humidity and 85 &#176;C. A self&#8208;powered memory combined with motion sensors for use as a wearable healthcare monitoring system is demonstrated, offering the potential for designing high&#8208;performance wearable electronics that are usable in daily life in a real&#8208;world setting.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Induced Material&#8208;Insensitive Optical Response in Plasmonic Nanostructures: Vibrant Structural Colors from Noble Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optical response of materials, either at the macroscale or the nanoscale, is determined by their unique dielectric functions. Assisted by intrinsic disorder in fabrication, material&#8208;insensitive reflection is achieved from plasmonic nanostructures composed of different noble metals. The disorder&#8208;induced disentanglement between the optical response and the material properties may inspire novel applications ranging from photocatalysis to Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Materials show various responses to incident light, owing to their unique dielectric functions. A well&#8208;known example is the distinct colors displayed by metals, providing probably the simplest method to identify gold, silver, and bronze since ancient times. With the advancement of nanotechnology, optical structures with feature sizes smaller than the optical wavelength have been routinely achieved. In this regime, the optical response is also determined by the geometry of the nanostructures, inspiring flourishing progress in plasmonics, photonic crystals, and metamaterials. Nevertheless, the nature of the materials still plays a decisive role in light&#8211;matter interactions, and this material&#8208;dependent optical response is widely accepted as a norm in nanophotonics. Here, a counterintuitive system&#8212;plasmonic nanostructures composed of different materials but exhibiting almost identical reflection&#8212;is proposed and realized. The geometric disorder embedded in the system overwhelms the contribution of the material properties to the electrodynamics. Both numerical simulations and experimental results provide concrete evidence of the insensitivity of the optical response to different plasmonic materials. The same optical response is preserved with various materials, providing great flexibility of freedom in material selection. As a result, the proposed configuration may shed light on novel applications ranging from Raman spectroscopy, photocatalysis, to nonlinear&#160;optics.

         <title>Stereoisomerization during Molecular Packing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new isomerization phenomenon occurring during molecular packing is reported. Such a new type of isomerization tends to offer tight molecular packing with less voids in stacking, resulting in unique packing with abundant CH&#8230;&#960; interactions. The unique packing in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.








Abstract
Isomerization is an essential chemical process that often evokes dramatic change of chemical, physical, or biological properties. For a long time, isomerization has been known as a transformation that is induced by certain external energy such as light, heat, or mechanical force. Herein, a new isomerization phenomenon is described, which does not require external energy but simply occurs during molecular packing. The proposed isomerization is demonstrated by a series of symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) molecules, the donor of which may adopt two different stereoisomeric forms. Based on the evidence of the asymmetric isomers in crystals, the occurrence of isomerization during molecular packing is proved. Moreover, the unique asymmetric geometry in the solid state favors the restriction of intramolecular motion, resulting in highly efficient organic solids with quantum yields approaching unity.

         <title>General Synthesis of Ultrafine Monodispersed Hybrid Nanoparticles from Highly Stable Monomicelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with great uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable shell thickness is successfully synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. This monomicelle with a solidified polystyrene core has ultrahigh thermodynamic stability. Combined with a unique core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure, this monomicelle is a very general template to synthesize various ultrasmall, monodispersed hybrid nanoparticles with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
Ultrafine nanoparticles with organic&#8211;inorganic hybridization have essential roles in myriad applications. Over the past three decades, although various efforts on the formation of organic or inorganic ultrasmall nanoparticles have been made, ultrafine organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles have scarcely been achieved. Herein, a family of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a monodisperse, uniform size is synthesized by a facile thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated copolymer monomicelle approach. These thermo&#8208;kinetics&#8208;mediated monomicelles with amphiphilic ABC triblock copolymers are structurally robust due to their solidified polystyrene core, endowing them with ultrahigh thermodynamic stability, which is difficult to achieve using Pluronic surfactant&#8208;based micelles (e.g., F127). This great stability combined with a core&#8211;shell&#8211;corona structure makes the monodispersed monomicelles a robust template for the precise synthesis of ultrasmall hybrid nanoparticles with a highly uniform size. As a demonstration, the obtained micelles/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles display ultrafine sizes, excellent uniformity, monodispersity, and tunable structural parameters (diameters: 24&#8211;47 nm and thin shell thickness: 2.0&#8211;4.0 nm). Notably, this approach is universal for creating a variety of multifunctional ultrasmall hybrid nanostructures, involving organic/organic micelle/polymers (polydopamine) nanoparticles, organic/inorganic micelle/metal oxides (ZnO, TiO2, Fe2O3), micelle/hydroxides (Co(OH)2), micelle/noble metals (Ag), and micelle/TiO2/SiO2 hybrid composites. As a proof of concept, the ultrasmall micelle/SiO2 hybrid nanoparticles demonstrate superior toughness as biomimetic materials.

         <title>A Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymer Donor Achieving 17.62% Efficiency of Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) units with different side chains. The organic solar cell (OSC) based on PBQ6 as donor and Y6 as acceptor achieves a high power conversion efficiency of 17.62%, which is one of the highest efficiencies for binary OSCs with a polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.








Abstract
Side&#8208;chain engineering has been an effective strategy in tuning electronic energy levels, intermolecular interaction, and aggregation morphology of organic photovoltaic materials, which is very important for improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two D&#8211;A copolymers, PBQ5 and PBQ6, are designed and synthesized based on bithienyl&#8208;benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor (D) unit, difluoroquinoxaline (DFQ) with different side chains as the acceptor (A) unit, and thiophene as the &#960;&#8208;bridges. PBQ6 with two alkyl&#8208;substituted fluorothiophene side chains on the DFQ units possesses redshifted absorption, stronger intermolecular interaction, and higher hole mobility than PBQ5 with two alkyl side chains on the DFQ units. The blend film of the PBQ6 donor with the Y6 acceptor shows higher and balanced hole/electron mobilities, less charge carrier recombination, and more favorable aggregation morphology. Therefore, the OSC based on PBQ6:Y6 achieves a PCE as high as 17.62% with a high fill factor of 77.91%, which is significantly higher than the PCE (15.55%) of the PBQ5:Y6&#8208;based OSC. The PCE of 17.62% is by far one of the highest efficiencies for the binary OSCs with polymer donor and Y6 acceptor.

         <title>MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Derived Mesoporous Carbon Supporting Highly Exposed Fe Single&#8208;Atom Sites as Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) are successfully synthesized using NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al)&#8208;derived N&#8208;doped carbon as supports. The abundant mesopores in the supports promote mass transport during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and ensure a high proportion of FeNx sites are accessible. Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 demonstrates outstanding activity for ORR and excellent performance in both aqueous and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (Fe SACs) with atomic FeNx active sites are very promising alternatives to platinum&#8208;based catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The pyrolysis of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is a common approach for preparing Fe SACs, though most MOF&#8208;derived catalysts reported to date are microporous and thus suffer from poor mass transfer and a high proportion of catalytically inaccessible FeNx active sites. Herein, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101(Al), a MOF possessing a mesoporous cage architecture, is used as the precursor to prepare a series of N&#8208;doped carbon supports (denoted herein as NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T) with a well&#8208;defined mesoporous structure at different pyrolysis temperatures. The NC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T supports are then impregnated with a Fe(II)&#8208;phenanthroline complex, and heated again to yield Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;T catalysts rich in accessible FeNx single atom sites. The best performing Fe SAC&#8208;MIL101&#8208;1000 catalyst offers outstanding ORR activity in alkaline media, evidenced by an ORR half&#8208;wave potential of 0.94&#160;V (vs RHE) in 0.1 m KOH, as well as excellent performance in both aqueous primary zinc&#8211;air batteries (a near maximum theoretical energy density of 984.2&#160;Wh kgZn&#8722;1) and solid&#8208;state zinc&#8211;air batteries (a peak power density of 50.6&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and a specific capacity of 724.0 mAh kgZn&#8722;1).

         <title>Designing Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts for Efficient Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent advances in Cu&#8208;based catalysts for CO2 and CO electroreduction to multi&#8208;carbon products. Progress in mechanistic investigations is summarized, including the formation and adsorption of CO, C&#8208;C coupling, and post&#8208;C&#8208;C&#8208;coupling steps. Catalyst design strategies derived from the mechanistic insights are then discussed. Finally, challenges and perspectives of the future CO2 reduction development are provided.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been emerging as a high&#8208; potential approach for CO2 utilization using renewables. When copper (Cu) based catalysts are used, this platform can produce multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) fuels and chemicals with almost net&#8208;zero emission, contributing to the closure of the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Nonetheless, the rational design and development of Cu&#8208;based catalysts are critical toward the realization of highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. In this review, first the latest advances in Cu&#8208;catalyzed CO2 electroreduction in the product selectivity and electrocatalytic activity are briefly summarized. Then, recent theoretical and mechanistic studies of CO2 electroreduction on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are investigated, which serve as programs to design catalysts. Strategies for devising Cu catalysts that aim at promoting different key elementary steps for hydrocarbon and C2+ oxygenates production are further summarized. Moreover, challenges in understanding the mechanism, operando investigation of Cu catalysts and reactions, and systems&#8217; influences are also presented. Finally, the future prospects of CO2 electroreduction are discussed.

         <title>Amorphous Domains in Black Titanium Dioxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the diffusion of oxygen vacancies from the surface to inside, the regional dual structure with anisotropic oxygen vacancies at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 is obtained by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared sample exhibits superior catalytic activity, which can immediately degrade rhodamine B solution to colorless with a shake.








Abstract
Although oxygen vacancies (Ovs) play a critical role for many applications of metal oxides, a controllable synthetic strategy for anisotropic Ovs remains a great challenge. Here, a novel strategy is proposed to achieve the regional dual structure with anisotropic Ovs at both the surface and in the interior of TiO2 by constructing amorphous domains. The as&#8208;prepared black TiO2 with amorphous domains exhibits superior activity in degrading rhodamine B (RhB) solutions, which can instantly decompose RhB with just a shake. First&#8208;principle simulations reveal that subsurface Ovs in TiO2 are energetically favored, resulting in the formation of amorphous domains in the interior region via diffusion of surface&#8208;formed Ovs into the subsurface. The stable Ov&#8208;induced amorphous domains in TiO2 with enhanced catalytic performances provide a scalable strategy to practical Ov engineering in functional metal oxides.

         <title>Spontaneous Pillaring of Pentasil Zeolites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites in the absence of any template is demonstrated via heterogeneous nucleation of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. These hierarchical zeolites have a large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance. These findings highlight a facile method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in nanoporous zeolites.








Abstract
Conventional methods to prepare hierarchical zeolites depend upon the use of organic structure&#8208;directing agents and often require multiple synthesis steps with limited product yield and Br&#248;nsted acid concentration. Here, it is shown that the use of MEL&#8208; or MFI&#8208;type zeolites as crystalline seeds induces the spontaneous formation of self&#8208;pillared pentasil zeolites, thus avoiding the use of any organic or branching template for the crystallization of these hierarchical structures. The mechanism of formation is evaluated by time&#8208;resolved electron microscopy to provide evidence for the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of sequentially branched nanosheets from amorphous precursors. The resulting hierarchical zeolites have large external surface area and high percentages of external acid sites, which markedly improves their catalytic performance in the Friedel&#8211;Crafts alkylation and methanol to hydrocarbons reactions. These findings highlight a facile, commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations and improve the performance of zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Nanobelts Based on Titanium Dioxide/Zirconium Dioxide&#8211;Polyoxometalate Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub&#8208;nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.








Abstract
In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub&#8208;nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO2&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO2&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO2/TiO2 and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO2/TiO2 nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO2/TiO2 in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.

&lt;p&gt;ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) sub&#8208;nanobelts (SNBs) and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs are constructed through a nanoclusters gathering&#8211;transforming process, composed of ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, showing high catalytic activity and stability in the oxidative desulfurization reaction at room temperature. The POM nanoclusters not only facilitate the formation of SNBs, but also perform as catalytic centers.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to offering conformational flexibility, sub&#8208;nanometer nanobelts (SNBs) also outperform many larger nanobelts with large size owing to their ultrathin morphologies. However, to date, only a few monocomponent SNBs have been synthesized. This study presents a facile method for synthesizing ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMZ) SNBs and TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;PMoO (PMT) SNBs with heterostructures. The SNBs comprise ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and polyoxometalate (POM) nanoclusters, which are formed via the aggregation and subsequent transformation of nanoclusters. Significantly, these SNBs demonstrate high catalytic activity and stability in oxidative desulfurization reactions at room temperature. The impressive catalytic performance of the SNBs is aided by the POM nanoclusters, which not only coassemble with ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nuclei to form building blocks of PMZ SNBs/PMT SNBs but also serve as catalytic centers. The catalytic performance is further enhanced by the ZrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the SNBs. Moreover, the proposed synthesis method can be utilized to produce other SNBs. Thus, this method provides valuable insights into the strong performance properties of SNBs created by combining metal oxides and POM nanoclusters into SNBs, which have great potential as redox catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Improving Image&#8208;Guided Surgical and Immunological Tumor Treatment Efficacy by Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapies Based on a Multifunctional NIR AIEgen</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated surgery and phototheranostics employing nanoparticles based on a near&#8208;infrared aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen) for image&#8208;guided synergistic tumor therapy are explored to overcome respective limitations and realize maximized therapeutic outcomes and minimized recurrences. Moreover, the combined treatment of AIEgen nanoparticle&#8208;mediated phototheranostics and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induces tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy.








Abstract
Multimodal therapy is attracting increasing attention to improve tumor treatment efficacy, but generally requires various complicated ingredients combined within one theranostic system to achieve multiple functions. Herein, a multifunctional theranostic nanoplatform based on a single aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen), DDTB, is designed to integrate near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence, photothermal, photodynamic, and immunological effects. Intravenously injected AIEgen&#8208;based nanoparticles can efficiently accumulate in tumors with NIR fluorescence to provide preoperative diagnosis. Most of the tumors are excised under intraoperative fluorescence navigation, whereafter, some microscopic residual tumors are completely ablated by photodynamic and photothermal therapies for maximally killing the tumor cells and tissues. Up to 90% of the survival rate can be achieved by this synergistic image&#8208;guided surgery and photodynamic and photothermal therapies. Importantly, the nanoparticles&#8208;mediated photothermal/photodynamic therapy plus programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 antibody significantly induce tumor elimination by enhancing the effect of immunotherapy. This theranostic strategy on the basis of a single AIEgen significantly improves the survival of cancer mice with maximized therapeutic outcomes, and holds great promise for clinical cancer treatment.

         <title>An Inorganic/Organic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction H2&#8208;Production Photocatalyst and its Charge Transfer Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a CdS/PT inorganic/organic S&#8208;scheme heterojunction not only leads to efficient charge separation and transfer, but also increased redox ability and enhanced stability for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Inspired by natural photosynthesis, constructing inorganic/organic heterojunctions is regarded as an effective strategy to design high&#8208;efficiency photocatalysts. Herein, a step (S)&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst is prepared by in situ growth of an inorganic semiconductor firmly on an organic semiconductor. A new pyrene&#8208;based conjugated polymer, pyrene&#8208;alt&#8208;triphenylamine (PT), is synthesized via the typical Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura reactions, and then employed as a substrate to anchor CdS nanocrystals. The optimized CdS/PT composite, coupling 2 wt% PT with CdS, exhibits a robust H2 evolution rate of 9.28 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with continuous release of H2 bubbles, as well as a high apparent quantum efficiency of 24.3%, which is &#8776;8 times that of pure CdS. The S&#8208;scheme charge transfer mechanism between PT and CdS, is systematically demonstrated by photoirradiated Kelvin probe measurement and in situ irradiated X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. This work provides a protocol for preparing specific S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts on the basis of inorganic/organic coupling.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Immunoblotting based on a Photoclick Hydrogel Enables High&#8208;Throughput Screening and Accurate Profiling of Exogenous Gene Expression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is developed for expression screening, precise positioning of transfected cells, and immunoblotting analysis of multi&#8208;target proteins. scTAC allows for true single&#8208;cell up&#8208;sampling and enables the acquisition of continuous single&#8208;cell protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. scTAC provides a powerful tool for the analysis of biological pathways after transfection of rare cells.








Abstract
Fast and accurate profiling of exogenous gene expression in host cells is crucial for studying gene function in cellular and molecular biology, but still faces the challenge of incomplete co&#8208;expression of reporter genes and target genes. Here, a single&#8208;cell transfection analysis chip (scTAC) is presented, which is based on the in situ microchip immunoblotting method, for rapid and accurate analysis of exogenous gene expression in thousands of individual host cells. scTAC not only can assign information of exogenous gene activity to specific transfected cells, but enables the acquisition of continuous protein expression even in low co&#8208;expression scenarios. It is demonstrated that scTAC can reveal the relationship of expression level between reporter genes and target genes, which is helpful for evaluating transient transfection strategy efficiency. The advantages of this method for the study of fusion protein expression and downstream protein expression in signaling pathway in rare cells are shown. Empirically, an EGFP&#8208;TSPAN8 fusion plasmid is transfected into MCF&#8208;7 breast cancer cells and the expressions of two cancer stemness biomarkers (ALDHA1 and SOX2) are analyzed. The scTAC method clearly reveals an interesting phenomenon that transfected adherent MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit some stem cell characteristics, but they do not have stem cell appearance.

         <title>A New Conjugated Polymer that Enables the Integration of Photovoltaic and Light&#8208;Emitting Functions in One Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new wide&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer, PBQx&#8208;TCl, exhibits 18% efficiency for outdoor application and 28.5% efficiency for indoor application. Simultaneously, the PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based device also shows light&#8208;emitting function with broad emission ranges from 630 to 1000 nm and moderate external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2%.








Abstract
Exploring the intriguing bifunctional nature of organic semiconductors and investigating the feasibility of fabricating bifunctional devices are of great significance in realizing various applications with one device. Here, the design of a new wide&#8208;bandgap polymer named PBQx&#8208;TCl (optical bandgap of 2.05&#160;eV) is reported, and its applications in photovoltaic and light&#8208;emitting devices are studied. By fabricating devices with nonfullerene acceptors BTA3 and BTP&#8208;eC9, it is shown that the devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.0% under air mass 1.5G illumination conditions and an outstanding PCE of 28.5% for a 1 cm2 device and 26.0% for a 10 cm2 device under illumination from a 1000 lux light&#8208;emitting diode. In addition, the PBQx&#8208;TCl:BTA3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a moderate organic light&#8208;emitting diode performance with an electroluminescence external quantum efficiency approaching 0.2% and a broad emission range of 630&#8211;1000&#160;nm. These results suggest that the polymer PBQx&#8208;TCl&#8208;based devices exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performance and potential light&#8208;emitting functions.

An MXene/BP&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be created by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. The smart sensor system exhibits a detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. The work for MXene materials design and system integration developed in this work offers a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous detection of physiological signals without the need for an external power supply is a key technology for realizing wearable electronics as next&#8208;generation biomedical devices. Herein, it is shown that a MXene/black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered smart sensor system can be designed by integrating a flexible pressure sensor with direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitors and solar cells. Using a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assembly process to form a periodic interleaving MXene/BP lamellar structure results in a high energy&#8208;storage capacity in a direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing micro&#8208;supercapacitor to drive the operation of sensors and compensate the intermittency of light illumination. Meanwhile, with MXene/BP as the sensitive layer in a flexible pressure sensor, the pressure sensitivity of the device can be improved to 77.61 kPa&#8211;1 at an optimized elastic modulus of 0.45&#160;MPa. Furthermore, the smart sensor system with fast response time (10.9&#160;ms) shows a real&#8208;time detection capability for the state of the human heart under physiological conditions. It is believed that the proposed study based on the design and integration of MXene materials will provide a general platform for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered electronics.

         <title>Resonant Spin Transmission Mediated by Magnons in a Magnetic Insulator Multilayer Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By developing an epitaxial magnetic insulator heterotructure, the magnon&#8208;mediated resonant spin transmission enhancement effect is achieved, where transmission of magnon spin current can be increased by more than 1000% at selected frequencies. This novel effect can provide useful mechanisms for building future magnonic devices similar to their photonic counterparts such as antireflection coatings and Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities.








Abstract
While being electrically insulating, magnetic insulators can behave as good spin conductors by carrying spin current with excited spin waves. So far, magnetic insulators are utilized in multilayer heterostructures for optimizing spin transport or to form magnon spin valves for reaching controls over the spin flow. In these studies, it remains an intensively visited topic as to what the corresponding roles of coherent and incoherent magnons are in the spin transmission. Meanwhile, understanding the underlying mechanism associated with spin transmission in insulators can help to identify new mechanisms that can further improve the spin transport efficiency. Here, by studying spin transport in a magnetic&#8208;metal/magnetic&#8208;insulator/platinum multilayer, it is demonstrated that coherent magnons can transfer spins efficiently above the magnon bandgap of magnetic insulators. Particularly the standing spin&#8208;wave mode can greatly enhance the spin flow by inducing a resonant magnon transmission. Furthermore, within the magnon bandgap, a shutdown of spin transmission due to the blocking of coherent magnons is observed. The demonstrated magnon transmission enhancement and filtering effect provides an efficient method for modulating spin current in magnonic devices.

         <title>Poor Stability of Li2CO3 in the Solid Electrolyte Interphase of a Lithium&#8208;Metal Anode Revealed by Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium&#8208;metal batteries to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulates lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten.








Abstract
The solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) dictates the cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Here, direct atomic imaging of the SEI's phase components and their spatial arrangement is achieved, using ultralow&#8208;dosage cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The results show that, surprisingly, a lot of the deposited Li metal has amorphous atomic structure, likely due to carbon and oxygen impurities, and that crystalline lithium carbonate is not stable and readily decomposes when contacting the lithium metal. Lithium carbonate distributed in the outer SEI also continuously reacts with the electrolyte to produce gas, resulting in a dynamically evolving and porous SEI. Sulfur&#8208;containing additives cause the SEI to preferentially generate Li2SO4 and overlithiated lithium sulfate and lithium oxide, which encapsulate lithium carbonate in the middle, limiting SEI thickening and enhancing battery life by a factor of ten. The spatial mapping of the SEI gradient amorphous (polymeric &#8594; inorganic &#8594; metallic) and crystalline phase components provides guidance for designing electrolyte additives.

         <title>Engineering a Hydrogen&#8208;Sulfide&#8208;Based Nanomodulator to Normalize Hyperactive Photothermal Immunogenicity for Combination Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, suffers from hyperactive immunity&#8208;related permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. In this scenario, a hydrogen sulfide donor to PTT via an amphiphilic conjugated polymer (CP) (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;poly(ethylene glycol)) is integrated, for advanced NIR&#8208;II fluorescence&#8208;guided inflammatory modulation. The regulated inflammation preserves photothermal immunogenicity and promotes hyperthermia&#8208;induced wound healing concurrently.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT), one of the most&#8208;potent cancer therapeutic strategies known, is highlighted with excessive inflammatory response, while ablating cancer with immunogenic death. This hyperactive immune response may override PTT&#8208;triggered immunogenicity, exacerbate skin empyrosis, and incur permanent tissue injury and high&#8208;profile tumor regeneration. Therefore, an anticancer balance between pathological and protective immune response is urgently needed for an advanced photothermal therapeutic tactic. Herein, a gas&#8208;modulated photothermal immunogenicity strategy is proposed by integrating an amphiphilic&#8208;conjugated polymer with a polysulfide&#8208;based hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor (2,2&#8242;&#8208;dipyridyl tetrasulfide@CP&#8208;PEG) (where CP = conjugated polymer and PEG = poly(ethylene glycol)). The CP is endowed with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence capacity and favorable photothermal effect, tracing the tumor for precise therapeutics. The polysulfide donor can release H2S triggered by intracellular glutathione, which elicits mitochondrial dysfunction and robust anti&#8208;inflammation effect. Ultimately, this gas&#8208;modulated PTT strategy inhibits tumor growth remarkably and limits the magnitude of PTT&#8208;induced proinflammatory tumor necrosis factor&#8208;alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), interleukin&#8208;6 (IL&#8208;6), and interleukin&#8208;1beta (IL&#8208;1&#946;) cytokines. Moreover, the regulated inflammation accelerates PTT&#8208;induced wound healing. A H2S&#8208;modulated PTT with adaptive immune response is thus recommended as an advanced strategy to cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Melamine&#8211;Cyanuric Acid Supramolecular Nanosheets as Pseudo&#8208;Porous Catalyst Support</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular network consisting of melamine and cyanuric acid is fabricated as ultrathin nanosheets with extraordinary stability at pH = 0, serving as a pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support to simultaneously give remarkable enhancement in the catalytic stability and activity of metal phosphides for the hydrogen evolution reaction in strong acidic conditions.








Abstract
Behaving as structural protectors and electronic modulators, catalyst supports such as graphene derivatives are generally constructed by covalent bonds. Here, hydrogen&#8208;bonded ultrathin nanosheets are reported as a new type of catalyst support. Melamine (M) and cyanuric acid (CA) molecules self&#8208;assemble to form the graphite&#8208;like hydrogen&#8208;bonded co&#8208;crystal M&#8208;CA, which can be easily exfoliated by ultrasonic treatment to yield ultrathin nanosheets with thickness of &#8776;1.6 nm and high stability at pH = 0. The dynamic nanosheets form adaptive defects/pores in the synthetic process of CoP nanoparticles, giving embedded composite with high hydrogen evolution activity (overpotential of 66 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and stability. Computational calculations, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy unveil the electron modulation effects of the nanosheets. This pseudo&#8208;porous catalyst support also can be applied to other metal phosphides.

         <dc:description>
A universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite film is achieved through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and a large&#8208;organic cation. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process.








Abstract
Epitaxial growth gives the highest&#8208;quality crystalline semiconductor thin films for optoelectronic devices. Here, a universal solution&#8208;processed bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth of highly oriented &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) perovskite film via a two&#8208;step method is reported, in which the crystal orientation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 film is precisely controlled through the synergetic effect of methylammonium chloride and the large&#8208;organic cation butylammonium bromide. In situ GIWAXS visualizes the BA&#8208;related intermediate phase formation at the bottom of film, which serves as a guiding template for the bottom&#8208;up quasi&#8208;epitaxial growth in the subsequent annealing process. The template&#8208;guided epitaxially grown BAFAMA perovskite film exhibits increased crystallinity, preferred crystallographic orientation, and reduced defects. Moreover, the BAFAMA perovskite solar cells demonstrate decent stability, maintaining 95% of their initial power conversion efficiency after 2600&#160;h ambient storage, and 4&#8208;time operation condition lifetime enhancement.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Biomimetic Cascade Catalysis for Biosensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research progress on the design and construction of biomimetic cascade reaction systems that incorporate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF), for signal amplification in biosensing, is summarized. Notably, the mechanisms for the improvement of catalytic activity and selectivity of the MOF&#8208;involving cascade systems are discussed in detail. In addition, the challenges and opportunities in the way of the further design and applications of cascade systems with MOFs are briefly put forward.








Abstract
Multiple enzymes&#8208;induced biological cascade catalysis guides efficient and selective substrate transformations in vivo. The biomimetic cascade systems, as ingenious strategies for signal transduction and amplification, have a wide range of applications in biosensing. However, the fragile nature of enzymes greatly limits their wide applications. In this regard, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with porous structures, unique nano/microenvironments, and good biocompatibility have been skillfully used as carriers to immobilize enzymes for shielding them against hash surroundings and improving the catalytic efficiency. For another, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like properties and brilliant stabilities (nanozymes), have been widely applied to ameliorate the low stability of the enzymes. Inheriting the abovementioned merits of MOFs, the performances of MOFs&#8208;immboilized nanozymes could be significantly enhanced. Furthermore, in addition to carriers, some MOFs can also serve as nanozymes, expanding their applications in cascade systems. Herein, recent advances in the fabrication of efficient MOFs&#8208;involving enzymes/nanozymes cascade systems and biosensing applications are highlighted. Integrating diversified signal output modes, including colorimetry, electrochemistry, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, and surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering, sensitive detection of various targets (including biological molecules, environmental pollutants, enzyme activities, and so on) are realized. Finally, challenges and opportunities about further constructions and applications of MOFs&#8208;involving cascade reaction systems are briefly put forward.

         <dc:description>
Atomically thin quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators&#8212;a class of 2D topological insulators&#8212;promises to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Advances in materials science and engineering, alongside theoretical description are surveyed and the future perspectives for electronic applications are discussed, including the quest to realizing Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing&#8212;the next frontier in QSH materials research.








Abstract
Atomically thin topological materials are attracting growing attention for their potential to radically transform classical and quantum electronic device concepts. Among them is the quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulator&#8212;a 2D state of matter that arises from interplay of topological band inversion and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling, with large tunable bulk bandgaps up to 800 meV and gapless, 1D edge states. Reviewing recent advances in materials science and engineering alongside theoretical description, the QSH materials library is surveyed with focus on the prospects for QSH&#8208;based device applications. In particular, theoretical predictions of nontrivial superconducting pairing in the QSH state toward Majorana&#8208;based topological quantum computing are discussed, which are the next frontier in QSH materials research.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Bio&#8208;Chemo&#8208;Mechanical&#8208;Systems: Micromotors, Microfluidics, and Nanozymes for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors, microfluidics, and nanozymes have originated as independent disciplines&#8212;today, their convergence can help solve each discipline's challenges and lead to essential advantages in bioapplications. Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.








Abstract
Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.

Nanozymes significantly expand the scope of chemical reactions and fuels of catalytic micromotors with integrated dynamic responses. Microfluidics is used to mass&#8208;produce micromotors with optimal size, compositions, and core&#8211;shell properties for biomedical imaging and theranostics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wireless nano&#8208;/micromotors powered by chemical reactions and/or external fields generate motive forces, perform tasks, and significantly extend short&#8208;range dynamic responses of passive biomedical microcarriers. However, before micromotors can be translated into clinical use, several major problems, including the biocompatibility of materials, the toxicity of chemical fuels, and deep tissue imaging methods, must be solved. Nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like characteristics (e.g., catalase, oxidase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), that is, nanozymes, can significantly expand the scope of micromotors&#8217; chemical fuels. A convergence of nanozymes, micromotors, and microfluidics can lead to a paradigm shift in the fabrication of multifunctional micromotors in reasonable quantities, encapsulation of desired subsystems, and engineering of FDA&#8208;approved core&#8211;shell structures with tuneable biological, physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Microfluidic methods are used to prepare stable bubbles/microbubbles and capsules integrating ultrasound, optoacoustic, fluorescent, and magnetic resonance imaging modalities. The aim here is to discuss an interdisciplinary approach of three independent emerging topics: micromotors, nanozymes, and microfluidics to creatively: 1) embrace new ideas, 2) think across boundaries, and 3) solve problems whose solutions are beyond the scope of a single discipline toward the development of micro&#8208;bio&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical&#8208;systems for diverse bioapplications.&lt;/p&gt;
