         <title>Capillary&#8208;Driven 3D Open Fluidic Networks for Versatile Continuous Flow Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs), composed of connected polyhedral frames, enable precise, programmable, and versatile manipulation of unary, binary, and multiple continuous flows in both spatial and temporal dimensions. OFNs represent a significant leap beyond conventional microfluidics, unlocking new possibilities for selective metallization, programmable mixing, spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, and enhanced mass and heat transfer.








Abstract
Human civilization hinges on the capability to manipulate continuous flows. However, continuous flows are often regulated in closed&#8208;pipe configurations to address their instability, isolating the flows from the environment and considerably restricting their functionality. Manipulating continuous flows in open systems remains challenging. Here, capillary&#8208;driven 3D open fluidic networks (OFNs) composed of connected polyhedral frames are reported. Each frame acts as a fluid chamber with free interfaces that enable fluid entry and exit; the connecting rods function as valves, allowing precise control over the direction, velocity, and path of the flow. The OFNs seamlessly adapt to various fluid systems, enabling precise 3D manipulation of multiple flows. Leveraging these distinctive features, a series of applications, including selective metallization, programmable mixing and diagnostics, and spatiotemporal control of multi&#8208;step reactions, are achieved. The OFNs&#8217; free fluid interfaces also facilitate controlled drug release and efficient heat exchange. These versatile OFNs will significantly advance technological innovations in engineering, microfluidics, interfacial chemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Highly Efficient Wavelength Red&#8208;Shift Regulating Strategy of Carbon Dots Composites via the Effective Conjugated Domain and the Hydrogen Bonding Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study uses a structurally fixed conjugation molecule as a precursor. It efficiently forms carbon core states of carbon dots. This approach optimizes the control over the conjugated domain size of the carbon core. It also significantly enhances the synthetic efficiency of CDs and the tunability of the optical properties.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent (RTP) materials hold significant potential for applications in lighting, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption. However, regulating RTP emission wavelengths, especially shifting into the red spectral region, remains challenging due to the spin&#8208;forbidden transitions of triplet&#8208;state excitons and non&#8208;radiative decay. To address this issue, carbon dots (CDs) with different conjugated domain sizes and phosphorescent potential are designed and synthesized. The CDs are then encapsulated in polyacrylamide (PAM), resulting in multicolored RTP emission ranging from cyan to red (465&#8211;635 nm), with cyan and red phosphorescence exceeding 10 s and 2 s, respectively. The mechanism suggests that the enhanced conjugation effect leads to energy level splitting and strengthened electron coupling, which lowers the energy gap between singlet and triplet excitons, ultimately causing a redshift in the phosphorescent emission wavelength. Meanwhile, the introduction of hydrogen bonding protects the excited state of the electrons, suppresses non&#8208;radiative transitions, and induces RTP in the CDs. These materials are applied in multi&#8208;level information encryption and time&#8208;delayed LED illumination, offering novel strategies for high&#8208;security technologies and advanced optical devices.

         <title>Gradient Doping for Stress&#8208;Relief in Vapor&#8208;deposited Perovskite Film to Achieve High&#8208;performance p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells with a 23% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gradient doping strategy based on vapor deposition is proposed, which effectively reduces the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, promotes uniform crystallization, and applies pre&#8208;compressive stress to the surface of the perovskite film, thereby effectively alleviating the residual stress and achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite.








Abstract
Vapor&#8208;deposited p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) present key advantages such as low cost, excellent stability, low&#8208;temperature fabrication, and compatibility with tandem architectures, positioning them as strong contenders for industrial&#8208;scale solar applications. However, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) remains lower than that of n&#8208;i&#8208;p architectures. Herein, a gradient doping strategy to alleviate the stress in vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite films is introduced. Gradient chloride doping in the perovskite precursor film effectively slows the crystallization rate at the bottom layer, facilitating uniform crystallization and mitigating residual strain. This method yielded high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a PCE of 23.0% for p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs with vapor&#8208;deposited perovskite and 21.43% for entirely vapor&#8208;deposited PSCs. Additionally, the devices demonstrates outstanding stability, showing negligible performance degradation over 1600 h of nitrogen storage and maintaining 87.3% of their initial PCE after 500 h of maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;sun equivalent illumination at 70% relative humidity. The gradient doping strategy provides valuable insights for advancing large&#8208;area and perovskite&#8208;textured silicon tandem solar cells.

         <title>In Situ Formation of a Bi/Mg&#8208;Based Hybrid Interphase for Highly Reversible Magnesium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer is formed on the Mg foil via an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8722;solid redox reaction. Magnesiophilic components enhance Mg ion transfer, desolvation, and nucleation kinetics, whereas magnesiophobic species confer passivation&#8208;free and corrosion&#8208;resistant properties. Consequently, the smooth anode&#8208;electrolyte interphase facilitates homogeneous charge/ion distribution, promoting a highly reversible Mg plating/stripping process.








Abstract
Magnesium (Mg) is a promising anode material for magnesium metal batteries (MMBs) owing to its high specific capacity, excellent safety profile, and abundant availability. However, pristine Mg anodes suffer from uneven plating/stripping and surface passivation/corrosion, limiting the safety and cycling stability of MMBs. This study introduces a Bi/Mg&#8208;based hybrid interphase protective layer on Mg foil (denoted Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg) through an in situ quasi&#8208;solid&#8211;solid redox reaction by immersing the foil in a bismuth oxybromide suspension. The resulting interphase layer consists of magnesiophilic components (Bi metal and Bi2Mg3 alloy) and magnesiophobic species (MgO, MgBr2, and BiBr3). These components synergistically enhance the desolvation, nucleation, and deposition kinetics, mitigate side reactions, and promote uniform electric field and ion flux distributions. As a result, the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg electrodes exhibit superior Mg plating/stripping reversibility, maintaining stable performance for over 4100&#160;h in the all&#8208;phenyl complex electrolyte and 2900&#160;h in the Mg(TFSI)2 electrolyte, significantly outperforming pristine Mg electrodes. Furthermore, full cells paired with Mo6S8 and S cathodes demonstrate excellent capacities, rate capabilities, and long lifespans, highlighting the exceptional electrochemical performance of the Bi&#8208;Mg@Mg anode. This study offers a promising strategy for developing highly reversible Mg anodes, paving the way for practical long&#8208;cycle MMBs.

         <title>Inorganic Dielectric Materials Coupling Micro&#8208;/Nanoarchitectures for State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;Electrical Energy Conversion Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion devices are uniquely suited for self&#8208;driven physiological information monitoring and powering human&#8211;computer interaction systems. These devices based on micro&#8208;/nanoarchitectured inorganic dielectric materials (MNIDMs) have shown ultrahigh electromechanical performance and thus great potential for practical deployment. This review constructs a nexus among MNIDMs and all kinds of biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion nanogenerators in terms of material development.








Abstract
Biomechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion technology rapidly developed with the emergence of nanogenerators (NGs) in 2006, which proves promising in distributed energy management for the Internet of Things, self&#8208;powered sensing, and human&#8211;computer interaction.

&lt;p&gt;Biomechanical-to-electrical energy conversion devices are uniquely suited for self-driven physiological information monitoring and powering human&#8211;computer interaction systems. These devices based on micro-/nanoarchitectured inorganic dielectric materials (MNIDMs) have shown ultrahigh electromechanical performance and thus great potential for practical deployment. This review constructs a nexus among MNIDMs and all kinds of biomechanical-to-electrical energy conversion nanogenerators in terms of material development.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biomechanical-to-electrical energy conversion technology rapidly developed with the emergence of nanogenerators (NGs) in 2006, which proves promising in distributed energy management for the Internet of Things, self-powered sensing, and human&#8211;computer interaction. Recently, researchers have increasingly integrated inorganic dielectric materials (IDMs) and micro-/nanoarchitectures into various types of NGs (i.e., triboelectric, piezoelectric, and flexoelectric NGs).

         <title>Lipid Nanoparticles Enhance mRNA Delivery to the Central Nervous System Upon Intrathecal Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for enhancing mRNA delivery to the central nervous system via intrathecal injection. By chemically engineering brain&#8208;targeting small molecules into ionizable lipids (BLs), the developed BLNPs effectively facilitate mRNA delivery across the brain. Intrathecal administration of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA using the lead BLNP achieves significant gene editing in the brain with minimal off&#8208;target effects.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticle&#8208;messenger RNA formulations have garnered significant attention for their therapeutic potential in infectious diseases, cancer and genetic disorders. However, effective mRNA delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) remains a formidable challenge. To overcome this limitation, a class of brain&#8208;targeting lipids (BLs) is developed by incorporating brain&#8208;targeting small molecules with amino lipids and formulated them with helper lipids to generate brain&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles (BLNPs) for mRNA delivery. Screening studies led to a lead formulation, TD5 BLNPs, outperforming FDA&#8208;approved DLin&#8208;MC3&#8208;DMA LNPs in delivering mRNA to the brain upon intrathecal injection. Specifically, a single intrathecal injection of TD5 BLNP&#8208;GFP mRNA led to GFP expression in 29.6% of neurons and 38.1% of astrocytes across the brain. In an Ai14 mouse model, TD5 BLNP&#8208;Cre recombinase mRNA treatment induced tdTomato expression in &#8776;30% of neurons and 40% of astrocytes across major brain regions. Notably, delivery of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA complex using TD5 BLNPs achieved effective genome editing in the brain. Additionally, TD5 BLNPs showed comparable safety profiles to MC3 LNPs, indicating promising biocompatibility. Overall, this TD5 BLNP formulation effectively delivers mRNA to brain tissues via intrathecal injection and facilitates efficient expression in both neurons and astrocytes, presenting a potential strategy for treating CNS diseases.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy Through Skeleton&#8208;Homologous Nanoparticles: a Rational Material Design for High&#8208;Efficient and High&#8208;Contrast Theranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design of skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles for highly efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostics is reported. The nanoparticles synchronously exhibit thermally activated delayed fluorescence (40&#160;&#181;s) and generate multiple ROS, enabling TRI&#8208;guided PDT, where TRI eliminates the background noise and guides PDT accurately.








Abstract
Although photoluminescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) is promising for theranostics, it easily suffers from tissue autofluorescence and PDT photoproducts. To develop time&#8208;resolved imaging (TRI)&#8208;guided PDT with long&#8208;lived emission pathways, like thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), is urgent but challenging, because of the triplet competition between radiative transition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Herein, skeleton&#8208;homologous nanoparticles are designed and constructed to address this dilemma, thereby achieving in vivo TRI&#8208;guided PDT for the first time. This system is formed with a lipophilic TADF core (as a TRI probe) encapsulated by an amphiphilic photosensitizer shell (as the corona exposed to oxygen for PDT), both of which are derived from the same donor&#8211;acceptor skeleton to minimize phase separation in the single entity, and enable the same long&#8208;wavelength photoexcitation for TRI and PDT. The chloropropylamine group is helpful for endoplasmic reticulum targeting to enhance PDT upon minimizing the ROS transmission path. Synchronously, the TADF core exhibits a delayed fluorescence of 40 &#181;s for a clear TRI. The NPs are eventually applied in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (45.25) and outstanding PDT effects in a mouse model of deep&#8208;seated kidney cancer. Such a material design is beneficial for developing high&#8208;efficient and high&#8208;contrast theranostic approaches.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co&#8211;Ru Dimer Catalyst Boosts Conversion of Polysulfides toward High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co&#8722;Ru dimer catalyst synthesized by a confined pyrolysis strategy shows the orbital coupling effect derived from the atomic pair, which could reduce energy barrier of lithium polysulfides conversion and Li2S dissociation, thus accelerating the catalytic kinetics and achieving the enhanced Li&#8722;S battery performance.








Abstract
The sluggish sulfur redox reaction in lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) batteries triggers the development of highly active electrocatalysts for accelerating the polysulfides conversion kinetics. Rational design of catalysts with satisfactory active sites and high atom utilization toward multistep sulfur&#8208;based conversion is much desired but remains challenging. Here, it is shown that the well&#8208;designed Co&#8722;Ru dimer sites confined on carbon matrix could effectively manipulate the sulfur&#8208;involved conversion reactions and thus improve Li&#8722;S batteries performance. The orbital coupling of Co&#8722;Ru dimer induces the orbital regulation for the atomic pair, resulting the favored lithium polysulfides adsorption strength and lowed conversion energy barrier, as confirmed by systematic electrochemical characterizations and theoretical calculation. Besides, the intrinsic catalytic activity of Ru from Co&#8211;Ru moiety also accelerates the Li2S dissociation reaction. Taken together, the as&#8208;constructed Co&#8211;Ru dimer sites render the Li&#8722;S battery with excellent performance, delivering energy density of 468&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 of total assembled pouch cell. This study offers a rational design of catalysts for boosting the catalytic performance in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Pixel with Only a Single Perovskite Photodiode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;color pixel with only a single perovskite photodiode is presented. By integrating multiple photoresponse mechanisms into one device, spectral information is encoded directly into its impedance characteristics. Machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction enables accurate color retrieval without the need for additional optical components or modulation. The RGB reconstruction error is kept below 2%.








Abstract
Photodetectors typically provide only 1D information about light intensity. Even the most basic color sensing requires external optical components, such as integrated filters. This limitation of information richness has only been overcome in recent years at the cost of spatial inefficiencies in multidetector integration designs or challenges in precisely controlling in situ modulation in single&#8208;detector designs. Acquiring high&#8208;dimensional color information with a single photodetector without external components, integration, or modulation remains a significant challenge that is aimed to resolve in this work. Due to the differences in carrier excitation by photons of varying energies, the simultaneous introduction of both electronic and ionic photoconductivity mechanisms enables the spectral characteristics of the unknown exciting light to be embedded within the impedance features of the device. By extracting impedance spectra and using machine learning&#8208;based reconstruction, a full&#8208;color pixel is achieved for the first time with just a single photodetector.

         <title>Nanoconfinement of Ammonia Borane via Hybrid&#8208;Phased Titanate Nanocrystals Enables Sustained H2 Release for Diabetic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unique oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid phased titanates are leveraged to achieve nanoconfinement of ammonia borane (AB) via a distinctive one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This approach enables sustained H2 release while mitigating the detrimental reaction between AB and hydrogen peroxide in pathological conditions. The released H2, in synergy with magnesium ions, effectively promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration in a diabetic model.









Abstract
Despite its potential in hydrogen (H2) therapy, ammonia borane (AB) has limited biomedical applications due to its uncontrolled hydrolysis rate and potential to cause cytotoxicity. Existing material&#8208;based delivery strategies focus on accelerating AB hydrolysis for H2 production, hence exacerbating these issues. A new nanoconfinement strategy is reported, which loads AB onto oxygen&#8208;deficient, hybrid&#8208;phased titanate nanocrystals on implant surfaces through a unique one&#8208;end&#8208;anchored docking (OEAD) mechanism. This nanoconfinement strategy effectively restricts the release of AB molecules, allowing only water molecules to infiltrate the interlayer space for slow hydrolysis and sustained H2 release. This significantly prolongs the duration of H2 release and effectively circumvents the cytotoxicity associated with AB interacting with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the inflammatory microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo have shown that sustained H2 release from the implant surface effectively alleviates diabetes&#8208;related oxidative stress, and combined with the release of magnesium ions (Mg2+) synergistically promotes innervated&#8208;vascularized bone regeneration.

         <title>Promoting Phase Transition in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites For High&#8208;Performance Pure&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films have a wide phase component distribution. Yu et&#160;al. show that introducing acetate anions promote the in situ phase transition from low&#8208;n to high&#8208;n phases. The enhanced phase transformation efficiency enables high&#8208;performance pure&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes with an emission peak of 641 nm and peak external quantum efficiency of 25.3%.








Abstract
Layered quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D)&#160;halide perovskites have emerged as a promising platform for high&#8208;efficiency electroluminescence. Narrowing the multi&#8208;quantum well distribution and eliminating wide&#8208;bandgap 2D phases are crucial for achieving a flat energy landscape, minimizing energy loss, and ensuring high&#8208;color&#8208;purity emission. Here, it is demonstrated that solution&#8208;processed quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films with broad component distributions arise from an incomplete kinetic transition from low&#8208;n (n, quantum well thickness) to high&#8208;n phases. To address this, an acetate anion treatment strategy is proposed, which induces competitive coordination between the acetate anion, the bulky spacer cation, and the inorganic layer, thereby facilitating the insertion of octahedral precursor ions and promoting phase transition. This treatment results in quasi&#8208;2D films with enhanced color purity, efficient energy transfer, and high photoluminescence quantum yield. The fabricated perovskite light emitting diode&#160;(PeLED) exhibits an emission peak at 641&#160;nm and a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 25.3%, representing one of the most efficient pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. The strategy also showcases the versatility of quasi&#8208;2D films for different emission wavelengths.

         <title>Symmetry is the Key to the Design of Reticular Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computational prediction of the molecular structure of porous materials, particularly reticular framework materials such as MOFs and COFs, remains a significant challenge. Considering the symmetry of the building blocks that form the desired material, and a similarity score with existing experimentally characterized structures, helps identify promising new candidates; which can subsequently be used for further computational modeling and experimental validation.








Abstract
De novo prediction of reticular framework structures is a challenging task for chemists and materials scientists. Herein, a computational workflow that predicts a list of possible reticular frameworks based on only the connectivity and symmetry of node and linker building blocks is presented. This list is ranked based on the occurrence of topologies in known structures, thus providing a manageable number of structures that can be optimized using density functional theory, and inform future experiments. This workflow is broadly applicable, correctly predicts known reticular materials, and furthermore identifies novel unknown phases for some systems. This workflow is available online at https://rationaldesign.pythonanywhere.com/.

         <title>A Gradient Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composite via Crisscross Assembly of Aligned Hybrid Nanowires for Excellent Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites (GEMC) are fabricated by the magnetic&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;directional freezing assembly of amorphous ZrO2 layer&#8208;coated hydroxyapatite nanowires and subsequently, scalable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly with nanowires&#8217; direction crossed stacking. The enamel analog exhibits high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. Such an enamel biomimetic strategy offers guidelines for the engineering of gradient structure materials with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
Materials with excellent comprehensive mechanical properties (e.g., strength and toughness, stiffness and damping, fatigue et&#160;al.) are highly desirable for engineering applications, while it is still challenged for design. Tooth enamel is a typical biomaterial with outstanding mechanical properties that originate from its multiscale and gradient structure. Some composites with enamel&#8208;like multiscale structures are successfully synthesized, but mimicking the gradient structure of tooth enamel is still difficult to realize. Here, an enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites exhibited high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. The interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic, fundamentally accounted for high mechanical performance. The gradient design strategy provides an avenue for the engineering of structural materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>Precision Synthesis of a Single Chain Polymorph of a 2D Solid within Single&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise synthesis of 1D materials has enabled the discovery of physical properties only accessible in length scales close to the atomic scale. Herein, it is demonstrated that encapsulation within single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with matching diameters leads to a stoichiometric quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals polymorph of a 2D pnictogen chalcogenide, Sb2Te3, with a blue&#8208;shifted band gap in the short&#8208;wave infrared regime.








Abstract
The discovery and synthesis of atomically precise low&#8208;dimensional inorganic materials have led to numerous unusual structural motifs and nascent physical properties. However, access to low&#8208;dimensional van der Waals (vdW)&#8208;bound analogs of bulk crystals is often limited by chemical considerations arising from structural factors like atomic radii, bonding or coordination, and electronegativity. Using single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) as confinement templates, we demonstrate the synthesis of a short&#8208;wave infrared&#8208;absorbing quasi&#8208;1D (q&#8208;1D) chain polymorph of Sb2Te3 ([Sb4Te6]n) that is structurally and electronically distinct from its 2D counterpart. It is found that the q&#8208;1D chain polymorph has both three&#8208; and five&#8208;coordinate Sb atoms covalently bonded to Te and is thermodynamically stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between the encapsulated chain and the model SWCNT. The complementary experimental and computational results demonstrate the synthetic advantage of vdW nanotube confinement in the discovery of low&#8208;dimensional polytypes with drastically altered physical properties and potential applications in energy conversion processes.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Tethered Nucleic Acid Therapeutics Program Robust and Tumor&#8208;Responsive Enhancement of Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This study develops cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored tumor&#8208;responsive nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to arm ACT cells by synergistic blockade of inhibitory pathways. NAT backpacks substantially improve the efficacy of ACT and are broadly applicable to various ACTs involving TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) against solid tumors is significantly limited by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Systemic administration of immunostimulants provides inadequate support to ACT cells and often elicits systemic toxicities. Here we present cell&#8208;surface&#8208;anchored nucleic acid therapeutics (NATs) to robustly enhance ACT through synergistic blockade of immunosuppressive adenosine and PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathways in tumors. Two distinct NATs&#8208;DNA aptamers targeting PD&#8208;L1 (aptPD&#8208;L1) and ATP (aptATP)&#8208;are engineered to form partially&#8208;hybridized duplexes (aptDual) that can efficiently anchor to cell surface before transfer. Backpacked aptDual spatial&#8208;temporally co&#8208;localize with ACT cells in vivo and jointly infiltrate the ATP&#8208;rich TME. Upon binding with ATP, aptDual dissociates to responsively release aptPD&#8208;L1. Concurrently, aptATP scavenges extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine to disrupt the inhibitory adenosinergic axis, thereby sensitizing ACT cells to immune checkpoint blockade by aptPD&#8208;L1. This dual inhibition elicited a remarkable 40&#8208;fold increase in functional tumor&#8208;infiltrating ACT cells, substantially boosting the efficacy of TCR&#8208;T and CAR&#8208;T cells in multiple solid tumor models, even in immunologically &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors. NAT backpacks provide a facile, versatile, and safe strategy to augment various ACTs against solid tumors.

         <title>A Durable and Highly Active Oxygen Electrode for Solid Oxide Cells: New Insight into Segregation Suppression of Layered Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High entropy oxides (HEOs) have attracted significant attention in the field of Solid oxide cells (SOCs) owing to their outstanding advantages. However, there is a lack of studies on mechanism through which entropy increases in HEO oxygen electrodes affects segregation suppression. Based on PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF), a novel (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode is designed and fabricated in this work to claim the mechanism of entropy&#8208;enhanced in layered perovskite.








Abstract
One challenge to realize the commercialization of solid oxide cell technology is the instability and poor catalytic activity of the oxygen electrode during stack operation caused by Cr&#8208;containing alloy interconnect. Particularly well&#8208;known Sr/Ba&#8208;containing perovskite oxides can easily segregate Sr/Ba to the surface, reacting with vaporized Cr and causing Cr poisoning. To address this challenge, this work designs an entropy&#8208;driven layered structural strategy to suppress the surface segregation of cations and realize substantial enhancement of catalysis activity and Cr tolerance. The investigations suggest that the planar strain generated by entropy increase in the rare earth layer plays a pivotal role in suppressing alkaline earth segregation. Consequently, the half&#8208;cells with (La0.25Pr0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)Ba0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (LPNSBSCF) oxygen electrode exhibit significantly improved stability in various operation conditions with Cr containment. Furthermore, LPNSBSCF shows the high power density of 2.12 W cm&#8722;2 at 800&#160;&#176;C and 1.41 W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C in the single cells of oxygen ion and proton type, respectively. This paper provides new insights into segregation suppression in layered perovskite and offers theoretical guidance for the rational design of oxygen electrodes to achieve high Cr&#8208;tolerance and catalytic activity.

         <title>CO2 Laser&#8208;Stabilized Ni&#8208;Co Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Sites for Energy Generation and Ammonia Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid, scalable CO2&#8208;laser irradiation method is reported to anchor Ni and Co as dual single atoms on L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx MXene (DSAC). The resulting DSAC enables efficient NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208; NH3 conversion in a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; battery, achieving simultaneous nitrate removal, energy generation, and ammonia synthesis via a potential&#8208;resolved reaction pathway.








Abstract
Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DSACs) hold immense potential in electrochemical nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction (EcNR) as a sustainable replacement to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for the production of ammonia (NH3). However, challenges such as synthesis complexity, low purity, scalability, and stability have hindered their practical application. Herein, a rapid and scalable method is introduced to stabilize low&#8208;cost 3d transition metals (Ni and Co) as DSACs on Ti3C2Tx MXene in 10&#160;min using continuous&#8208;wave CO2&#8208;laser irradiation. Ni2+ and Co2+ ions are chelated and stabilized as single atoms onto an L&#8208;tryptophan&#8208;modified Ti3C2Tx surface via metal&#9472;O and metal&#9472;N bonds, forming Ni&#8208;single atom catalyst (SAC)/MXene, Co&#8208;SAC/MXene, and NiCo&#8208;DSAC/MXene. This approach enhances MXene properties, enabling the synthesis of efficient atomic&#8208;level electrocatalysts. Potential&#8208;resolved in situ Raman spectroelectrochemistry and density functional theory reveal that EcNR proceeds through NO3&#8722; reduction to *NO2, *NO, *NH, and *NH2 intermediates, ultimately forming NH3 via final protonation step. This process exhibits a low limiting potential of &#8722;0.37&#160;V, with *NO2 protonation identified as the critical step. NiCo&#8208;DSAC/MXene exhibited superior EcNR performance for NH3 production in 1.0&#160;M potassium hydroxide with sustained multiple cyclic stability. Furthermore, this catalyst is integrated into a Zn&#8211;NO3&#8722; a battery that simultaneously removes NO3&#8722;, generates energy, and synthesizes NH3.

         <title>Detecting Cr6+ at &#8776;100 pM Concentration with Fluorescence Enhancement Signatures in a Novel Eco&#8208;Fluorophore: Matching WHO's 96 pM Recommended Standard for Drinking Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a dual&#8208;functionalization strategy, carbon quantum dots (CQD) with exceptional fluorescence properties are engineered. These CQD are integrated with graphitic carbon nitride to form a 2D/2D heterostructure via both covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification. This integration enables ultra&#8208;trace Cr&#8310;&#8314; detection with a limit of detection &#8776;70 pM&#8212;surpassing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cr&#8310;&#8314; sensors.








Abstract
Hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) ions in drinking water pose a significant risk to human health, being a leading cause for neurological disorders, organ damage, and infertility. This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr6+ over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non&#8208;covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual&#8208;functionalized CQD (CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH)) derived from coffee&#8208;waste. Additionally, the covalent and non&#8208;covalent approach integrates CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD&#8208;(NH2, COOH) and g&#8208;C3N4 introduces a mid&#8208;gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr6+ detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr6+ in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non&#8208;covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide&#8208;range fluorescent sensing applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hexavalent chromium (Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in drinking water pose a significant risk to human health, being a leading cause for neurological disorders, organ damage, and infertility. This study introduces an ultrasensitive method for detecting trace Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; over a wide concentration range (&#8776; 100 pM &#8211; 100&#160;&#181;M) through fluorescence enhancement signatures via integration of both covalent and non-covalent interaction strategies on carbon quantum dots (CQD). The covalent functionalization is achieved from dual-functionalized CQD (CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH)) derived from coffee-waste. Additionally, the covalent and non-covalent approach integrates CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH) with graphitic carbon nitride (g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) to form a 2D/2D heterostructure. The synergy between CQD-(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, COOH) and g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; introduces a mid-gap band in their band structure, allowing multiple carrier excitation and recombination states, significantly&#160;enhancing the fluorescence quenching signal. This combination allows to achieve Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; detection sensitivity down to &#8776;100 pM concentration&#8212;matching the World Health Organization's 96 pM permissible limit of total Cr in drinking water. Furthermore, a 70 pM detection limit is reported for Cr&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; in a mixture of twelve ions, including cations and anions, surpassing current state-of-the-art detection limits. These results highlight the potential of dual covalent and non-covalent modification strategy in nanomaterials to set new standards in ultrasensitive and wide-range fluorescent sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of Magnetic Domain and the Occurrence of Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in the Folded van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology is demonstrated that leverages the flexible nature of van der Waals ferromagnet, specifically employing an origami technique to modulate magnetic domains. A previously rarely observed antisymmetric magnetoresistance effect is detected in folded vdW Fe3GaTe2 devices. The results highlight the potential for fabricating novel spintronic devices based on this origami&#8208;like domain structure engineering method.








Abstract
Emergent magnetism in 2D materials has attracted significant attention due to their intrinsic magnetic order, which persists down to the monolayer limit, and their potential applications in spintronic devices. In particular, domain structure modulation plays a crucial role in 2D magnet&#8208;based nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, the fabrication and modulation of the desired domain structure, along with the establishment of reliable electrical write/read operations, remain significant challenges. Herein, a unique structure&#8208;shaping way to modulate domain structure is demonstrated via folding a continuous flat Fe3GaTe2 nanosheet. Accompanied by magnetic domain structure transformation, the symmetric butterfly&#8208;shaped magnetoresistance (MR) curve changes to an antisymmetric field&#8208;dependent magnetoresistance. Notably, the MR exhibits either the same or opposite sign at geometrically equivalent positions, depending on the relative angle of the current flow and domain wall direction. The MR behavior with respect to sweeping field and electrodes position is due to the circulating current in the vicinity of the domain wall. More importantly, this new concept of manipulating domain structure and its associated magneto&#8208;transport behavior can inspire novel spintronic devices fabrication and application.

         <title>Constructing Water&#8208;Retaining/Ion&#8208;Regulating Bi&#8208;Layers for Highly Durable, All&#8208;Climate, Efficient Moisture Electric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance moisture&#8208;electric generator is fabricated by integrating an ionic hydrogel layer with a graphene oxide film, where the designed ionic hydrogel offers ongoing power output under diverse environments while the intrinsic layering graphene oxide efficiently manages ion diffusion for enhanced electricity production. The developed device can be easily scaled up for powering various electronic devices.








Abstract
Moisture electric generators (MEGs), which can directly convert chemical energy in moisture into electricity have demonstrated great potential for powering wearable electronics and IoT devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MEGs suffer from transient power output and rely on high relative humidity (RH) as well as mild temperature, hampering their practical applications. Herein, a novel high&#8208;performance MEG is reported by designing ionic hydrogel and graphene oxide dual&#8208;layered devices, where the water&#8208;enriched hydrogel enables continuous power outputs under various conditions while the inherent layering nanochannels effectively regulate ion diffusion for stable and efficient performance improvement. The MEG can generate a maximum power density of 71.7&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 and continuously output 0.6&#160;V for more than 1400&#160;h at room condition without degradation. Most importantly, the developed generator can operate well from &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C to 50&#160;&#176;C, and an ultrahigh and stable voltage of 1.2&#160;V is realized at RH of 0% owing to the dynamic water equilibrium in the system. The MEG also displays excellent self&#8208;restoration capabilities, demonstrating high cyclic&#8208;performing potential. This work may provide important guidelines in designing long&#8208;life all climate applicable energy harvesting devices through designing synergistic bilayers architecture.

         <title>Toward the Ideal Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalyst: a Noble Metal&#8208;Free Antiperovskite Optimized with A&#8208;Site Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is for the first time reported to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance, benefiting from the inherent metallic characteristics and unique multifunction&#8208;site synergy whereby Ni sites facilitate the H2O dissociation/OH&#8722; desorption and Cd&#8211;Ni bridge sites are active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution.








Abstract
To achieve the ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal HER electrocatalyst in alkaline media, developing conductive systems with multiple active sites targeting every elementary step in the alkaline HER, is highly desirable but remains a great challenge. Herein, a conductive noble metal&#8208;free antiperovskite CdNNi3 is reported with intrinsic metallic characteristics as a highly efficient alkaline HER electrocatalyst, which is designed by the facile A&#8208;site tuning strategy with the modulation the electronic structures and interfacial water configurations of antiperovskites. Impressively, the HER performance of CdNNi3 antiperovskite is superior to various state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;noble metal catalysts ever reported, and also outperforms the commercial Raney Ni catalyst when assemble as the cathode in the practical anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) device. With insights from comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the CdNNi3 can create synergistic dual active sites for catalyzing different elementary steps of the alkaline HER; namely, the Ni site can effectively facilitate the H2O dissociation and OH&#8722; desorption, while the unusual Cd&#8211;Ni bridge site is active for the optimal H* adsorption and H2 evolution. Such multifunction&#8208;site synergy, together with inherent high electrical conductivity, enables the CdNNi3 antiperovskite to fulfill the essential criteria for an ideal non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal alkaline HER electrocatalyst with excellent performance.

         <title>Orbital Topology of Chiral Crystals for Orbitronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and constitutional for life. In chiral materials the intrinsic handedness, defined by their crystal structure, becomes a main driver for a novel electronic topology that is based on the orbital angular momentum rather than the electron spin. The pivotal role of the orbital angular momentum makes chiral materials an ideal candidate for orbitronics applications.








Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and manifests in a wide range of phenomena including chemical reactions, biological processes, and quantum transport of electrons. In quantum materials, the chirality of fermions, given by the relative directions between the electron spin and momentum, is connected to the band topology of electronic states. This study shows that in structurally chiral materials like CoSi, the orbital angular momentum (OAM) serves as the main driver of a nontrivial band topology in this new class of unconventional topological semimetals, even when spin&#8208;orbit coupling is negligible. A nontrivial orbital&#8208;momentum locking of multifold chiral fermions in the bulk leads to a pronounced OAM texture of the helicoid Fermi arcs at the surface. The study highlights the pivotal role of the orbital degree of freedom for the chirality and topology of electron states, in general, and paves the way towards the application of topological chiral semimetals in orbitronic&#160;devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an ultrathin solid electrolyte inspired by reinforced concrete is developed, which integrates a nanostructured ceramic conductor and crosslinked polymer chains to induce a rapid multidimensional lithium&#8208;ion transport network. The synergistic ceramic&#8208;polymer framework uniformly stabilizes the structure, enabling dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and excellent interfacial stability. The optimized unique ion migration hopping mechanism facilitates the rapid transport of lithium&#8208;ion within the electrolyte, resulting in both stable and fast charging/discharging performance.








Abstract
Realizing solid&#8208;state lithium (Li) metal batteries with fast charging capability and desirable energy density remains a key challenge for emerging applications for drones and consumer electronics, which require solid electrolytes to maintain good ionic conductivity and mechanical integrity with fast reaction kinetics. Herein, an 8.4&#160;&#181;m ultrathin solid electrolyte membrane is manifested with a reinforced concrete structure and expedited ion hopping migration capability, enabling the solid&#8208;state battery with fast charging capability. The rapid multi&#8208;dimensional Li&#8208;ion transportation network is well&#8208;constructed based on nanosized ceramic conductor aggregation and polymer chain induction, which allows homogenized Li+ distribution on the interface with a continuous uniform and steady plating/stripping process, thereby enhancing interfacial stability and inhibiting dendrite growth. Attributed to its structural superiorities, the assembled solid&#8208;state lithium metal battery maintains an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.2% after 1300 cycles at 10 C. A 1.2 Ah pouch cell is fabricated with a high energy density of 415.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and also capable of cycling at 5 C, showing great potential for the practical application of solid&#8208;state batteries for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>Spatiotemporally Programming Microenvironment to Recapitulate Endochondral Ossification via Greenhouse&#8208;Inspired Bionic Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, this study develops a bionic niche capable of spatiotemporal programming the microenvironment to recapitulate the process of endochondral ossification (ECO). The niche successfully orchestrates the key stages of ECO, including immunomodulation, revascularization, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis, offering a promising strategy for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials in bone tissue engineering.








Abstract
Various biomaterials have been developed to address challenging critical&#8208;sized bone defects. However, most of them focus on intramembranous ossification (IMO) rather than endochondral ossification (ECO), often resulting in suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. Drawing inspiration from the functionality of the greenhouse ecosystem, herein a bionic niche is innovatively crafted to recapitulate the ECO process. This niche consists of three hierarchical components: an embedded microchannel network that facilitates cell infiltration and matter exchange, a polydopamine surface modification layer with immunomodulatory functions, and an ECO&#8208;targeted delivery system based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Through spatiotemporally programming of the microenvironment, the bionic niche effectively recapitulates the key stages of ECO. Notably, even in the rat calvaria, a region well&#8208;known for IMO, the bionic niche is capable of initiating ECO, evident by cartilage template formation, leading to efficient bone regeneration. Taken together, this study introduces prospective concepts for designing next&#8208;generation ECO&#8208;driven biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

The unique architecture integrates the advantages of amorphous and crystalline phases, resulting in exceptional electrochemical performance, including a remarkable specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, and 100% Coulombic efficiency.








Abstract
Transition metal sulfur oxides have emerged as promising candidates for advanced energy storage due to their multi&#8208;electron redox activity and tunable nanostructures. Among them, Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S composites are particularly attractive for supercapacitors owing to their high energy storage density. However, conventional synthesis methods often require prolonged processing times (&gt;10&#160;h) or high&#8208;temperature treatments (&gt;80&#160;&#176;C), which limit their practical applications. This work addresses these challenges by developing amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline intertwined Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;O&#8208;S nanohybrid nanosheet arrays through a rapid alternating current (AC) electrodeposition method (1&#160;h) under ambient conditions. The unique architecture combines the advantages of amorphous phases (enhanced ion diffusion pathways) and nanocrystalline domains (efficient charge transport), leading to exceptional specific capacitance of 4804&#160;F&#160;g&#8315;&#185; (or 959&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, 2402&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1) at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;, 82.2% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles (5&#160;A&#160;g&#8315;&#185;), and a near 100% Coulombic efficiency (CE). The assembled asymmetric supercapacitor achieves an energy density of 199.4&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8315;&#185; at 754&#160;W&#160;kg&#8315;&#185;, bridging the performance gap between batteries and conventional capacitors.

         <title>Synchronization Strategy for Activity and Stability in Fenton&#8208;Like Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. In addition, the auxiliary role of machine learning is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. Key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts with high efficiency and long&#8208;term durability for practical environmental remediation.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered significant attention in the applications of environmental remediation based on Fenton&#8208;like systems. Current research on Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis often emphasizes catalytic activity and mechanism regulation, while paying limited attention to the simultaneous enhancement of both activity and stability&#8212;a critical factor for the practical and scale&#8208;up applications of SACs. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive review of Fenton&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysis from the perspective of concurrent optimization of activity and stability. Additionally, the auxiliary role of machine learning and lifecycle assessment (LCA) is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. By investigating the interplay among different support materials, coordination configurations, and reaction environments, as well as enlarged modules, key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next&#8208;generation catalysts with high efficiency and long&#8208;term durability for practical environmental remediation.

Current research on Fenton-like single-atom catalysis often emphasizes catalytic activity and mechanism regulation, while paying limited attention to the simultaneous enhancement of both activity and stability&#8212;a critical factor for the practical and scale-up applications of SACs. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in synchronization strategies for improving the activity and stability of Fenton-like single-atom catalysis, with a focus on the design principles and mechanisms of four key strategies: coordination engineering, confinement effects, carrier substitution, and catalytic module design. To the best of knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive review of Fenton-like single-atom catalysis from the perspective of concurrent optimization of activity and stability. Additionally, the auxiliary role of machine learning and lifecycle assessment (LCA) is evaluated in advancing these synchronization strategies. By investigating the interplay among different support materials, coordination configurations, and reaction environments, as well as enlarged modules, key factors governing the stability/activity of SACs are highlighted, and future directions are proposed for developing next-generation catalysts with high efficiency and long-term durability for practical environmental remediation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>When Graphitic Nitrogen Meets Pentagons: Selective Construction and Spectroscopic Evidence for Improved Four&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exclusive construction of graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is achieved by pyrolysis of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 under unusually high temperatures. The graphitic nitrogen model electrocatalyst enables highly efficient four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in both alkaline and acidic conditions, as evidenced by in situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon materials have emerged as promising metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, the structural inhomogeneity, particularly the coexistence of four nitrogen doping structures&#8211;pyridinic, graphitic, pyrrolic, and oxidized nitrogen&#8211;makes assessing their respective contributions challenging and controversial. The current understanding of the four nitrogen doping structures may be also oversimplified and even problematic. The development of a distinctive graphitic&#8208;N&#8208;doped carbon electrocatalyst is presented in which graphitic nitrogen coordinated with pentagon defects is selectively constructed. Contrary to the previously held belief that graphitic nitrogen has little effect on ORR electrocatalysis, the unique graphitic N configuration exhibited significantly enhanced four&#8208;electron ORR activity in both alkaline and acidic media. In situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy combined with density functional theory calculations further revealed that graphitic nitrogen, when coordinated with pentagon defects, optimized the density of states near the Fermi level, leading to optimized binding energies with oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. The results rationalize the long&#8208;standing controversy over the role of different nitrogen dopants in ORR electrocatalysis and suggest that there is considerable potential to precisely construct new nitrogen doping configurations to achieve superior electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>In Situ Polymerized Polyfluorinated Crosslinked Polyether Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolytes are engineered for high&#8208;voltage Li metal batteries. Electron&#8208;withdrawing fluorinated groups enhance oxidative stability, improve interfacial compatibility, and promote inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase formation for uniform Li deposition. Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells achieve&#160;401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 specific energy, showcasing promise for practical high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.








Abstract
In situ polymerized polyether electrolytes are promising for solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries due to their high ionic conductivity and excellent interfacial contact. However, their practical application is hindered by Li dendrite formation, interfacial degradation, and limited oxidative stability. Herein, we propose an in situ polymerized polyfluorinated crosslinked polyether electrolyte (PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO), synthesized by copolymerizing 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) with 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5&#8208;octafluorohexane&#8208;1,6&#8208;diyl)bis(oxirane) (OFHDBO) as a polyfluorinated crosslinker. The electron&#8208;withdrawing polyfluorinated groups endow PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO with enhanced oxidative stability and interfacial compatibility, while reducing the solvation power of the polymer matrix to promote an anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase for uniform Li deposition. Consequently, PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO exhibits a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;5.6&#160;V) and enables long&#8208;term stable Li plating/stripping for over 1100&#160;h. Furthermore, Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) full cells utilizing PDOL&#8208;OFHDBO demonstrate outstanding cycling stability with high&#8208;loading cathodes (&#8776;3.8 mAh cm&#8722;2) and thin Li anodes (50&#160;&#181;m), achieving capacity retention of 95.5% and 89.1% over 100 cycles at cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.3 and 4.5&#160;V, respectively. Remarkably, Ah&#8208;level Li||NCM811 pouch cells deliver an impressive specific energy of 401.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, highlighting their potential for practical solid&#8208;state Li metal batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Thermal Charging Cells Enabled by Ca&#8211;Li Dual&#8208;Cationic Ionic Liquid Electrolytes and Anionophilic Separators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells, incorporating heat&#8208;resistant Ca&#8211;Li salt, C4mimAOT&#8208;AmimCl co&#8208;solvent, and PEN@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% separators, are successfully developed. These advancements are attributed to enhanced energy storage of dual carriers, improved diffusion kinetics facilitated by the AmimCl solvent and optimized carrier mobility enabled by the anionophilic properties of ZrBDC. The research holds significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.








Abstract
Thermoelectric technologies (TEs) offer immense potential for waste heat recovery and energy storage. However, the practical application of current TEs has been severely hampered by potential performance degradation in extreme environments, particularly at high temperatures, due to electrolyte flammability or poor carrier mobility. The development of high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance TEs is crucial for broadening their operational range and enabling diverse applications. Here, practical high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;voltage thermal charging cells (HHTCCs) are reported, facilitated by a heat&#8208;resistant trifluoromethanesulfonate&#8208;based Ca&#8211;Li dual&#8208;cationic ionic liquid electrolyte containing functionalized AmimCl solvent, together with a thermotolerant composite membrane, PEN(polyphenylene&#8208;ether&#8208;nitrile)@ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4%. The dual&#8208;cation mechanism enables high thermal voltage through cooperative energy storage, while the functionalized AmimCl accelerates the mobility of Ca2+ and Li+ ions by weakening the surrounding shielding effect. Additionally, the anionophilic ZrBDC&#8208;F&#8208;4% nanoparticles in the composite membrane enhance carrier migration. As a result, the HHTCCs exhibit an impressive thermal voltage of 1.138 V, a remarkable thermopower of 15.3 mV K&#8722;1, and an outstanding Carnot&#8208;relative efficiency of 9.56% over an unprecedented temperature range from 328.15 to 393.15 K, demonstrating the excellent safety and feasibility of HHTCCs. This work expands the service&#8208;temperature range of i&#8208;TEs, holding significant promise for high&#8208;temperature, high&#8208;performance waste heat harvesting.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Unlocking Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Performance with Porous PtCoV Alloy Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact Pt&#8208;ionomer microenvironment is strategically engineered to alleviate the sulfonate group&#8208;induced poisoning effect on Pt active sites by encapsulating Pt&#8208;based nanoalloys within porous nanofibers. This innovative architecture significantly enhanced proton exchange membrane fuel cell performance, achieving a remarkable peak power density of 29.0 kW gPt&#8722;1 and an exceptional initial mass activity of 0.69 A mgPt&#8722;1.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported Pt&#8208;based catalysts in fuel cells often suffer from sulfonate poisoning, reducing Pt utilization and activity. Herein, a straightforward strategy is developed for synthesizing a porous PtCoV nanoalloy embedded within the porous structures of carbon nanofibers. Incorporation of vanadium (V) atoms into the PtCo alloy optimizes the oxygen binding energy of Pt sites, while heightening the dissolution energy barrier for both Pt and Co atoms, leading to a significantly enhanced intrinsic activity and durability of the catalyst. By encapsulating the nanoalloys within porous nanofibers, a non&#8208;contact Pt&#8208;ionomer interface is created to mitigate the poisoning effect of sulfonate groups to Pt sites, while promoting oxygen permeation and allowing proton transfer. This rational architecture liberates additional active Pt sites, while the evolved porous nanostructure of the PtCoV alloy extends its exposed surface area, thereby boosting Pt utilization within the catalytic layer and overall fuel cell performance. The optimized catalyst demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 29.0 kW gPt&#8722;1 and an initial mass activity of 0.69 A mgPt&#8722;1, which exceeds&#160;the U.S. Department of Energy 2025 targets. This study provides a promising avenue for developing highly active and durable low&#8208;Pt electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications.

         <title>Creation of Independently Controllable and Long Lifetime Polar Skyrmion Textures in Ferroelectric&#8208;Metallic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates that PTO/CCMO/SRO heterostructure can hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like polar textures. One can write regular skyrmion bubble patterns with a high density &#8776;300 Gbit per inch2 by local tip field. The multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show significant topology&#8208;enhanced stability, verifying a topology strategy to encode robust information in ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Topological textures like vortices, labyrinths, and skyrmions formed in ferroic materials have attracted extensive interest during the past decade for their fundamental physics, intriguing topology, and technological prospects. So far, polar skyrmions remain scarce in ferroelectrics as they require a delicate balance between various dipolar interactions. Here, it is reported that PbTiO3 thin films in a metallic contact undergo a topological phase transition and hold a broad family of skyrmion&#8208;like textures including Q = &#177;1 skyrmions, multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions, and skyrmion bags, with independent controllability, analogous to those reported in magnetic systems. Weakly&#8208;interacted skyrmion arrays with a density over 300 Gbit/inch2 are successfully written, erased, and read out by local electrical and mechanical stimuli of a scanning probe. Interestingly, in contrast to the relatively short lifetime (&lt;20 hours) of the normal skyrmions, the multiple &#960;&#8208;twist target skyrmions and skyrmion bags show topology&#8208;enhanced stability with a lifetime of over two weeks. Experimental and theoretical analysis implies the heterostructures carry electric Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction mediated by oxygen octahedral tiltings. The results demonstrate ferroelectric&#8208;metallic heterostructures as fertile playgrounds for topological states and emergent phenomena.

         <title>Enhanced Polariton Interactions in Suspended WS2 Monolayer Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayers of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides exhibit strong exciton resonances for light&#8208;matter interactions at RT, though substrate effects limit performance. This work presents a planar microcavity with a suspended WS2 monolayer, eliminating substrate&#8208;induced losses. The system shows enhancement of strong coupling and preserves the spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions, achieving a record exciton interaction constant close to theoretical predictions. This approach reveals the intrinsic optical and spintronic properties of 2D materials, paving the way for advanced polaritonic.








Abstract
Transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides monolayers exhibit strong exciton resonances that enable intense light&#8208;matter interactions. The sensitivity of these materials to the surrounding environment and their interactions with the substrate result in the enhancement of excitonic losses through scattering, dissociation and defects formation, hindering their full potential for the excitation of optical nonlinearities in exciton&#8208;polariton platforms. The use of suspended monolayers holds the potential to completely eliminate substrate&#8208;induced losses, offering unique advantages for the exploitation of intrinsic electronic, mechanical, and optical properties of 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems, without any influence of proximity effects. In this work, we report a novel fabrication approach enabling the realization of a planar microcavity filled with a suspended tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer in its center. We experimentally demonstrate a 2&#8208;fold enhancement of the strong coupling at room temperature, due to the larger exciton binding energy and reduced overall losses as compared to similar systems based on dielectric&#8208;filled microcavities. As a result, spin&#8208;dependent polaritonic interactions are significantly amplified, leading to achievement of a record exciton interaction constant approaching the theoretically predicted value. This approach holds promises for pushing 2D materials&#8208;based polaritonic systems to their intrinsic limits, paving the way for the realization of novel polaritonic devices with superior performance.

         <title>Harnessing Spin&#8208;Lattice Interplay in Metal Nitrides for Efficient Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of Mo triggers a high&#8208;spin to low&#8208;spin transition in Co centers, achieving efficient nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion. This spin&#8208;engineered catalytic system establishes a transformative platform for sustainable energy technologies, advancing frontier applications in electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Metal nitrides, renowned for their spin&#8208;lattice&#8208;charge interplay, offer vast potential in catalysis, electronics, and energy conversion. However, spin polarization manipulation in these nitrides remains a challenge for multi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic processes. This study introduces Co3Mo3N with a low&#8208;spin polarization configuration, achieved by incorporating spin&#8208;free lattice Mo with 4d orbitals into high&#8208;spin polarization Co4N. This innovation delivers outstanding nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia electrosynthesis, ranking among the best to date. Mo inclusion induces competing magnetic exchange interactions, reducing the spin polarization degree and enabling rate&#8208;determining step of NO2* to NO&#8208;OH* conversion via vertex&#8208;sharing NMo6 octahedra. A paired electro&#8208;refinery with a Co3Mo3N cathode achieves 2&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 2.28&#160;V and sustains an industrial&#8208;scale current of 1&#8201;000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for 2,100&#160;h, with an NH3 production rate of &#8776;70&#160;mg NH3&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a transformative platform for spin polarization degree&#8208;engineered electrocatalysts, driving breakthroughs in energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Emergent Locomotion in Self&#8208;Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Ringsf</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally fueled, self&#8208;moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.








Abstract
In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non&#8208;equilibrium states to drive self&#8208;assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non&#8208;equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self&#8208;sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero&#8208;elastic&#8208;energy&#8208;mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single&#8208;ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (N = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when N &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.

     alt="Emergent Locomotion in Self-Sustained, Mechanically Connected Soft Matter Ringsf"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermally fueled, self-moving twisted rings made from liquid crystal elastomers are investigated. By studying single rings and linked knots, it is shown how autonomous locomotion emerges through coupling between the rings. The movement is programmable via handedness control at connection points, offering insights into collective behavior and programmable motion in soft materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, the interplay between individual organisms often leads to the emergence of complex belabours, of which sophistication has been refined through millions of years of evolution. Synthetic materials research has focused on mimicking the natural complexity, e.g., by harnessing non-equilibrium states to drive self-assembly processes. However, it is highly challenging to understand the interaction dynamics between non-equilibrium entities and to obtain collective behavior that can arise autonomously through interaction. In this study, thermally fueled, twisted rings exhibiting self-sustained movements are used as fundamental units and their interactive behaviors and emergent functions are investigated. The rings are fabricated from connected thermoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) strips that undergo zero-elastic-energy-mode, autonomous motions upon a heat gradient. Single-ring structures with various twisting numbers and nontrivial links, and connected knots where several LCE rings (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 2,3,4,5) are studied and linked. The observations uncover that controlled locomotion of the structures can emerge when &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; &#8805; 3. The locomotion can be programmed by controlling the handedness at the connection points between the individual rings. These findings illustrate how group activity emerges from individual responsive material components through mechanical coupling, offering a model for programming autonomous locomotion in soft matter constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anti&#8208;Sintering Ni&#8208;W Catalytic Layer on Reductive Tungsten Carbides for Superior High&#8208;Temperature CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;sintering catalyst with efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) with stabilized Ni&#948;+ sites for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Here the concept of design of high&#8208;performance catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects offers a promising path to engineering superior high&#8208;temperature thermal catalysis.








Abstract
The reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction stands out as a promising approach for selectively converting CO2 into CO, which can then be upgraded into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. While designing high selectivity and stability catalysts for RWGS reaction remains a significant challenge. In this study, an efficient and ultra&#8208;stable Ni&#8208;W catalytic layer on reductive WC (NiAWC) is designed as an anti&#8208;sintering catalyst for superior high&#8208;temperature RWGS reaction. Benefiting from the unique structures, the NiAWC catalyst exhibits exceptionally high performances with a CO production rate of 1.84 molCO&#160;gNi&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and over 95% CO selectivity, maintaining stability for 120 h at 500&#160;&#176;C. Even after 300 h of continuous testing at 600&#160;&#176;C and five aging cycles at 800&#160;&#176;C, the activity loss is only 0.34% and 0.83%, respectively. Unlike the conventional mechanism in RWGS reaction, it is demonstrated that the Ni&#8208;W limited coordination can stabilize the Ni sites and allow a pre&#8208;oxidation of Ni&#948;+ by CO, which produces an O* electronic reservoir and hinders the charge transfer from Ni to W&#8208;O, thereby avoiding the dissolution of Ni atoms. The design of new, efficient, and selective catalysts through metal&#8208;substrate synergistic effects is suggested to offer a promising path to engineering superior thermal catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Patterned Delivery of Chemical Signals From 3D&#8208;Printed Picoliter Droplet Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks have been fabricated that control gene expression in bacterial populations by releasing chemical signals with precise spatial definition and high temporal resolution. This system of effector release is widely applicable, offering diverse applications in biology and medicine.









Abstract
Synthetic cells, such as giant unilamellar vesicles, can be engineered to detect and release chemical signals to control target cell behavior. However, control over target&#8208;cell populations is limited due to poor spatial or temporal resolution and the inability of synthetic cells to deliver patterned signals. Here, 3D&#8208;printed picoliter droplet networks are described that direct gene expression in underlying bacterial populations by patterned release of a chemical signal with temporal control. Shrinkage of the droplet networks prior to use achieves spatial control over gene expression with &#8776;50 &#181;m resolution. Ways to store chemical signals in the droplet networks and to activate release at controlled points in time are also demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the spatially&#8208;controlled delivery system can regulate competition between bacteria by inducing the patterned expression of toxic bacteriocins. This system provides the groundwork for the use of picoliter droplet networks in fundamental biology and in medicine in applications that require the controlled formation of chemical gradients (i.e., for the purpose of local control of gene expression) within a target group of cells.

         <title>Zwitterionic Brush&#8208;Grafted Interfacial Bio&#8208;Lubricant Evades Complement C3&#8208;Mediated Macrophage Phagocytosis for Osteoarthritis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A macrophage&#8208;evading nano&#8208;lubricant is designed to enhance osteoarthritis (OA) treatment by suppressing complement C3 adsorption and subsequent macrophage phagocytosis. Through a zwitterionic PMPC brush layer, this strategy reduces inflammation, preserves joint lubrication, and prevents OA progression. This work highlights the pivotal role of complement C3 in nanoparticle clearance and offers a novel therapeutic approach for OA management.









Abstract
Administering a bio&#8208;lubricant is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), in particular, if it can both manage symptoms and halt disease progression. However, the clearance of these bio&#8208;lubricants mediated by synovial macrophages leads to reduced therapeutic efficiency and adverse inflammatory responses. Herein, it is shown that this process is predominantly mediated by the specific binding of complement C3 (on nanoparticle) and CD11b (on macrophage). More importantly, through a systematic evaluation of various interface modifications, a macrophage&#8208;evading nanoparticle strategy is proposed, which not only minimizes friction, but also largely suppresses C3 adsorption. It involves employing a zwitterionic poly&#8208;2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (PMPC) brush layer grafted from a crosslinked gelatin core. In vitro studies demonstrate that such a nanoparticle lubricant can evade macrophage phagocytosis and further prevent the pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 polarization and subsequent harmful release of cytokines. In vivo studies show that the designed PMPC brush layer effectively mitigates synovial inflammation, alleviates OA&#8208;associated pain, and protects cartilage from degeneration, thus preventing OA progression. These findings clarify the pivotal role of complement C3&#8208;mediated macrophage recognition in nanoparticles clearance and offer a promising nanoparticle design strategy to restore joint lubrication.

         <title>Near Infrared Light&#8208;Based Non&#8208;Contact Sensing System for Robotics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;contact intelligent sensing system that can accurately recognize patterns formed by NIR light is reported. Black phosphate (BP)&#8208;based organogel with anti&#8208;freezing and water retention properties as non&#8208;contact sensor can be used in extremely cold or hot environments. The designed non&#8208;contact sensing system shows good robustness by maintaining high sensitivity over a wide temperature range, long working distances, different current intensities, and dark conditions.








Abstract
With the development of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, non&#8208;contact sensors are expected to realize complex human&#8208;computer interaction. However, current non&#8208;contact sensors are mainly limited by accuracy and stability. Herein, an intelligent infrared photothermal non&#8208;contact sensing system is developed that provides long&#8208;distance and high&#8208;accuracy non&#8208;contact sensing. A black phosphorus (BP)&#8208;based composite organogel is designed, which exhibits excellent photothermal properties and environmental stability, as the active material. This material can detect patterns created by near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light through various patterned masks monitored by an infrared thermal imager. The constructed non&#8208;contact sensing system is capable of accurately recognizing 26 letters with an impressive accuracy rate of 99.4%. Furthermore, even small size non&#8208;contact sensors can maintain high sensitivity and stability across a wide temperature range, at long working distances, and under different current intensities and dark conditions, demonstrating exceptional robustness. Combined with machine learning method, it is demonstrated that the non&#8208;contact sensing system excels in pattern recognition and human&#8208;computer interaction. These features highlight its potential applications in intelligent robotics and remote control systems.

Abstract
High&#8208;energy radiation is widely used in medicine, industry, and scientific research. Meanwhile, the detection of environmental ionizing radiation is essential to ensure the safe use of high&#8208;energy radiation. Among radiation detectors, scintillator detectors offer multiple advantages, including simple structure, high sensitivity, excellent environmental adaptability, and a favorable performance&#8208;to&#8208;price ratio. However, the development of high&#8208;performance scintillators that can provide highly sensitive responses to environmental radiation, especially &#945;/&#946; particles, remains a challenge. In this work, a copper cluster (Cu4I4(DPPPy)2) with excellent water&#8208;oxygen stability is prepared using a simple one&#8208;pot method at room temperature. Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 not only exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray excited luminescence (XEL) under X&#8208;ray irradiation but also demonstrates a highly sensitive scintillation response to &#945;/&#946; particles. By integrating Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) and nuclear electronics, an &#945;/&#946; surface contamination monitor is successfully developed. This monitor enables the sensitive detection of excessive &#945;/&#946; particles in real&#8208;world environments. The detection frequency and signal intensity of Cu4I4(DPPPy)2 significantly surpass those of commercial scintillator of YAP:Ce, BGO, PbWO4, and anthracene under identical conditions, highlighting the promising application of metal clusters in low&#8208;dose environmental radiation detection.

         <title>Mechanical Resonant Sensing of Spin Texture Dynamics in a 2D Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Detection of antiferromagnetic spin texture in a 2D magnetic crystal is achieved through nanomechanical resonators at radio frequencies. Sharp magnetic transitions that lead to abrupt changes in mechanical linear and nonlinear responses are assigned to antiferromagnetic domain motions. The results indicate rich and fluid&#8208;like dynamics between the coupled spin and lattice at the transition field.








Abstract
The coupling between the spin degrees of freedom and macroscopic mechanical motions, including striction, shearing, and rotation, has attracted wide interest with applications in actuation, transduction, and information processing. Experiments so far have established the mechanical responses to the long&#8208;range ordered or isolated single spin states. However, it remains elusive whether mechanical motions can couple to a different type of magnetic structure, the non&#8208;collinear spin textures, which exhibit nanoscale spatial variations of spin (domain walls, skyrmions, etc.) and are promising candidates to realize high&#8208;speed computing devices. Here, collective spin texture dynamics is detected with nanoelectromechanical resonators fabricated from&#160;2D antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnPS3 with 10&#8722;9 strain sensitivity. By examining radio frequency mechanical oscillations under magnetic fields, new magnetic transitions are identified with sharp dips in resonant frequency. They are attributed to collective AFM domain wall motions as supported by the analytical modeling of magnetostriction and large&#8208;scale spin&#8208;dynamics simulations. Additionally, an abnormally large modulation in the mechanical nonlinearity at the transition field infers a fluid&#8208;like response due to ultrafast domain motion. The work establishes a strong coupling between spin texture and mechanical dynamics, laying the foundation for electromechanical manipulation of spin texture and developing quantum hybrid devices.

         <title>Decoupling Lithium Reutilization Behavior under Different Discharge Rates for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers the Li0 reutilization behavior of AFLMBs at different discharge rates, which exhibits a &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; variation. The opposite effects of the distribution relationship between fresh Li and residue Li0 and concentration polarization at specific discharge rate dominate Li0 reutilization. This cognition provides guidance toward high&#8208;power density AFLMBs under practical conditions.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal battery (AFLMB) has become an excellent candidate for long endurance electric vehicles and electric low altitude aircraft, profiting from its high energy density as well as outstanding manufacturing safety. However, the limitation at high discharge rates of AFLMBs is shrouded in mystery, yet to achieve more attention. Herein, the limitation of fast discharge for AFLMBs is dissected exhaustively, and a symptomatic strategy to break the limit is put forward, in order to eliminate the inevitable mismatch that lies in the inferior performance of AFLMBs. A &#8220;volcano&#8208;type&#8221; curve of capacity retention of AFLMBs is discovered with the discharge rate increased. Systematic investigation revealed that the overlapped spatial relationship between fresh deposited Li and residue Li0 facilitated the utilization of &#8220;recoverable Li0&#8221; (Li0) at the prophase of discharge rate increase. However, further enhanced discharge rate induced large concentration polarization (&#951;conc), reflecting limited Li+ diffusion. Enabling the electrolyte to rapidly transport Li+ by lowering &#951;conc increased the optimal discharge rate as well as the cycling stability of AFLMBs. This work reveals the rate&#8208;determining step for high&#8208;rate discharge and expands the employment boundary of AFLMBs under harsh conditions, providing a significant complement of present knowledge with respect to the power performance of AFLMBs.

         <title>Thermo&#8208;Electric&#8208;Mechanical Coupling Selects Barrier Layer for Advanced Bismuth Telluride Thermoelectric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thermo&#8208;electric&#8208;mechanical coupling strategy proposed here predicts the feasibility of Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, based on three&#8208;phase thermodynamic equilibrium, electrical resistivity, and CTE compatibility. The fabricated TE generators demonstrate a third&#8208;party&#8208;verified conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 when the hot&#8208;side temperature is 523 K, with negligible degradation over 200 h.








Abstract
The long&#8208;term stability of thermoelectric generators, including those based on Bi2Te3, is hindered by the lack of ideal thermoelectric barrier materials (TEbMs). Conventional selection methods for TEbMs mainly rely on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error, which is time&#8208;consuming and does not reveal the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a new design principle for selecting TEbMs based on thermo&#8211;electric&#8211;mechanical coupling is proposed. By combining the phase diagram predictions with the thermal expansion coefficients and electrical resistivities of the potential reactants, the Ni2SbTe2 and NiTe2 compounds are identified as ideal TEbMs for (Bi,Sb)2Te3 and Bi2(Te,Se)3, respectively, leading to interfaces with high thermal stability, low contact resistivity, and high strength. The fabricated thermoelectric generator achieves a competitive conversion efficiency of 7.1% and a power density of 0.49 W cm&#8722;2 at hot&#8208;side and cold&#8208;side temperatures of 523 and 296 K, respectively. Moreover, performance degradation is negligible after 200&#160;h of cycling. This work demonstrates progress toward stable high&#8208;performance service, provides the foundation for applications in low&#8208;grade heat recovery, and offers new insights for more thermoelectric generators.

         <title>Aggregation Engineering of Toluene&#8208;Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air&#8208;Blade&#8208;Coated Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade&#8208;coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8&#8208;BO, and L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and its weak molecule&#8208;interaction with toluene, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based device yields an outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 19.31%.








Abstract
Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high&#8208;performance blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin&#8208;coating and blade&#8208;coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule&#8208;solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;ES1) and dominant J&#8208;aggregates in the blade&#8208;coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule&#8208;solvent interaction between L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent J&#8208;aggregation in blade&#8208;coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;&#8208;stacking than Y6 and L8&#8208;BO. Additionally, the blade&#8208;coated D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor&#8208;acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device based on D18/L8&#8208;BO&#8208;4Cl yields a remarkable power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post&#8208;treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8&#8208;BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air&#8208;blade&#8208;coated layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer OSCs.

     alt="Aggregation Engineering of Toluene-Processed Acceptor Layer Enables Over 19% Efficiency of Air-Blade-Coated Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To elucidate the mechanism of morphology regulation in the blade-coated active layer to obtain high efficiency, three analogous acceptors (Y6, L8-BO, and L8-BO-4Cl) are systematically compared. Benefiting from the unique molecular packing of L8-BO-4Cl and its weak molecule-interaction with toluene, the air-blade-coated D18/L8-BO-4Cl-based device yields an outstanding power-conversion efficiency of 19.31%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the unique features of photovoltaic materials in high-performance blade-coated organic solar cells (OSCs) is critical to narrow the device performance difference between spin-coating and blade-coating methods. In this work, it is clarified that the molecular packing of acceptor and molecule-solvent interaction plays an essential role in determining the photovoltaic performance of blade-coated layer-by-layer OSCs. It is demonstrated that the unique dimer packing feature of L8-BO-4Cl can lead to lower excited energy (&#8710;&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;) and dominant &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregates in the blade-coated film compared to the analogs of Y6 and L8-BO. Meanwhile, the weaker molecule-solvent interaction between L8-BO-4Cl and toluene is in favor of forming prominent &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;-aggregation in blade-coated film, contributing to a&#160;more compact &#960;-stacking than Y6 and L8-BO. Additionally, the blade-coated D18/L8-BO-4Cl film shows more defined interpenetrating networks with clearer donor-acceptor interfaces than D18/Y6 and D18/L8-BO, facilitating improved charge extraction and suppressed charge recombination. As a result, the air-blade-coated layer-by-layer device based on D18/L8-BO-4Cl yields a remarkable power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.31% without any additive and post-treatment, while much lower PCEs of 7.01% and 16.47% are obtained in the device based on D18/Y6 and D18/L8-BO, respectively. This work offers an effective approach to developing highly efficient air-blade-coated layer-by-layer OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so&#8208;called co&#8208;SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co&#8208;SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co&#8208;SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM&#8208;based HSLs in perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

Phase Transformation of Titanium Diselenide Devices
In article number 2418557, Wen&#8208;Wei Wu, and co&#8208;workers systematically investigate the phase transformation of titanium diselenide devices using in&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy. Their study reveals a bias&#8208;induced phase transformation driven by titanium self&#8208;intercalation, transitioning from hexagonal TiSe2 to the orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase. These findings offer valuable insights into the structural and electronic dynamics of 1T&#8208;TiSe2, highlighting its potential for future applications in charge&#8208;density&#8208;waves&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Functional Groups&#8208;Regulated Organic Semiconductors for Efficient Artificial Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively elaborates on functional groups&#8208;regulated OSCs that enhance photocatalytic H2O2 production performance, such as cyano, imine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, anthraquinone, sulfonic acid, halogen, etc. Functional groups containing O, N, and S elements contribute to increased charge separation and lower energy barriers for intermediate formation, ultimately enhancing the rate of photocatalytic H2O2 production.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environmentally friendly reagent, and organic semiconductors (OSCs) are ideal photocatalysts for the synthesis of H2O2 due to their well&#8208;defined molecular structure, strong donor&#8208;acceptor interactions, and efficient charge separation. This review discusses the regulatory mechanisms of functional group modifications in tuning the photocatalytic performance of OSCs, highlighting the relationship between functional group structure and catalytic performance. For example, electron&#8208;regulating groups, such as cyano and halogen, induce molecular dipoles, facilitating the migration of photogenerated electrons. Fluorine groups optimize the band structure and prolong carrier lifetime due to their high electronegativity. &#960;&#8208;Conjugated extension groups, like anthraquinone and thiophene, expand conjugation, improve visible light capture, and stabilize intermediates through redox cycles. Hydroxyl groups enhance surface hydrophilicity and promote H2O activation, while imine bond protonation adjusts charge distribution and improves selectivity and cycle stability. Multi&#8208;active site functional groups, such as sulfonic acid and amide, accelerate reaction kinetics and inhibit H2O2 decomposition. Functional groups enhance light absorption, charge separation, and surface reactions through electronic structure regulation, intermediate adsorption optimization, and proton&#8208;electron transfer. Future work should integrate machine learning to identify optimal functional group combinations and develop green functionalization strategies for efficient H2O2 photocatalyst synthesis.

         <title>Negative Enthalpy Doping Stabilizes P2&#8208;Type Oxides Cathode for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>

A negative enthalpy doping strategy can significantly increase its in&#8208;plane stability of the transition metal layer, which considerably suppresses destructive P2 to O2 phase transition and reduces lattice distortion, stabilizing the cycling performance of P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
P2&#8208;type Na0.67Ni0.33Mn0.67O2 (NNMO) as cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) largely suffers from continuous accumulation of local stress caused by destructive structural evolution and irreversible oxygen loss upon cycling, leading to rapid capacity degradation. Herein, a strategy of negative enthalpy doping (NED), wherein transition metal (TM) sites are substituted with 0.01&#160;mol each Sn, Sb, Cu, Ti, Mg, and Zn to increase the stability of the TM layers, is proposed. The robust structure of NED&#8208;NNMO significantly suppresses the P2 to O2 phase transition and improves the Na+ kinetics upon long&#8208;term cycling. Consequently, the NED&#8208;NNMO exhibits much smoothened voltage platforms and improved oxygen redox reversibility, thus considerably extended lifetime as compared with the pristine NNMO sample. The NED&#8208;NNMO delivers a high capacity of 138.9 mAh g&#8722;1 with an operation voltage of 3.51&#160;V under 0.1 C and prominent capacity retention of 94.6% after 100 cycles under 1 C, and 90.0% over 3000 cycles under ultra&#8208;high rate of 30 C, which is among the best over previous reports. Moreover, an ampere&#8208;hour scale pouch cell based on the NED&#8208;NNMO demonstrates an energy density of 139&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work sheds light on a route of negative enthalpy doping to design high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Using Multifunctional Small Molecule Dopants</title>

         <dc:description>
Unbalanced charge carrier injections and high densities of non&#8208;radiative recombination channels are still major obstacles to advancing high&#8208;efficiency blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). Here, a deep&#8208;HOMO level p&#8208;type small molecule, (2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dibromo&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl)phosphonic acid, constructs a better&#8208;balanced carrier injection due to improved hole and retarded electron injection by spontaneously centered at the bottom and top surfaces of perovskites films, along with modulation of all defects in bulk and at surface of doped films due to the formation of covalent bonds. With this approach a series of blue perovskite LEDs with external quantum efficiencies of up to 24.03% (485&#160;nm), 16.61% (476&#160;nm), and 8.55% (467&#160;nm) is designed.

         <title>An Adaptive Solid&#8208;State Synapse with Bi&#8208;Directional Relaxation for Multimodal Recognition and Spatio&#8208;Temporal Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A purely electric&#8208;modulated ferroelectric tunnel junction synapse capable of multimodal recognition and spatiotemporal learning has been successfully designed. Its unique functionality is achieved by integrating volatile oxygen vacancy migration and the nonvolatile polarization switching mechanisms within a single device, providing bidirectional relaxation and adaptive long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics, which are essential for multimodal recognition and spatiotemporal learning, respectively.








Abstract
The brain's unique processing power, such as perception, understanding, and interaction with the multimodal world, is achieved through diverse synaptic functionalities, which include varied temporal responses and adaptation. Although specific functions in brain&#8208;like computing have been successfully realized, emulating multimodal recognition and spatio&#8208;temporal learning remain significant challenges due to the difficulties in achieving multimodal signal processing and adaptive long&#8208;term plasticity in a single electronic synapse. Here, a purely electrically&#8208;modulated ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) memristive synapse which realizes multimodal recognition and spatio&#8208;temporal pattern identification, through the integration of oxygen vacancies migration and ferroelectric polarization switching mechanisms, providing bi&#8208;directional relaxation and adaptive long&#8208;term plasticity simultaneously in the isolated device. The bi&#8208;directional relaxation enables multimodal recognition in the purely electrically&#8208;modulated FTJ device by encoding distinct sensory signals with different electrical polarities. The multimodal perception task is implemented with a multimodal computing system combining visual and speech pattern recognition. Moreover, the adaptive long&#8208;term plasticity allows spatio&#8208;temporal pattern recognition, which is demonstrated by identifying object orientation and direction of motion with a neural network incorporating the arrayed synapses. This work provides a feasible approach for designing bio&#8208;realistic electronic synapses and achieving highly intelligent neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Rejuvenation of Tumor&#8208;Specific T Cells via Ultrahigh DAR Antibody&#8208;Polymeric Imidazoquinoline Complexes: Coordinated Targeting of PDL1 and Efficient TLR7/8 Activation in Intratumoral Dendritic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an ultrahigh drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio (DAR) antibody&#8208;polymeric imidazoquinoline complex (&#945;PDL1&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ) that activates intratumoral immature dendritic cells (imDCs) and enhances T&#8208;cell responses. By preferentially targeting PDL1&#8208;high DCs, it efficiently delivers the TLR7/8 agonist IMDQ, overcoming systemic inflammation and imDC&#8208;mediated immunosuppression, leading to significant tumor growth and metastasis inhibition, with potential for advancing tumor&#8208;targeted immunotherapy.









Abstract
Intratumoral dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal in tumor treatment due to their immature and pro&#8208;tumoral state induced by the tumor microenvironment. Clinically, these immature DCs correlate with disease progression and recurrence, adversely affecting prognosis. Activation of DCs by the TLR7/8 agonist imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) has yielded promising results, but they are limited by systemic inflammation risks, and high programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) expression on DCs impedes CD8+ T cell activity. Thus, the study introduces an antibody&#8208;polymeric IMDQ complex (&#945;PDL1&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ) with an ultrahigh drug&#8208;to&#8208;antibody ratio, where &#945;PDL1 is conjugated to Fc&#8208;binding peptides on polymeric IMDQ. This complex targets high PDL1&#8208;expressing intratumoral DCs with high probability, inducing PDL1&#8208;mediated endocytosis to deliver IMDQ to TLR7/8 within endosomes, effectively activating DCs (CD11c+MHC II+: 2.33% versus 1.09%, CD11c+CD86+: 2.49% versus 1.00% on tumors compared to phosphate&#8208;buffered saline treatment) and priming T cells. It also blocks PDL1/PD1 interactions, enhancing tumor&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell activation and memory. Notably, &#945;PDL1&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ achieved a 97% tumor inhibition rate, prevented tumor regrowth in rechallenge experiments, and reduced lung metastases of tumors by 83%. These findings underscore its potential for intratumoral DC&#8208;targeted immunotherapy and novel systemic IMDQ and checkpoint inhibitor combinations.

         <title>Core/Shell&#8208;Structured Carbon Support Boosting Fuel Cell Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study designs a bifunctional core/shell&#8208;structured carbon support with the core of highly graphitized carbon and the shell of heteroatom&#8208;doped amorphous carbon, precise control of Pt nanoparticles semi&#8208;embedded by the amorphous shell contributes to the realization of simultaneously exceeded durability targets of electrocatalysts and carbon support for PEMFCs.








Abstract
To enhance the lifetime of proton exchange membrane fuel cells, developing highly durable platinum&#8208;based cathode catalysts is essential. While two degradation pathways for the cathode catalyst&#8212;carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst (platinum nanoparticles) coarsening&#8212;have been identified, current approaches to enhance its durability are limited to addressing individual degradation pathways. Herein, the study develops a core/shell&#8208;structured carbon support that is designed to afford cathode catalysts capable of simultaneously inhibiting carbon corrosion and electrocatalyst coarsening. The core/shell structure is distinguished by its bifunctional nature: the core is made of highly graphitized carbon tailored to build a robust carbon skeleton, and the shell comprises heteroatom&#8208;doped amorphous carbon engineered to prevent electrocatalyst coarsening by chemical/physical anchoring of platinum nanoparticles. Thanks to this elaborate design, the catalyst surpasses the durability targets for carbon supports and electrocatalysts set by the U.S. Department of Energy, as supported by the achieved durability metrics after the square&#8208;wave/triangle&#8208;wave accelerated stress tests: electrochemical surface area loss at 13%/3%, mass activity loss at 27%/17%, and voltage loss of 29&#160;mV (at 0.8 A&#160;cm&#8722;2)/4&#160;mV (at 1.5 A&#160;cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Porous Silicon Nanoneedles Efficiently Deliver Adenine Base Editor to Correct a Recurrent Pathogenic COL7A1 Variant in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Base editing using nanoneedles efficiently corrects pathogenic variants in the type VII collagen gene of primary fibroblasts from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. Nanoneedle editing induces minimal and reversible transcriptional perturbations while restoring the production and secretion of functional type VII collagen. The study highlights the value of nanoneedles as a tool for base editing in cell therapies for genetic disorders.








Abstract
Base editing, a CRISPR&#8208;based genome editing technology, enables precise correction of single&#8208;nucleotide variants, promising resolutive treatment for monogenic genetic disorders like recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). However, the application of base editors in cell manufacturing is hindered by inconsistent efficiency and high costs, contributed by suboptimal delivery methods. Nanoneedles have emerged as an effective delivery approach, enabling highly efficient, non&#8208;perturbing gene therapies both in vitro and in vivo. Here we demonstrate that nanoneedle delivery of an adenine base editor corrects a heterozygous single&#8208;nucleotide pathogenic variant in COL7A1 in primary RDEB fibroblasts in vitro with 96.5% efficiency, without inducing off&#8208;target variants. The nanoneedle delivery maintains cell viability and displays modest phenotypical alterations unlike conventional cationic lipid transfection. The nanoneedle&#8208;mediated editing significantly increases the production and secretion of full&#8208;length type VII collagen protein, contributing to restore functional fibroblasts phenotype by improving cell adhesion. These findings underscore the suitability and safety of nanoneedles for gene editing in a clinically relevant context of cell manufacturing, establishing a foundation for their use in cell therapies.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Flexible Pixelated Perovskite Photodetectors Enabled by Honeycomb Polymer Grids for High&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired, photolithography&#8208;free, flexible, pixelated perovskite photosensitive films serve not only as a high&#8208;resolution pixelation platform but also as a stress&#8208;relief mechanism for otherwise brittle perovskite films, enabling enhanced mechanical flexibility. This synergetic approach yields pixelated perovskite layers with &#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m pixel sizes, &#8776;100&#160;nm gaps, and 2000 PPI resolution. Assembled photodetector arrays offer detectivity greater than 1013 Jones with cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free imaging. The flexible polymer grid also enhances mechanical durability, expanding potential applications in robotics, biomedical imaging, and virtual/augmented reality.








Abstract
A nature&#8208;inspired fabrication method based on a photolithography&#8208;free flexible polymer grid is reported for high&#8208;resolution pixelation of perovskite photodiode arrays with exceptional mechanical ductility and a morphology resembling that of natural compound eyes. The resulting pixelated perovskite photosensitive layer has a &#8776;1&#160;&#181;m pixel size with 2000 Pixels per inch (PPI) resolution when fully assembled as a photodetector array, delivering a detectivity of &gt;1013 Jones while providing cross&#8208;talk free imaging. Using a polymer grid effectively releases stress on the perovskite platform, greatly increasing the mechanical agility of the otherwise brittle perovskite film. This novel fabrication methodology and device design offer new possibilities for applications in robotics, biomedical imaging, and virtual and augmented reality.

         <title>In&#8208;liquid Superspreading Space&#8208;confined Epitaxy on Superamphiphilic Surfaces for Pt(II) Complex Crystalline Film Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;liquid superspreading space&#8208;confined epitaxy approach is proposed to fabricate Pt (II) complexes crystalline films on superamphiphilic surface. By regulation of the diffusion process, precise control over the nucleation and crystal growth is achieved, resulting in the formation of planar crystalline films. These films exhibit multi&#8208;signal sensing ability, making them suitable for reaffirmed sensing detector in complex and unstable conditions.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;based method is regarded as a promising approach to fabricate large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality crystalline films, owing to its low&#8208;cost manufacturing and facile features. However, traditional solution&#8208;based methods still suffer from random simultaneous nucleation and uncontrollable crystal growth which result in polycrystalline films and coffee&#8208;ring effect. Herein, it is proposed that an in&#8208;liquid superspreading space&#8208;confined epitaxy approach on a superamphiphilic surface to fabricate crystalline films with controllable initial nucleation and crystal morphology. With delicate control of the liquid environment, concentration, and superspreading space&#8208;confined solvent film thickness, planar crystalline films with high crystallinity and smooth morphology are obtained. A controllable dewetting crystallization mechanism is proposed, indicating that the diffusion coefficient, regulated by liquid environment, can control the dewetting process during crystallization. With the balance of solvent diffusion and solute precipitation in crystallization, the ordered in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane molecular stacking is achieved. And the as&#8208;prepared planar Pt(II) complex crystalline film exhibits multi&#8208;signal sensing ability, which can be further used to fabricate the reaffirmed sensing detector for precise gas sensing in complex and unstable conditions. This study demonstrates a facile approach for crystalline film fabrication with controllable nucleation and morphology in a liquid environment, which holds promising applications in the construction of oxygen or water&#8208;sensitive organic/inorganic devices.

         <title>Translational Selenium Nanoparticles Promotes Clinical Non&#8208;small&#8208;cell Lung Cancer Chemotherapy via Activating Selenoprotein&#8208;driven Immune Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study, for the first time, highlights the translational SeNPs&#8208;enhanced therapeutic efficacy against advanced NSCLC and elucidates the underlying mechanisms involving selenoprotein&#8208;driven immune manipulation. The clinical Investigator&#8208;initiated Trial shows that translational SeNPs supplementation in combination with bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy with an objective response rate of 83.3% and a disease control rate of 100%, through potentiating selenoprotein&#8208;driven antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Reconstructing the tumor immune microenvironment is an effective strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy limited by immunosuppression in non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, it is found that selenium (Se) depletion and immune dysfunction are present in patients with advanced NSCLC compared with healthy volunteers. Surprisingly, Se deficiency resulted in decreased immunity and accelerated rapid tumor growth in the mice model, which further reveals that the correlation between micronutrient Se and lung cancer progression. This pioneering work achieves 500&#8208;L scale production of Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) at GMP level and utilizes it to reveal how and why the trace element Se can enhance clinical immune&#8208;mediated treatment efficacy against NSCLC. The results found that translational SeNPs can promote the proliferation of NK cells and enhance its cytotoxicity against cancer cells by activating mTOR signaling pathway driven by GPXs to regulate the secretion of cytokines to achieve an antitumor response. Moreover, a clinical study of an Investigator&#8208;initiated Trial shows that translational SeNPs supplementation in combination with bevacizumab/cisplatin/pemetrexed exhibits enhanced therapeutic efficacy with an objective response rate of 83.3% and a disease control rate of 100%, through potentiating selenoprotein&#8208;driven antitumor immunity. Taken together, this study, for the first time, highlights the translational SeNPs&#8208;enhanced therapeutic efficacy against clinical advanced NSCLC.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Cell Micromotors for Degenerative Knee Osteoarthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized artificial cellular micromotors are synthesized to achieve phototropic movement under light conditions. The protons released by the light reaction inside the micromotor combine with the natural ATP synthase on the surface to synthesize and release ATP, which slows down the disease process of degenerative knee osteoarthritis to a certain extent.








Abstract
Combining artificial cellular compartmentalization and intelligent motion benefits of micro/nanomotors, light is used as energy input to construct an artificial cell&#8208;based micromotor capable of photosynthetic anabolism and intelligent directional movement. This system is assembled from phospholipids functionalized with F&#8208;ATP synthase and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanoparticles (Vesical@MoS2&#8208;ATPase). The underlying mechanism involves the generation of protons (H+) through photo&#8208;hydrolysis of MoS2 nanoparticles within vesicles, which generates a local electroosmotic flow inside the vesicles and drives the negatively charged MoS2 toward light. The established proton gradient across the phospholipid membrane, in turn, drives the ATP synthase to catalyze ATP production. Both in vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that the micromotor can elevate local intracellular ATP levels upon light and improve the metabolism of denatured chondrocytes. This cell mimicry, with capabilities of migration and biosynthesis, emerges as a promising platform for the next generation of functional bio&#8208;interface.

The underlying mechanism involves the generation of protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) through photo-hydrolysis of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles within vesicles, which generates a local electroosmotic flow inside the vesicles and drives the negatively charged MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; toward light. The established proton gradient across the phospholipid membrane, in turn, drives the ATP synthase to catalyze ATP production. Both in vitro and in vivo models demonstrate that the micromotor can elevate local intracellular ATP levels upon light and improve the metabolism of denatured chondrocytes. This cell mimicry, with capabilities of migration and biosynthesis, emerges as a promising platform for the next generation of functional bio-interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co/Mo Sites Anchored on Mesoporous Carbon Hollow Spheres for Highly Selective Oxygen Reduction to Hydrogen Peroxide in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Co/Mo sites anchored on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS) are designed via template&#8208;engaged strategy for two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction. Owing to the mesoporous hollow merits and electron&#8208;donating effect from Mo species, the Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS electrocatalyst displays efficient two&#8208;electron pathway with high hydrogen peroxide selectivity, and stable operation in acid.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) in acidic media is a promising route for the decentralized and on&#8208;site hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation. Nevertheless, strong interaction between active sites and *OOH intermediates usually induces the O&#9472;O bond cleavage to convert 2e&#8722; pathway into the sluggish 4e&#8722; ORR. Therefore, it is highly necessary to optimize the electronic structure of 2e&#8722; ORR electrocatalysts for the regulation of adsorption energy. Herein, we propose the utilization of atomically dispersed Co/Mo sites anchored on mesoporous carbon hollow spheres (Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS) via a template&#8208;engaged strategy for highly selective ORR to H2O2 in acid. Benefitting from the electron&#8208;donating effect of Mo atoms, an enriched electron density around the Co center for Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS is observed, resulting in optimal adsorption of the key *OOH intermediates to approach the apex of 2e&#8722; ORR volcano plot. Moreover, the introduction of Mo species simultaneously suppresses the electroreduction of as&#8208;obtained H2O2 on Co sites. As a consequence, Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS delivers a high H2O2 selectivity of 90&#8211;95% in acid. The flow cell based on the Co/Mo&#8208;MCHS catalyst achieves a remarkable H2O2 yield of 2102&#160;mg for 150&#160;h. Moreover, this strategy can be extended to other early transition metal elements with similar electronic modifier effects.

         <title>A 2D/3D Heterostructure Perovskite Solar Cell with a Phase&#8208;Pure and Pristine 2D Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solution&#8208;based method that can achieve pristine (without residual 2D precursors) and phase&#8208;pure 2D/3D perovskite heterostructure without the need for synthesizing a single crystal is developed. Perovskite solar cells with this treatment demonstrate a notable improvement in both power conversion efficiency and long&#8208;term stability, with negligible hysteresis, compared to the conventional process.








Abstract
Interface engineering plays a critical role in advancing the performance of perovskite solar cells. As such, 2D/3D perovskite heterostructures are of particular interest due to their optoelectrical properties and their further potential improvements. However, for conventional solution&#8208;processed 2D perovskites grown on an underlying 3D perovskite, the reaction stoichiometry is normally unbalanced with excess precursors. Moreover, the formed 2D perovskite is impure, leading to unfavorable energy band alignment at the interface. Here a simple method is presented that solves both issues simultaneously. The 2D formation reaction is taken first to completion, fully consuming excess PbI2. Then, isopropanol is utilized to remove excess organic ligands, control the 2D perovskite thickness, and obtain a phase&#8208;pure, n = 2, 2D perovskite. The outcome is a pristine (without residual 2D precursors) and phase&#8208;pure 2D perovskite heterostructure with improved surface passivation and charge carrier extraction compared to the conventional solution process. PSCs incorporating this treatment demonstrate a notable improvement in both stability and power conversion efficiency, with negligible hysteresis, compared to the conventional process.

         <title>Muscle&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Growing Anisotropic Hydrogels with Mechanical Training&#8208;Promoting Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Muscles represent one of the toughest anisotropic soft matters. The appealing features originate from their unique aligned fiber&#8208;based structures, which form via a combining process involving two major essentials: absorbing nutrients for matrix growth and mechanical training to strengthen the matrix. In this work, a mechanical training&#8208;associated growing strategy is proposed to mimic this process for preparing tough anisotropic hydrogels with tunable sizes and enhanced mechanical properties.








Abstract
Muscles are highly anisotropic, force&#8208;bearing issues. They form via a process involving nutrient absorption for matrix growth and mechanical training for matrix toughening, in which cyclic disassembly&#8208;reconstruction of muscle fibers plays a critical role in generating strong anisotropic structures. Inspired by this process, a mechanical training&#8208;associated growing strategy is developed for preparing tough anisotropic hydrogels. Using anisotropic hydrogels made from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)/tannic acid (TA) as an example, it is demonstrated that the hydrogels can absorb poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) via disassembling their aligned nanofibrillar structures. Incorporation of PEGDA within the hydrogels induces PVA to form crystal domains while subsequent mechanical training can restore the aligned fibrillar structures. Such a combining process results in expansion in materials&#8217; size (&#8776;2 times) and significant enhancement in their mechanical properties (Young's modulus: from 2.4 to 2.85&#160;MPa; ultimate tensile strength: from 8.2 to 14.1&#160;MPa; toughness: from 335 to 465&#160;MJ m&#8722;3). With a high energy dissipation efficiency (&#8776;90%), potential applications for these tough and adaptable hydrogels are envisioned in impact&#8208;protective materials, surgical sutures, etc.

         <title>Proximity&#8208;Mediated Multi&#8208;Ferroelectric Coupling in Highly Strained EuO&#8208;Graphene Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magneto&#8208;ferroelectric effects in van der Waals EuO/graphene heterostructures emerge via a topotactic method, inducing high compressive strain. This strain stabilizes a ferroelectric state up to room temperature, coexisting with the magnetic proximity effect in graphene. These intertwined magneto&#8208;electric effects enable control of magnetization and polarization, offering the potential for next&#8208;gen memory and neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
2D van der Waals materials and their heterostructures are a fantastic playground to explore emergent phenomena arising from electronic quantum hybridization effects. In the last decade, the spin&#8208;dependant hybridization effect pushed this frontier further introducing the magnetic proximity effect as a promising tool for spintronic applications. Here the uncharted proximity&#8208;controlled magnetoelectric effect in EuO/graphene heterostructure is unveiled. This is obtained while creating a new multiferroic hybrid heterostructure with multifunctional properties. Using a topotactic method magnetic insulating EuO thin films on graphene is grown under high compressive strain, which induces the appearance of an additional ferroelectric order, with an electric polarization that reaches up to 18 &#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. This observation therefore quantitatively confirms the theoretical predictions made 15 years ago of a strain&#8208;induced ferroelectric state in EuO. Moreover, the EuO induces a magnetic proximity state into the graphene layer by interfacial hybridization. This new ferroelectric state in the EuO/graphene heterostructure is stable up to room temperature where it coexists with the EuO/graphene magnetic state. Furthermore, intertwined magneto&#8208;electric effects are shown in these strained heterostructures which can facilitate the manipulation of magnetization and electric polarization in future memory and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Crossing the Dimensional Divide with Optoelectronic Tweezers: Multicomponent Light&#8208;Driven Micromachines with Motion Transfer in Three Dimensions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, multi&#8208;component micromachines are developed that facilitate 3D motion transfer across different planes. These light&#8208;driven 3D micromachines, fabricated using standard photolithography combined with direct laser writing, are assembled and actuated via programmable light patterns within an optoelectronic tweezers system. Utilizing charge&#8208;induced repulsion and dielectrophoretic levitation effects, the micromachines enable highly efficient mechanical rotation and effective inter&#8208;component motion transfer.








Abstract
Micromachines capable of performing diverse mechanical tasks in complex and constrained microenvironments are of great interest. Despite important milestones in this pursuit, until now, micromachines are confined to actuation within a single 2D plane due to the challenges of transferring motion across different planes in limited space. Here, a breakthrough method is presented to overcome this limitation: multi&#8208;component micromachines that facilitate 3D motion transfer across different planes. These light&#8208;driven 3D micromachines, fabricated using standard photolithography combined with direct laser writing, are assembled and actuated via programmable light patterns within an optoelectronic tweezers system. Utilizing charge&#8208;induced repulsion and dielectrophoretic levitation effects, the micromachines enable highly efficient mechanical rotation and effective inter&#8208;component motion transfer. Through this work, fascinating patterns of similarities are unveiled for the new microscale 3D systems when compared with the macro&#8208;scale world in which they live, paving the way for the development of micromechanical devices and microsystems with ever increasing functionality and versatility.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Correlated Charge to Spin Conversion in Metallic Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital angular momentum (OAM) generated via interfacial orbital Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effect is demonstrated to significantly enhance the SOT efficiency in metallic antiferromagnet IrMn&#8208;based heterostructures. The SOT efficiency variation with IrMn thickness reveals the orbital current transportation and conversion process in IrMn. The OAM contribution is verified by the critical current density decreasing of SOT&#8208;driven magnetization switching.








Abstract
Current&#8208;induced spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) allows efficient electrical manipulation on magnetization in spintronic devices. Maximizing the SOT efficiency is a key goal that is pursued via increasing the net spin generation and accumulation. However, spin transport in antiferromagnets is seriously restricted due to the strong antiferromagnetic coupling, which blocks the development of antiferromagnetic&#8208;based devices. Here, a significant enhancement of SOT efficiency in Ir20Mn80 (IrMn)&#8208;based heterostructure associated with the orbital effect of naturally oxidized Cu (Cu*) bottom layer is reported. Considering the weak spin&#8211;orbit coupling of Cu*, the enhancement results from an orbital current generated from charge current at the Cu*/IrMn interface that contributes to spin current in the IrMn layer due to the strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The SOT efficiency variation with IrMn thickness reveals the process of orbital angular momentum (OAM) transportation and conversion. Moreover, the contribution of orbital current is verified by the critical current density decreasing of SOT&#8208;driven magnetization switching in Cu*/IrMn/[Co/Pt]3 heterostructure. This study opens a path to design high&#8208;efficient SOT&#8208;based spintronic devices combining the advantages of OAM and metallic antiferromagnets.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Directed Nanocellulose Assembly for Interfacial Phase&#8208;Transfer Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic nanocellulose self&#8208;assembles into mechanically robust nanomesh architectures at oil&#8208;water interfaces through charge&#8208;directed assembly. The resulting structures feature uniform &#8220;breathing holes&#8221; (&#8776;34&#160;nm) enabling efficient mass transfer. When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves &gt;90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional catalyst stability through multiple cycles.








Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces present unique opportunities for sustainable biphasic catalysis, yet concurrent amplification of molecular transport and reactivity at these boundaries remains challenging. Here it is demonstrated that high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio cationic nanocellulose (HNC+) spontaneously self&#8208;assembles into mechanically robust nanomesh architectures at oil&#8208;water interfaces through charge&#8208;directed assembly. This assembly is driven by electrostatic attraction between the cationic nanofibers and the intrinsic negative charge at hydrophobic&#8208;aqueous interfaces (&#963; &#8776;&#8722;0.3&#160;C&#160;m&#8722;2), generating sufficient excess attractive force (&#916;U &#8776;&#8722;1,200&#160;kBT) to overcome image charge repulsion. The resulting nanomesh exhibits uniform &#8220;breathing holes&#8221; (&#8776;34&#160;nm) and exceptional stability under extreme conditions (pH 2&#8211;13, 1.8&#160;m NaCl, and 90&#160;&#176;C). When applied to oxidative desulfurization, the system achieves &gt;90% thiophene removal under ambient conditions with exceptional atom economy (E&#8208;factor &lt;&#160;1.1) and catalyst stability through multiple cycles. This breakthrough strategy for interfacial engineering using renewable materials opens new possibilities for green chemical manufacturing while providing fundamental insights into charge&#8208;mediated assembly at liquid interfaces. These findings establish a viable pathway for sustainable heterogeneous catalysis that aligns with circular economy principles.

         <title>Efficient H2O2 Electrosynthesis in Acidic media via Multiscale Catalyst Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research introduces an innovative octahedron&#8208;like cobalt structure embedded in hierarchical porous nanofibers, significantly optimizing hydrogen peroxide production in acidic environments. Achieving 80% faradaic efficiency at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stable operation over 120 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, this approach provides a scalable and sustainable pathway to enhance industrial hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Electrochemically generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen offers a more sustainable and cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional anthraquinone process. In alkaline conditions, H2O2 is unstable as HO2&#8722;, and in neutral electrolytes, alkali cation crossover causes system instability. Producing H2O2 in acidic electrolytes ensures enhanced stability and efficiency. However, in acidic conditions, the oxygen reduction reaction mechanism is dominated by the inner&#8208;sphere electron transfer pathway, requiring careful consideration of both reaction and mass transfer kinetics. These stringent requirements limit H2O2 production efficiency, typically below 10&#8211;20% at industrial&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Using a multiscale approach that combines active site tuning with macrostructure tuning, this work presents an octahedron&#8208;like cobalt structure on interconnected hierarchical porous nanofibers, achieving a faradaic efficiency exceeding 80% at 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable operation for over 120 h at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. At 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the optimized catalyst demonstrates a cell potential of 2.14&#160;V, resulting in an energy efficiency of 26%.

         <title>Titanium Self&#8208;Intercalation in Titanium Diselenide Devices: Insights from In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates bias&#8208;induced structural transformations in 1T&#8208;TiSe2 devices, focusing on the transition from the 1T metallic phase to the distorted 1Td phase and ultimately to an orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase. Using ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ TEM, dynamic structural changes and insights into the effect of thickness on phase transitions, providing valuable information for CDW&#8208;based device applications, are revealed. 









Abstract
Metallic transition metal dichalcogenides (MTMDCs) are of significant attention for various electronic applications due to their anisotropic conductivity, high electron mobility, superconductivity, and charge&#8208;density&#8208;waves (CDW). Understanding the correlations between electronic properties and structural transformations is crucial. In this study, a bias&#8208;induced structural transformation in vertical CDW&#8208;based 1T&#8208;TiSe2 devices, transitioning from a 1T metallic phase to a distorted transition 1Td phase and subsequently to an orthorhombic Ti9Se2 conducting phase, is reported. Using ex&#8208;situ and in&#8208;situ biasing transmission electron microscopy, dynamic structural changes, while electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis revealed valence state modifications in Ti and Se within the Ti&#8208;rich layer after biasing, are observed. In addition, the effect of varying 1T&#8208;TiSe2 thickness on the maximum current value is investigated. These observations reveal that increased thickness requires higher voltage to induce phase transitions. These insights contribute to understanding the structural and electronic dynamics of 1T&#8208;TiSe2, highlighting its potential as a promising material for future CDW&#8208;based device applications.

         <title>In Situ Cross&#8208;Linking and Interfacial Engineering via Multifunctional Diamine Additive for High&#8208;Temperature Magnesium Metal Batteries</title>

A robust in situ cross&#8208;linked polymer electrolyte and its derived Mg3N2&#8208;rich bilayer interphase are obtained by a multifunctional diamine additive. The assembled Mo6S8//Mg cells demonstrate stable cycling over 200 cycles at 150&#160;&#176;C with 80% capacity retention.








Abstract
The electrolyte and its interfacial chemistry are crucial for the development of high&#8208;temperature magnesium metal batteries. Here, a robust in situ cross&#8208;linked gel polymer electrolyte (MgB@CGPE) and its derived Mg3N2&#8208;rich (Mg3N2 and related Mg&#9472;N&#9472;H complexes) interphase are obtained by a multifunctional diamine additive. The Mg3N2&#8208;rich interphase exhibits low magnesium ion migration activation energy and can effectively inhibit the continuous decomposition of electrolyte at the interface under elevated temperatures. Moreover, the MgB@CGPE can enable reversible magnesium deposition and dissolution over a wide temperature range of 30&#8211;180&#160;&#176;C. The assembled Mo6S8//MgB@CGPE//Mg cells demonstrate stable cycling over 200 cycles at 150&#160;&#176;C with 80% capacity retention. Additionally, these cells also address crucial mechanical and thermal safety concerns, indicating their potential for use under extreme conditions. This work presents a universal and practical strategy for designing polymer electrolytes that operate at elevated temperatures.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal Sulfide Nanocrystal Libraries for Highly Reversible Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing a two&#8208;step synthesis approach, a library of high&#8208;entropy metal sulfide (HEMS) materials spanning quinary to duodenary compositions are built by arbitrarily combining 5&#8211;12 elements from 28 candidates in the periodic table. The septenary HEMS particles exhibit remarkable cycling stability&#8212;retaining&#8776;230 mAh g&#8722;1 over 3000 cycles&#8212;attributed to uniform metal mixing during discharge.








Abstract
Controlled synthesis of high&#8208;entropy materials offers a unique platform to explore unprecedented electrochemical properties. High&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (HEMSs) have recently emerged as promising electrodes in electrochemical energy storage applications. However, synthesizing HEMSs with a tunable number of components and composition is still challenging. Here, a HEMS library is built by using a general synthetic approach, enabling the synthesis of HEMS with arbitrary combinations of 5 to 12 out of 28 elements in the periodic table. The formation of a solid solution of HEMS is attributed to the two&#8208;step method that lowers the energy barrier and facilitates the sulfur diffusion during the synthesis. The hard soft acid base (HSAB) theory is used to precisely describe the conversion rates of the metal precursors during the synthesis. The HEMSs as cathodes in Na&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) is investigated, where 7&#8208;component HEMS (7&#8208;HEMS) delivers a promising rate capability and an exceptional sodium storage performance with reversible a capacity of 230 mAh g&#8722;1 over 3000 cycles. This work paves the way for the multidisciplinary exploration of HEMSs and their potential in electrochemical energy storage.

         <title>Dual Oxidation Suppression in Lead&#8208;Free Perovskites for Low&#8208;Threshold and Long&#8208;Lifespan Lasing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual oxidation suppression strategy is developed to suppress the Sn2+ oxidation in 2D tin perovskites, i.e. adopting an oxygen&#8208;free two&#8208;step growth to enhance the crystal quality and incorporating electron&#8208;donating biuret molecules to coordinate with Sn2+. As a result, nanolasers based on these tin perovskite flakes exhibited an ultralow lasing threshold of &lt;1 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 and superior lasing stability.








Abstract
Low lasing threshold and long&#8208;term operational stability are essential in advancing cost&#8208;effective, efficient lead&#8208;free (tin) halide perovskite lasers. However, the rapid crystallization of tin perovskites and oxidation of Sn2+ lead to substantial amounts of lattice defects, detrimental to laser performance enhancement. Herein, a dual oxidation suppression strategy is developed to suppress the oxidation of Sn2+ 2D tin halide perovskites, i.e., adopting an oxygen&#8208;free two&#8208;step growth to enhance the crystal quality and incorporating electron&#8208;donating biuret molecules to coordinate with Sn2+ during the crystal growth, which led to the substantial reduction of lasing threshold to &lt;1 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 in (PEA)2MASn2I7. This represents the lowest value in lead&#8208;free perovskite nanolasers and approximately one order of magnitude lower than those previously reported for tin&#8208;based nanolasers. Investigations into the spontaneous photoluminescence (PL) and stimulated lasing emission revealed that 2D tin perovskites exhibited superior photostability and lasing stability compared to their lead counterparts. Specifically, the lasing intensity of (PEA)2MA2Sn3I10 constantly increased by &gt;300% under optical pumping and the lasing threshold decreased by &#8776;17%, which is not observed in their lead counterparts. The findings highlight the prospect of 2D tin halide perovskites as lead&#8208;free gain materials and cavities for solution&#8208;processed nanolasers with low lasing thresholds and exceptional stability.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy High&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Piezoelectricity Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of a high&#8208;entropy strategy into CaBi2Nb2O9 achieves significant breakthroughs in piezoelectric and ferroelectric performance by designing local polarization configuration and defect structure, which causes the formation of high&#8208;density 2D amorphous defect, contributing to extra out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization components. This work provides a widely applicable paradigm for designing more novel high&#8208;performance bismuth layer&#8208;structured ferroelectrics.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature piezoelectric materials are essential components of transducers and accelerometers applied in the fields of aircraft engines, automobiles, nuclear power units, etc., yet how to achieve large piezoelectricity accompanied by high Curie temperature and superior resistivity is still a big challenge. Here, the high&#8208;entropy strategy is utilized to design bismuth&#8208;layer high&#8208;temperature piezoelectric ceramics, resulting in an excellent comprehensive piezoelectric performance with a record&#8208;high figure of merit (d33*TC) and a high electrical DC resistivity of 1.0 &#215; 106&#160;&#937;&#160;cm at 750&#160;&#176;C. High&#8208;energy synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy results suggest that there is no significant change in long&#8208;range average orthorhombic structure through high&#8208;entropy engineering, providing a structural basis for retaining a high TC. Encouragingly, highly dense bismuth&#8208;layer vacancies occupied by alien atoms trigger extra unique out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in perovskite layers around these 2D amorphous defects, as confirmed by quantitative analysis of local polarization configurations and density functional theory calculations. Together with the decreased polarization reversal energy barrier, the high entropy strategy benefits polarization flexibility under external stimulation and offers breakthroughs in electrical properties. This work provides new insight into the improvement of comprehensive functional properties through the cocktail effect and structure mechanism for designing novel high&#8208;entropy materials.

Abstract
Silicon (Si) photonics has been widely explored for many various applications, including optical communication, optoelectronic computing, spectroscopy, and image sensing. As a key component for optoelectronic signal conversion in these applications, Si&#8208;based infrared photodetectors have attracted extensive attention. However, achieving all&#8208;Si on&#8208;chip photodetection in the very long&#8208;wavelength infrared (VLWIR) range remains challenging, with broadband enhancement and improved operating temperature being pressing issues that need to be addressed. An all&#8208;Si photodetector design is presented using in&#8208;plane photon trapping structures (IPTS) to enhance detection efficiency and improve the operating temperature of the photodetector at the VLWIR range. The photodetector achieves a broadband enhancement of 285&#8211;575% (across 12&#8211;19&#160;&#181;m) and a 31% reduction in dark current. Additionally, it exhibits an impressive peak specific detectivity of 1.9 &#215; 1010&#160;cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 15&#160;&#181;m, operating at a temperature of 40 K. This study introduces a novel all&#8208;Si optoelectronic device architecture that offers a promising solution for improving the operating temperature and sensitivity of broadband VLWIR devices, making the whole system more compact and cost&#8208;effective.

         <title>Formulation and Characterization of Novel Ionizable and Cationic Lipid Nanoparticles for the Delivery of Splice&#8208;Switching Oligonucleotides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) of unconventional composition and defined structures are investigated as small oligonucleotide carriers. A composition is identified that outperforms Onpattro in cargo delivery to HeLa cells. The structure of these LNPs resembles a micellar cubic phase not commonly associated with high&#8208;performing LNPs. The results shed light on the LNP structure&#8208;function relationship and highlight the complexity of these platforms.








Abstract
Despite increasing knowledge about the mechanistic aspects of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as oligonucleotide carriers, the structure&#8208;function relationship in LNPs has been generally overlooked. Understanding this correlation is critical in the rational design of LNPs. Here, a materials characterization approach is utilized, applying structural information from small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering experiments to design novel LNPs focusing on distinct lipid organizations with a minimal compositional variation. The lipid phase structures are characterized in these LNPs and their corresponding bulk lipid mixtures with small&#8208;angle scattering techniques, and the LNP&#8208;cell interactions in vitro with respect to cytotoxicity, hemolysis, cargo delivery, cell uptake, and lysosomal swelling. An LNP is identified that outperforms Onpattro lipid composition using lipid components and molar ratios which differ from the gold standard clinical LNPs. The base structure of these LNPs has an inverse micellar phase organization, whereas the LNPs with inverted hexagonal phases are not functional, suggesting that this phase formation may not be needed for LNP&#8208;mediated oligonucleotide delivery. The importance of stabilizer choice for the LNP function is demonstrated and super&#8208;resolution microscopy highlights the complexity of the delivery mechanisms, where lysosomal swelling for the majority of LNPs is observed. This study highlights the importance of advanced characterization for the rational design of LNPs to enable the study of structure&#8208;function relationships.

         <title>Integrating Strong Luminescence and High Mobility in Organic Single Crystals of Covalent Pyrene Dimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (&#181; = 32.6 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) are simultaneously harvested in the single crystal of covalent pyrene dimer, which is substantially ascribed to the strong emission from intramolecular hybridized local and charge&#8722;transfer state and the 2D charge transport enabled by the intermolecular uniform herringbone stacking.








Abstract
Simultaneously achieving strong luminescence and high mobility in organic semiconductors remains a challenge. Herein, two covalently dimerized pyrene derivatives (1Py&#8208;2Py and 1Py&#8208;1Py) with distinct chemical linkages and crystal packing arrangements are presented. Remarkably, the radiative transition of pyrene is gradually unforbidden from 1Py&#8208;2Py to 1Py&#8208;1Py. Moreover, 1Py&#8208;2Py showcases 1D long&#8208;range &#960;&#9472;&#960; stacking, while 1Py&#8208;1Py exhibits 2D herringbone packing formed by a vast network of intermolecular C&#9472;H&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;&#960; interactions. To the surprise, both high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY = 72.17%) and high hole mobility (&#181; = 32.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) are simultaneously harvested in 1Py&#8208;1Py crystal, which are far superior to those in 1Py&#8208;2Py crystal (PLQY = 48.66% and &#181; = 0.05 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1). These findings underscore the potential of covalent pyrene dimer with 1&#8208;position linkages as a promising organic semiconductor for the exceptional combination of strong luminescence and high mobility, which is substantially ascribed to the efficiently unforbidden emission and the favorable 2D charge transport pathways.

         <title>Simultaneous Isotropic Omnidirectional Hypersensitive Strain Sensing and Deep Learning&#8208;Assisted Direction Recognition in a Biomimetic Stretchable Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Omnidirectional strain sensing is crucial in healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and human&#8208;machine interfaces. By mimicking the 3D structure of human fingers, this work introduces a novel heterogeneous substrate incorporating the involute of a circle which enables the device to achieve isotropic omnidirectional hypersensitive strain sensing and directional recognition simultaneously.








Abstract
Omnidirectional strain sensing and direction recognition ability are features of the human tactile sense, essential to address the intricate and dynamic requirements of real&#8208;world applications. Most of the current strain sensors work by converting uniaxial strain into electrical signals, which restricts their use in environments with multiaxial strain. Here, the first device with simultaneous isotropic omnidirectional hypersensitive strain sensing and direction recognition (IOHSDR) capabilities is introduced. By mimicking the human fingers from three dimensions, the IOHSDR device realizes a novel heterogeneous substrate that incorporates the involute of a circle, resulting in isotropic behavior in the radial direction and anisotropic property in the involute direction for hypersensitive strain sensing. With the assistance of a deep learning&#8208;based model, the IOHSDR device accomplishes an impressive accuracy of 99.58% in recognizing 360&#176; stretching directions. Additionally, it exhibits superior performance in the typical properties of stretchable strain sensors, with a gauge factor of 634.12, an ultralow detection limit of 0.01%, and outstanding durability exceeding 15&#160;000 cycles. The demonstration of radial artery pulse and throat vibration applications highlights the IOHSDR's unique characteristics of isotropic omnidirectional sensing and precise direction detection unleashing new classes of wearable health monitoring devices.

         <title>Manipulating Molecular Stacking for Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics Achieving Light Utilization Efficiency &gt;6%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through delicate design of host&#8208;guest active layer, the hydrogen bonding interactions between host donor D18 and guest BTO&#8208;BO facilitate the formation of predominant J&#8208;type stacking of D18 during crystallization, significantly reducing visible absorption and enhancing hole transport. The resultant ST&#8208;OSCs with optical modulation achieved record light utilization efficiencies of 6.02%, while also demonstrating excellent flexibility and scalability.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE), governed by the molecular stacking of the donor and acceptor materials in semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs), significantly constrains improvements in light utilization efficiency (LUE). Here, simultaneous enhancement of AVT and PCE is achieved by meticulously designing host&#8208;guest active layers to fine&#8208;tune the molecular stacking. A systematic investigation of various host donor and guest material combinations reveals that the donor material (D18) with more electron&#8208;deficient hydrogen atoms tends to form C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions with the guest material (BTO&#8208;BO) that features electron&#8208;rich oxygen atoms. Hydrogen bonding interactions between host donor D18 and guest BTO&#8208;BO facilitate the transition from mixed J&#8208;type and H&#8208;type molecular stacking modes of the donor to predominant J&#8208;type stacking during crystallization, significantly reducing visible absorption and enhancing hole transport. Additionally, BTO&#8208;BO can act as a nucleation agent for the host acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9 to increase the crystallinity and absorption coefficient of the active layer, thereby, enhancing near&#8208;infrared light absorption. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed ST&#8208;OSCs with optical modulation exhibit simultaneous improvement in PCE and AVT, delivering record LUEs of 6.02%. Notably, this host&#8208;guest active layer demonstrates exceptional compatibility with flexible devices and promising scalability for greenhouse photovoltaic applications.

         <title>High Cell to Module Efficiency Remaining Ratio of &#8776;90% for the 100&#160;cm2 Fully Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Gravure Printed Flexible Organic Solar Cells From Non&#8208;Halogenated Solvent</title>

         <dc:description>
This work gives an insight into solvent&#8208;dependent rheology properties and phase separation dynamics for the R2R printing of flexible organic solar cells. With o&#8208;XY solvent, the fully R2R gravure&#8208;printed 1 and 28&#8211;104&#160;cm2 large&#8208;area modules give efficiencies of 14.67% and over 13%, respectively, with a high cell&#8208;to&#8208;module remaining ratio of 0.9 during upscaling.








Abstract
The cell&#8208;to&#8208;module (CTM) efficiency remaining ratio from monolithic device to large&#8208;area module indicates the scalability potential for large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs). Nowadays, the CTM value is still low as the area increases to larger than 100 cm2. In this work, the crucial role of solvent in CTM for printing, which on one side influenced the large area homogeneity due to the ink rheology property, and on the other side impacted phase separation dynamics because of vaporization and crystalline rate is highlighted. The films from TMB show excessive pure phase and printing line defects in vertical the printing direction due to slow volatilization speed and low adhesion, while Tol&#8208;based films present printing line defects along the printing direction due to large surface adhesion are demonstrated. In contrast, the films from non&#8208;halogenated solvent, o&#8208;XY exhibited a suitable phase separation size and excellent large&#8208;area homogeneity. Consequently, the fully printed 1&#160;cm2 FOSCs exhibit an efficiency of 14.81%. Moreover, the FOSCs module with an area of 28&#8211;104&#160;cm2 gives an efficiency of over 13%, with a CTM of 0.9. Selecting suitable non&#8208;halogenated solvents to achieve large&#8208;area uniformity and appropriate phase separation morphology in &gt;100&#160;cm2 modules is of great importance for the industrialization of FOSCs.

         <title>20.6% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Incorporating a Lower Bandgap Guest Nonfullerene Acceptor Without Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Expanding the sunlight harvesting spectrum while concurrently minimizing energy loss is crucial for high&#8208;performance OSCs. Herein, eC9, a nonfullerene acceptor with a narrower bandgap is introduced, as the guest component into the D18:AQx&#8208;2F binary system. This ternary strategy resulted in a broadened absorption window, enhanced crystallization, and reduced nonradiative loss, leading to a record efficiency of 20.6% with simultaneous enhancement in VOC, JSC, and FF.








Abstract
Simultaneously mitigating both photovoltage and photocurrent losses is crucial for organic solar cells (OSCs) to approach the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit of ideal efficiency. Incorporating a narrower bandgap nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) as a guest component into the host donor:NFA system broadens the absorption spectrum. However, this can also increase the nonradiative decay rate according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In this work, ternary OSCs are constructed by combining a narrow bandgap AQx&#8208;2F (as host NFA) with a lower bandgap eC9 (as guest NFA), significantly enhancing photocurrent generation without compromising photovoltage. The addition of eC9 acts as a crystallization inducer, extending the crystallization period and increasing the ordered packing distance. This leads to suppressed trap states, elevated dielectric constant, prolonged exciton lifetime, balanced hole/electron transport, and reduced recombination loss. Consequently, the optimized D18:AQx&#8208;2F:eC9 ternary OSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.6% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.937&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current density of 27.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a fill factor of 80.8%, as validated by an independently certified PCE of 20.0%, establishing a new benchmark for bulk heterojunction OSCs. This work demonstrates an effective method to simultaneously mitigate photovoltage and photocurrent losses, paving the way for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Highly Ordered Conductive Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Chemically Confined Polyoxometalate Clusters: A Dual&#8208;Functional Electrocatalyst for Efficient H2O2 Synthesis and Biomass Valorization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically bonded conductive metal&#8208;organic framework/polyoxometalate composites are synthesized as a high&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst through a conserved ligand replacement strategy. Excellent performances with a H2O2 production rate of 9.51&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and 2, 5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid yield of 96.8% are achieved in an integrated electrolysis system of two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction coupling with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The design of bifunctional and high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that can be used as both cathodes and anodes for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) and biomass valorization is attracting increasing attention. Herein, a conserved ligand replacement strategy is developed for the synthesis of highly ordered conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;HITP, HITP = 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene) with chemically confined phosphotungstic acid (PW12) nanoclusters in the nanopores. The newly formed Ni&#8722;O&#8722;W bonds in the resultant Ni&#8208;HITP/PW12 electrocatalysts modulate the electronic structures of both Ni and W sites, which are favorable for cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR to H2O2 production and anodic 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) to 2, 5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), respectively. In combination with the deliberately retained conductive frameworks and ordered pores, the dual&#8208;functional Ni&#8208;HITP/PW12 composites enable a H2O2 production rate of 9.51&#160;mol&#160;gcat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and an FDCA yield of 96.8% at a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2/cell voltage of 1.38&#160;V in an integrated 2e&#8722; ORR/HMFOR system, significantly improved than the traditional 2e&#8722; ORR/oxygen evolution reaction system. This work has provided new insights into the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts and electrocatalytic systems for the green synthesis of valuable chemicals.

         <title>Constructing Biomimetic Nanochannels for High&#8208;Capacity Capture of Uranyl Tricarbonate Complex Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2&#8211;8.4 &#197; are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework to obtain biomimetic nanochannels for [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ions. The unique structure enabled a selective capture of [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in 35 days.








Abstract
Biomimetic nanochannels enable fast and selective transport of mononuclear metal ions; however, their construction for complex ion transport remains in its infancy due to the nonuniform charge distribution and large geometric dimensions of coordination compounds. Herein, an ionic electrostatic interaction template strategy is proposed to prepare biomimetic channels for the capture of complex ions. Using the [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ion as a template, various quaternary ammonium monomers with lengths of 6.2&#8722;8.4 &#197; are decorated on 1D porous channels of the TpBDOH framework via the Williamson ether reaction. Accordingly, the pore size is modulated in the sub&#8208;nanometer range of 9&#8722;13 &#197;, facilitating multiple electrostatic attractions between quaternary ammonium fragments and the three equatorial carbonate ions on the [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ion. The unique structure enabled highly efficient uranium adsorption with a capacity of 501.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1 and a high selectivity coefficient for uranium over vanadium of &gt;163.1. The resulting electropositive nanochannels selectively captured [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; ions from natural seawater, achieving a high uptake of 25.3&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in 35 days.

         <title>Triplet State Suppression for Energy Loss Reduction in 20% Nonhalogenated Solvent Processed Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric small molecule acceptor with a methoxylated end group is produced here, whose oxygen vibration is found effective in suppressing triplet state formation, thereby minimizing non&#8208;radiative energy loss for 20% efficiency in nonhalogenated solvent cast binary organic solar cells.









Abstract
Boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has been restricted by its undesirably high energy loss, especially for those nonhalogenated solvent&#8208;processed ones. Here,a dichloro&#8208;methoxylated terminal group in an asymmetric small molecular acceptor design, which realizes a significantly reduced non&#8208;radiative energy loss (0.179&#160;eV) compared to its symmetric counterpart (0.202&#160;eV), is reported. Consequently, the device efficiency is improved by up to 20% for PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4ClO, without sacrificing the photon harvest or charge transport ability of the control system PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9. Further characterizations reveal the asymmetric acceptor BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4ClO's blend film demonstrates a suppressed triplet state formation, enabled by an enhanced electron delocalization. In addition, the asymmetric BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4ClO is found to be thermally stabler than BTP&#8208;eC9, and thus providing an improved device stability, whose T80 value reaches &gt; 7800 h under 80&#160;&#176;C anneal in N2 via linear extrapolation. This work represents state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performance for nonhalogenated solvent&#8208;processed binary OSCs with certified results (19.45%).

         <title>Multi&#8208;Objective Optimization of Ionic Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Fast&#8208;Charging and Versatile Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study employs multi&#8208;objective kernel&#8208;based Bayesian optimization to efficiently screen ionic polymer electrolytes (IPEs) for high&#8208;voltage, fast&#8208;charging lithium metal batteries (LMBs). By examining just 2.8% of the complex chemical space, it achieves multi&#8208;objective optimization for ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and capacity in IPEs. These findings highlight the pivotal role of machine learning in expediting material discovery for advanced batteries.








Abstract
Designing ionic polymer electrolytes (IPEs) for high&#8208;voltage and fast&#8208;charging lithium batteries involves searching in a highly complex and discrete chemical space. Traditional material discovery processes struggle with this complexity due to high costs and long evaluation time. A kernel&#8208;based Bayesian optimization is described to complete the multi&#8208;objective optimization by considering ionic conductivity, electrochemical stability, and discharge capacity simultaneously. According to a recommender based on a union set of acquisition functions, promising IPEs through three iterations with only 2.8% of the chemical space is targeted. The achieved lithium metal batteries exhibit promising performance with ultrahigh cutoff voltage with NCM811 (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, 4.8&#160;V) and LNMO (LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, 4.92&#160;V). To further extend the versatility of IPEs and diminish the high cost associated with the glove&#8208;box environment, an aqueous and high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;ion battery is developed by introducing water molecules in IPEs coupled with Li4Ti5O12||LiMn2O4, a strong hydrogen bonding network formed between the rigid&#8208;rod polyelectrolyte and the embedded water molecules, which effectively suppresses the water reactivity, meanwhile boosting the ionic conductivity. This work reveals an innovative multi&#8208;objective optimization that effectively handles multi&#8208;targets and discontinuous parameter space, offering critical insights to address complex challenges in material discovery and property optimization for advanced and versatile lithium batteries.

This work reveals an innovative multi-objective optimization that effectively handles multi-targets and discontinuous parameter space, offering critical insights to address complex challenges in material discovery and property optimization for advanced and versatile lithium batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exploring the Mechanisms of Charge Transfer and Identifying Active Sites in the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Using Hollow C@MoS2&#8208;Au@CdS Nanostructures as Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer mechanism and hydrogen evolution reaction photocatalytic reaction mechanism are determined by using transient absorption spectrum, electromagnetic simulation, in situ Raman, and density functional theory theoretical calculation.








Abstract
Plasmonic metal&#8211;semiconductor nanocomposites are promising candidates for considerably enhancing the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts across the entire solar spectrum. However, the underlying enhancement mechanism remains unclear, and the overall efficiency is still low. Herein, a hollow C@MoS2&#8208;Au@CdS nanocomposite photocatalyst is developed to achieve improved photocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) across a broad spectral range. Transient absorption spectroscopy experiments and electromagnetic field simulations demonstrate that compared to the treated sample, the untreated sample exhibits a high density of sulfur vacancies. Consequently, under near&#8208;field enhancement, photogenerated electrons from CdS and hot electrons generated by intra&#8208;band or inter&#8208;band transitions of Au nanoparticles are efficiently transferred to the CdS surface, thus significantly improving the HER activity of CdS. Additionally, in situ, Raman spectroscopy provided spectral evidence of S&#9472;H intermediate species on the CdS surface during the HER process, which is verified through isotope experiments. Density functional theory simulations identify sulfur atoms in CdS as the catalytic active sites for HER. These findings enhance the understanding of charge transfer mechanisms and HER pathways, offering valuable insights for the design of plasmonic photocatalysts with enhanced efficiency.

         <title>Oriented Assembly of 2D Metal&#8208;Pyridylporphyrinic Framework to Regulate the Redox Kinetics in Li&#8722;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By connecting CoTPyP blocks with transition metal nodes, a class of bimetallic 2D MOFs are designed and synthesized. The prepared CoTPyP&#8208;M MOFs enhanced the utilization of sulfur and smoothed the lithium deposition/stripping process. The central Co sites display strong interactions with sulfur species through Co&#8722;S and Li&#8722;N bonds, facilitating the cleavage of S&#8722;S bond from both ends and promoting their conversion kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
Developing the highly efficient catalysts is a great challenge for accelerating the redox reactions in Li&#8722;S batteries. Inspired by the single&#8208;atom catalysts and metalloproteins, it makes full use of the advantages of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as electrocatalysts. Herein, a series of 2D metal&#8208;bonded metalloporphyrin MOFs are prepared with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl) cobalt porphyrin (CoTPyP) as building blocks and transition metals (M&#9552;Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) as nodes, respectively. The crystalline structures of the bimetallic 2D MOFs are confirmed by UV&#8211;vis spectra and X&#8208;ray diffraction analyses. According to DFT calculation, the peripheral metal nodes optimize the electronic state of Co in porphyrin core. Especially, CoTPyP&#8208;Mn facilitates the cleavage of S&#8722;S bond from both ends and promotes their conversion kinetics through Co&#8722;S and Li&#8722;N bonds. The Li&#8722;S cells with CoTPyP&#8208;Mn show the initial specific capacity of 1339&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C. The capacity decay rate is only 0.0442% per cycle after 1000 cycles at 2 C. This work achieves the rational control of the central Co d electron state through the peripheral regulation and enriches the application of MOFs in accelerating the redox kinetics in Li&#8722;S batteries.

         <title>Electromagnetically Heating and Oscillating Liquid Metal for Catalyzing Polyester Depolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal alloys provide dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, spontaneous metal enriching, and oxidation within their surface layers. Under alternating electromagnetic fields, these alloys can serve as the efficient self&#8208;heater, mechanic disturber, and catalyst for thermolysis depolymerization of polycaprolactone with a rate &#8776;700 mg h&#8722;1 mL&#8722;1 and monomer selectivity &#8776;95.5%, offering an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; platform for continuous polyester depolymerization.








Abstract
Depolymerization and recycling of polyesters have shown great significance to economy, ecology, carbon neutrality and human health. Efficient catalysts for thermolysis depolymerization have long been pursued to achieve rapid depolymerization, high selectivity, and low energy consumption. In this study, it is found that liquid metal (LM) can serve as the efficient self&#8208;heater, mechanic disturber and catalyst for thermolysis depolymerization of polyesters under alternating electromagnetic fields. When dissolving different metals (e.g., Sn, Zn, Al, and Mg) into gallium, LMs may provide dynamic interactions between the catalyst and reactants, spontaneous metal enriching, and oxidation within the LM surface layer. Without any conventional heaters and mechanic shakers, polycaprolactone is catalytically depolymerized into &#603;&#8208;caprolactone at the rate of &#8776;700&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mL&#8722;1 with the selectivity of 95.5%. The high surface tension and high mobility of LM also enable continuous depolymerization at an appropriate feeding speed of polyesters (including polyethylene terephthalate, polyhydroxybutyrate and polylactic acid). Thus, this study may offer an unprecedented &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; platform of liquid metal for continuous thermolysis depolymerization of polyesters, while without any requirement of external heater, mixer, and catalysts.

         <title>Cluster&#8208;Scale Multisite Interface Reinforces Ruthenium&#8208;Based Anode Catalysts for Alkaline Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strongly coupled multisite anode electrocatalyst with cluster&#8208;scale ruthenium&#8208;tungsten oxide (Ru&#8208;WOx) interface is developed for alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), which could simultaneously achieve high coverage of hydroxyl (OHad) and hydrogen (Had) at Ru and WOx domains, respectively. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm&#8722;2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm&#8722;2 and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is a more cost&#8208;effective alternative to platinum anode catalysts for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), but suffers from severe competitive adsorption of hydrogen (Had) and hydroxyl (OHad). To address this concern, a strongly coupled multisite electrocatalyst with highly active cluster&#8208;scale ruthenium&#8208;tungsten oxide (Ru&#8208;WOx) interface, which could eliminate the competitive adsorption phenomenon and achieve high coverage of OHad and Had at Ru and WOx domains, respectively, is designed. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that WOx domain functions as a proton sponge to perpetually accommodate the activated hydrogen species that spillover from the adjacent Ru domain, and the resulting WO&#8208;Had species are readily coupled with Ru&#8208;OHad at the heterointerface to finish the hydrogen oxidation reaction with faster kinetics via the thermodynamically favorable Tafel&#8208;Volmer mechanism. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm&#8722;2 with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mgRu cm&#8722;2 and outstanding durability (negligible voltage decay over 80&#8208;h operation at 500&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work offers completely new insights into understanding the alkaline HOR mechanism and designing advanced anode catalysts for AEMFCs.

The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that WO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; domain functions as a proton sponge to perpetually accommodate the activated hydrogen species that spillover from the adjacent Ru domain, and the resulting WO-H&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; species are readily coupled with Ru-OH&lt;sub&gt;ad&lt;/sub&gt; at the heterointerface to finish the hydrogen oxidation reaction with faster kinetics via the thermodynamically favorable Tafel-Volmer mechanism. The AEMFC delivers a high peak power density of 1.36 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a low anode catalyst loading of 0.05 mg&lt;sub&gt;Ru&lt;/sub&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and outstanding durability (negligible voltage decay over 80-h operation at 500&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This work offers completely new insights into understanding the alkaline HOR mechanism and designing advanced anode catalysts for AEMFCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>p&#8208;&#960; Conjugated Covalent Organic Frameworks Expedite Molecular Triplet Excitons for H2O2 Production Coupled with Biomass Upgrading</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fluorinated olefin&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework photocatalyst is developed. The adjacent fluorine atom&#8208;olefinic bond forms p&#8211;&#960; conjugation and expedites triplet excitons for activating O2 to 1O2 while accelerating charge separation, thus leading to high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic O2 reduction to H2O2 and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural photo&#8208;oxidation upgrading.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency production of triplet states in covalent organic framework photocatalysts is crucial for high&#8208;selectivity oxygen (O2)&#160;reduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, fluorine and partial fluorine atoms are incorporated into an olefin&#8208;linked triazine covalent organic framework (F&#8208;ol&#8208;COF and HF&#8208;ol&#8208;COF), in which the adjacent fluorine (F) atoms&#8208;olefinic bond forms p&#8208;&#960; conjugation that induces spin&#8208;polarization under irradiation, thus expediting triplet excitons for activating O2 to singlet oxygen (1O2) and contributing to a high H2O2 selectivity (91%). Additionally, the feasibility of coupling H2O2 production with the valorization of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is exhibited. The F&#8208;ol&#8208;COF demonstrates a highly stable H2O2 yield rate of 12558&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with the HMF&#8208;to&#8208;functionalized furan conversion yield of 95%, much higher than the partially fluorinated COF (HF&#8208;ol&#8208;COF) and the non&#8208;fluorinated COF (H&#8208;ol&#8208;COF). Mechanistic studies reveal that F&#8208;incorporation promotes charge separation, intensifies the Lewis acidity of the carbon atoms on the olefinic bond as active sites for O2 adsorption, and provides highly concentrated holes at the triazine unit for HMF oxidation upgrading. This study suggests the attractive potential of rational design of porous&#8208;crystalline photocatalysts for high&#8208;efficiency photocatalytic O2 reduction to H2O2 and biomass upgrading.

         <title>Preventing Benzoquinone&#8208;Based Catalyst Aggregation Enables the One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Highly Conductive Poly(benzodifurandione) without Post&#8208;Reaction Purification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>

&#945;&#8208;Tocopherylquinone (&#945;&#8208;TQ), the oxidation product of &#945;&#8208;tocopherol (&#945;&#8208;TOH), catalyzes the oxidative polymerization of 3,7&#8208;dihydrobenzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]difuran&#8208;2,6&#8208;dione (HBFDO). The saturated aliphatic chiral side chain of &#945;&#8208;TQ suppresses its crystallization, enabling high&#8208;conductivity polymer ink without needing post&#8208;polymerization dialysis. This scalable method, tested in a 20 L reactor, yields ready&#8208;to&#8208;use poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) ink.








Abstract
Conductive polymers have become crucial in advancing various electronic applications. While p&#8208;type materials like poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) are widely used and produced at scale, the development of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers has lagged due to challenges in synthesis and scalability. In this work, a novel method is introduced to synthesize the highly conductive n&#8208;type polymer poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) using &#945;&#8208;tocopherylquinone (&#945;&#8208;TQ) as a catalyst. This approach eliminates the need for post&#8208;reaction dialysis, a major obstacle to large&#8208;scale PBFDO production. By preventing catalyst aggregation, high electrical conductivity (&gt;1320 S cm&#8722;1) is achieved, which remains stable in air for over 180 d, significantly simplifying the process. The &#945;&#8208;TQ&#8208;synthesized PBFDO also exhibits excellent thermoelectric properties, with a power factor exceeding 100 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, placing it among the highest&#8208;performing n&#8208;type thermoelectric polymers. Additionally, residual &#945;&#8208;TQ acts as a plasticizer, reducing the elastic modulus by over tenfold while maintaining high conductivity, making this material suitable for mechanically compliant electronics. Similarly, residual &#945;&#8208;TQ lowers the thermal conductivity of PBFDO by more than an order of magnitude. The process is scalable, as demonstrated by producing high&#8208;conductivity ink in a 20 L reactor. This work presents an efficient and sustainable approach for large&#8208;scale n&#8208;type polymer production.

         <title>Organic Photoelectrochemical Multisensory Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports an OPECT&#8208;based chemical MSI with multisensory perception, multimodal synaptic plasticity, and typical MSI features in electrolytes. The advanced MSI device is then used to mimic the associative learning and reflex activities of visual and gustatory stimuli with the associated feedback loops. This work may provide new insight into the development of highly biomimetic MSI in biological fluids for seamless neuro&#8208;robotic systems.









Abstract
Neuromorphic perception capable of multisensory integration (MSI) in electrolytes is important but remains challenging. Here, the aqueous implementation of artificial MSI is reported based on the newly emerged organic photoelectrochemical transistor (OPECT) by representative visual (light)&#8208;gustatory (sour) perception. Under the co&#8208;modulation of light and H+/OH&#8722;, multisensory synaptic plasticity and several typical MSI characteristics are mimicked, including &#8220;super&#8208;additive response,&#8221; &#8220;inverse effectiveness effect&#8221; and &#8220;temporal congruency.&#8221; To demonstrate its potential usage, different types of multisensory associative learning and corresponding reflex activities are further emulated. The chemical MSI system is also utilized to control artificial salivation by a closed loop of real&#8208;time perception, processing, integration, and actuation to emulate the biological responses toward external stimuli. In contrast to previous solid&#8208;state operations, this work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic MSI in aqueous environments that are analogous to those in biology.

         <title>Metalloenzyme&#8208;Inspired Cluster Fabrication within Mesoporous Channels Featuring Optimized Catalytic Microenvironments for Efficient Neutral pH H2O2 Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by some metalloenzymes, bismuth metal clusters are used as active sites and coupled with mesoporous channels to create a favorable catalytic microenvironment, enabling efficient electrocatalysis of the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction in neutral media, with an industrially relevant current density and an exceptional H2O2 production rate of 21.4 mol gcatalyst&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 over 120 h.








Abstract
In nature, some metalloenzymes facilitate highly efficient catalytic transformations of small molecules, primarily attributed to the effective coupling between their metal cluster active sites and the surrounding microenvironment.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by some metalloenzymes, bismuth metal clusters are used as active sites and coupled with mesoporous channels to create a favorable catalytic microenvironment, enabling efficient electrocatalysis of the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction in neutral media, with an industrially relevant current density and an exceptional H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 21.4 mol g&lt;sub&gt;catalyst&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nature, some metalloenzymes facilitate highly efficient catalytic transformations of small molecules, primarily attributed to the effective coupling between their metal cluster active sites and the surrounding microenvironment. Inspired by this, a thermotropic redispersion strategy to incorporate bismuth nanoclusters (Bi NCs) into mesoporous channels, mimicking metalloenzyme-like catalysis to enhance the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR) for efficient neutral pH H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrosynthesis, is developed. This model electrocatalyst exhibits exceptional 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR performance with &amp;gt;95% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity across 0.2&#8211;0.6 V vs RHE in neutral electrolyte. Notably, the system produces up to 7.2 wt% neutral H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solution at an industrially relevant current density of &#8776;320 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with 90% Faradaic efficiency for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over 120 h in a flow cell, demonstrating significant practical potential.

         <title>A Polymeric mRNA Vaccine Featuring Enhanced Site&#8208;Specific mRNA Delivery and Inherent STING&#8208;Stimulating Performance for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
POctS is an innovative, simple to prepare mRNA delivery carrier that has both high mRNA delivery efficiency and stimulator of interferon genes (STING)&#8208;stimulating function. More importantly, the unique site&#8208;specific delivery ability of POctS achieves mRNA expression in specific sites and the exertion of STING&#8208;stimulating function in specific sites, resulting in minimization of formulation toxicity and maximization of mRNA vaccine efficacy.








Abstract
The development of mRNA delivery carriers with innate immune stimulation functions has emerged as a focal point in the field of mRNA vaccines. Nonetheless, the expression of mRNA in specific sites and innate immune stimulation at specific sites are prerequisites for ensuring the safety of mRNA vaccines. Based on the synthetic PEIRs carriers library, this study identifies an innovative mRNA delivery carrier named POctS with the following characteristics: 1) simultaneously possessing high mRNA delivery efficiency and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) stimulation function. 2) Leveraging the distinctive site&#8208;specific delivery capabilities of POctS, the expression of mRNA at specific sites and the activation of innate immune responses at designated sites are achieved, minimizing formulation toxicity and maximizing the vaccine performance. 3) Tailoring two types of mRNA vaccines based on POctS according to the immune infiltration status of different types of tumors. Briefly, POctS&#8208;loading ovalbumin (OVA) mRNA as a tumor antigen vaccine achieves the prevention and treatment of melanoma in mice. Further, POctS&#8208;loading mixed lineage kinase domain&#8208;like protein (MLKL) mRNA as an in situ tumor vaccine effectively treats orthotopic pancreatic cancer in mice. This delivery carrier offers a feasible mRNA vaccine&#8208;based immunotherapy strategy for various types of tumors.

         <title>Gradient&#8208;Metasurface&#8208;Contact Photodetector for Visible&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Spin Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents the design and functionality of a gradient&#8208;metasurface&#8208;contact CPL photodetector that operates at zero bias, offering a high discrimination ratio (&#8776;1.6 &#10007; 104), broadband response (500&#8211;1100&#160;nm), and immunity to non&#8208;CPL fields. By integrating InSe flakes with CPL&#8208;selective metasurface contacts, it achieves CPL&#8208;dependent vectorial photocurrents. Additionally, its application in multivalued logic and CPL&#8208;encrypted communication showcases its potential in advanced on&#8208;chip polarization detection systems.








Abstract
Spin light detection is a rapidly advancing field with significant impact on diverse applications in biology, medicine, and photonics. Developing integrated circularly polarized light (CPL) detectors is pivotal for next&#8208;generation compact polarimeters. However, previous compact CPL detectors, based on natural materials or artificial resonant nanostructures, exhibit intrinsically weak CPL polarization sensitivity, are susceptible to other polarization states, and suffer from limited bandwidths. A gradient&#8208;metasurface&#8208;contact CPL photodetector is demonstrated operating at zero&#8208;bias with a high discrimination ratio (&#8776;1.6 &#10007; 104), broadband response (500&#8211;1100&#160;nm), and immunity to non&#8208;CPL field components. The photodetector integrates InSe flakes with CPL&#8208;selective metasurface contacts, forming an asymmetric junction interface driven by CPL&#8208;dependent unidirectional propagating surface plasmon waves, generating zero&#8208;bias vectorial photocurrents. Furthermore, it is implemented the developed CPL photodetector in a multivalued logic system and demonstrated the optical decoding of CPL&#8208;encrypted communication signals. This metasurface contact engineering represents a new paradigm in light property detection, paving the way for future integrated optoelectronic systems for on&#8208;chip polarization detection.

         <title>Anion Vacancies Coupling with Heterostructures Enable Advanced Aerogel Cathode for Ultrafast Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by DFT calculations, a novel 3D sulfur vacancy&#8208;rich and heterostructured MnS/MXene aerogel is designed based on the synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures, and utilized as a cathode for ZIBs/ZICs for the first time, achieving significantly enhanced electrochemical performance. Meanwhile, systematic kinetic analyses, ex situ characterizations, and DFT calculations are utilized to reveal the phase transition mechanism.








Abstract
As a potential cathode material, manganese&#8208;based sulfide has recently attracted increasing interest due to its many advantages in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion storage. Unfortunately, some challenges such as sluggish kinetics, unstable structure, and controversial phase transition mechanism during the energy storage process hinder its practical application. Herein, inspired by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a novel 3D sulfur vacancy&#8208;rich and heterostructured MnS/MXene aerogel is designed, and used as a cathode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries/hybrid capacitors (ZIBs/ZICs) for the first time. Thanks to the synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures, the as&#8208;constructed MnS/MXene//Zn ZIBs exhibit significantly enhanced electrochemical properties, especially outstanding rate capability and cyclic stability. More encouragingly, the as&#8208;assembled MnS/MXene//porous carbon (PC) ZICs exhibit an ultrahigh energy density, a high power density, and a splendid cycling lifespan. Most notably, systematic kinetic analyses, ex situ characterizations, and DFT calculations illustrate that MnS/MXene first irreversibly converts into MnOx@ZnMnO3/MXene, and then undergoes a reversible conversion from MnOx@ZnMnO3/MXene to MnOOH@ZnMn2O4/MXene, accompanied by the co&#8208;insertion/extraction of H+ and Zn2+. The synergistic modification strategy of sulfur vacancies and heterostructures and the thorough mechanistic study proposed in this work offer valuable guidance for designing and exploiting high&#8208;performance cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Quantum Batteries: A Materials Science Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective is focused on advanced materials that might allow the new device class of quantum batteries to be developed. These systems include microcavities with organic molecules, inorganic nanostructures and perovskites, and superconductor circuits. The different systems proposed are introduced and discussed, and an overview of the potential material platforms for the experimental realization is presented.








Abstract
In the context of quantum thermodynamics, quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices for energy storage and manipulation. Over the past decade, substantial progress is made in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum batteries, with several experimental implementations showing great promise. This perspective provides an overview of the solid&#8208;state materials platforms that can lead to fully operational quantum batteries. After briefly introducing the basic features of quantum batteries, organic microcavities are discussed, where superextensive charging is already demonstrated experimentally. Now, this explores other materials, including inorganic nanostructures (such as quantum wells and dots), perovskite systems, and (normal and high&#8208;temperature) superconductors.

&lt;p&gt;This perspective is focused on advanced materials that might allow the new device class of quantum batteries to be developed. These systems include microcavities with organic molecules, inorganic nanostructures and perovskites, and superconductor circuits. The different systems proposed are introduced and discussed, and an overview of the potential material platforms for the experimental realization is presented.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of quantum thermodynamics, quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices for energy storage and manipulation. Over the past decade, substantial progress is made in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum batteries, with several experimental implementations showing great promise. This perspective provides an overview of the solid-state materials platforms that can lead to fully operational quantum batteries. After briefly introducing the basic features of quantum batteries, organic microcavities are discussed, where superextensive charging is already demonstrated experimentally. Now, this explores other materials, including inorganic nanostructures (such as quantum wells and dots), perovskite systems, and (normal and high-temperature) superconductors. Key achievements in these areas, relevant to the experimental realization of quantum batteries, are highlighted. The challenges and future research directions are also addressed. Despite their enormous potential for energy storage devices, research into advanced materials for quantum batteries is still in its infancy. This paper aims to stimulate interdisciplinarity and convergence among different materials science research communities to accelerate the development of new materials and device architectures for quantum batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling Interlayer Interactions Boosts Charge Separation in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Efficiency Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The weak interlayer coupling suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electron and hole, facilitating charge separation. The optimized PY&#8208;CN&#8208;BIP&#8208;Ni achieves 553.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8315;&#185; h&#8315;&#185; CO production (94% selectivity), eightfold faster than its isomer with strong interlayer interactions under visible light.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising photocatalysts owing to their structural diversity, tunable bandgaps, and exceptional light&#8208;harvesting capabilities. While previous studies primarily focus on developing narrow&#8208;bandgap COFs for broad&#8208;spectrum solar energy utilization, the critical role of interlayer coupling in regulating charge transfer dynamics remains unclear. Conventional monolayer&#8208;based theoretical models inadequately address interlayer effects that potentially hindering intralayer electron transport to catalytic active sites. This work employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the influence of interlayer interactions on intralayer charge transfer in imine&#8208;based COFs. Theoretical analyses reveal that bilayer architectures exhibit pronounced interlayer interference in intramolecular charge transfer processes which has not been observed in monolayer models. Based on these mechanistic insights, this work designs two isomeric pyrene&#8208;based COFs incorporating identical electron donor (pyrene) and acceptor (nickel bipyridine) units but with distinct interlayer coupling strengths. Strikingly, the optimized COF with weakened interlayer interactions demonstrates exceptional photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance, achieving a CO evolution rate of 553.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 with 94% selectivity under visible light irradiation without additional photosensitizers or co&#8208;catalysts. These findings establish interlayer engineering as a crucial design principle for developing high&#8208;performance COF&#8208;based photocatalysts for solar energy conversion applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Lead&#8208;Free Ceramics With Simultaneously High Piezoelectricity and High Mechanical Quality Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are critical for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between d33 and Qm. This work reports a novel strategy involving the introduction of defect dipoles into quadruple point compositions to break the conventional trade&#8208;off and simultaneously enhance d33 to 710 pC/N and Qm to 929 in designed lead&#8208;free piezoelectric materials.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials with a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and high mechanical quality factor (Qm) are vital for advanced high&#8208;power applications. However, achieving this combination is challenging, particularly for lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics, because a high d33 value relies on mobile domain walls, which increase dissipative losses and reduce Qm. In this study, this longstanding trade&#8208;off is overcome by introducing defect dipoles (via Mn doping) into the quadruple point (QP) composition of the lead&#8208;free Ba(Sn, Ti)O3 system. The resultant 0.5%Mn&#8208;doped Ba(Sn0.11Ti0.89)O3 (BST&#8208;0.5%Mn) ceramic exhibits a high d33 value of 710 pC/N and high Qm value of 929, while the BST&#8208;1%Mn ceramic achieves a d33 value of 614 pC/N and Qm value of 1138. These values represent a 10&#8208;fold increase in Qm and 1.6&#8208;fold increase in d33 for BST&#8208;0.5%Mn, compared to those for undoped BST. High&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulations reveal that the enhanced d33 and Qm are attributable to the coexistence of multiple phases of QPs with symmetry&#8208;conforming defect dipoles, challenging the long&#8208;held notion of physical incompatibility between high d33 and high Qm. These findings offer a pathway for designing eco&#8208;friendly piezoelectric materials with unprecedented performance, paving the way for sustainable and efficient high&#8208;power applications.

         <title>Superior Energy Storage Performance in a Self&#8208;Organized Trirelaxor&#8208;Antiferroelectric Nanocomposite Over a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;organized nanocomposite addresses the challenge of energy storage materials degrading at high temperatures. The nanocomposite maintains exceptional performance from room temperature to 200&#160;&#176;C, with enhanced energy density and efficiency. Through the trirelaxor matrix and nanointerface with antiferroelectric nanoparticles, it offers a promising strategy for high&#8208;temperature dielectric energy storage, overcoming polarization and breakdown degradation at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
A fundamental paradox in energy storage dielectrics lies in the challenge of achieving superior performance consistently across both room and elevated temperatures. This is addressed by designing a self&#8208;organized nanocomposite (1&#8722;x)(Ba,Sr)(Ti,Sn)O3&#8208;xBi1.5ZnNb1.5O7 composed of nano&#8208;sized antiferroelectric(AFE) particles embedded into a trirelaxor(TRE) matrix through nanoscale phase separation process. The optimal composition at x = 0.11 exhibits outstanding energy storage performance from room temperature (energy density = 8.5 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency = 94.8%, and figure of merit of 167 J&#160;cm&#8722;3) up to 200&#160;&#176;C (energy density = 4.85 J&#160;cm&#8722;3, efficiency &gt;90% and figure of merit of 49 J&#160;cm&#8722;3), outperforming existing Pb&#8208;free dielectrics. High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron x&#8208;ray diffractometry reveal that the coexisting nanometric antiferroelectric particles and the trirelaxor nanodomains sustain over a wide temperature range. Piezoresponse force microscopy and phase&#8208;field simulation show that hysteresis&#8208;free switching of trirelaxor nanodomains enables enhanced polarization and low hysteretic loss. Resistivity shows a 2&#8211;3 order of magnitude increases accompanying significant increase in breakdown strength up to high temperatures, attributable to deep charge trapping effect at high&#8208;density TRE/AFE interfaces as evidenced by thermally stimulated depolarization current. These favorable effects in the nano&#8208;composite are responsible for its high energy storage performance up to high temperatures.

         <title>Cost&#8208;Effective Symmetric PbSe&#8208;Based Device for Thermoelectric Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from seven pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type), which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8, 36.9, and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303, 323, and 343 K, respectively.








Abstract
Thermoelectric cooling technology has broad applications but is limited by the high cost of tellurium (Te) in commercially available Bi2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectric materials. Herein, a cost&#8208;effective symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device constructed from 7 pairs of Pb0.988Cu0.002Se (p&#8208;type) and Pb1.02Cu0.002Se (n&#8208;type) is presented, which demonstrates impressive cooling temperature difference (&#916;TC) of 32.8 and 41.0 K with the hot side maintained at 303 and 343 K, respectively. This low&#8208;cost symmetric PbSe&#8208;based device exhibits superior cost&#8208;effectiveness (&#916;T/cost) for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature thermoelectric cooling compared to other Bi2Te3&#8208;based devices. Its high cooling performance primarily stems from an advanced carrier and phonon transport properties in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se. Specifically, Pb vacancy and Cu substitution in Pb0.988Cu0.002Se act as strong p&#8208;type dopants that effectively optimize carrier density, resulting in a maximum power factor of 28.69 &#181;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, the mobile Cu atoms within the lattice significantly impede phonon propagation, leading to a low room&#8208;temperature lattice thermal conductivity of 1.10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Finally, the room&#8208;temperature figure of merit (ZT) and average ZT value in p&#8208;type Pb0.988Cu0.002Se can reach 0.6 and 0.68 at 300&#8211;573 K, surpassing previous p&#8208;type PbSe&#8208;based polycrystals. This work emphasizes the significant potential of a cost&#8208;effective PbSe compound for near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature cooling applications.

&lt;p&gt;Thermoelectric cooling technology has broad applications but is limited by the high cost of tellurium (Te) in commercially available Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Selective Urea Electrosynthesis from CO2 and Nitrate on Spin&#8208;Polarized Atomically Ordered PdCuCo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically ordered, spin&#8208;polarized Co&#8208;doped PdCu intermetallic compound is rationally synthesized. The introduction of spin&#8208;polarized Co atoms can enhance the *NO binding and hydrogenation on its N&#8208;side to form *HNO, which further produces *NH2OH. The subsequent coupling of *CO and *NH2OH leads to the efficient and stable formation of urea.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of NO3&#8722; and CO2 into urea features a potential means of reducing carbon footprint and generating value&#8208;added chemicals. Nonetheless, due to the limited efficiency of carbon&#8722;nitrogen (C&#9472;N) coupling and the competing side reaction that forms ammonia, the urea selectivity and production yield have remained low. In this work, a spin&#8722;polarized cobalt&#8722;doped, atomically ordered PdCu intermetallic compound (denoted as PdCuCo) is developed as an efficient urea electrosynthesis catalyst. The Pd and Cu serve as the adsorption sites for CO2 and NO3&#8722;, respectively, and the spin&#8722;polarized Co sites promote the adsorption of *NO intermediate, followed by hydrogenation of *NO at its N&#8722;terminal to form *HNO, instead of at its O&#8722;terminal. The difference in the hydrogenation position switches the subsequent reaction pathway to produce urea, in contrast to the PdCu or Ni&#8722;doped PdCu intermetallic compounds with main product selectivity of ammonia. The PdCuCo electrocatalyst exhibited an outstanding electrosynthesis of urea from NO3&#8722; and CO2, including a Faradaic efficiency of 81%, a high urea yield of 227&#160;mmol gcat.&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and a notable electrochemical stability of &gt;260 h, suggesting the attractive potential of designing spin&#8722;polarized catalytic sites for carbon&#8722;nitrogen coupling processes.

         <title>Nanofibrous Guidance Conduits with Multiple Gradient Cues for Spinal Cord Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel guidance conduits are fabricated through electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, integrating topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues to promote cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation, and axonal extension. In rat models, these conduits inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, and promoted neuronal regeneration, significantly improving functional recovery and offering a promising strategy for spinal cord injury treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition that leads to severe disabilities and imposes significant economic and social burdens. Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on symptom management, with limited success in promoting full neurological recovery. In response to this challenge, the design of novel guidance conduits incorporating multiple gradient cues, inspired is reported by biological processes, to enhance spinal cord repair. These conduits are fabricated using electrospinning and masked coaxial electrospraying, a simple yet effective method that integrates topological, haptotactic, and chemotactic cues into a single scaffold. The synergy of these cues significantly promoted cell migration, neural stem cell differentiation into neurons, and axonal extension, resulting in substantial improvements in spinal cord regeneration and functional recovery in a rat model. Single&#8208;nucleus RNA sequencing further demonstrated that the guidance conduit inhibited fibroblast proliferation, preserved microglial homeostasis, restored cellular proportions, and facilitated the regeneration of neuronal axons, dendrites, and synapses. This work presents an innovative, versatile platform for fabricating tissue scaffolds that integrate multiple gradient cues, offering a promising strategy for SCI treatment and broader tissue regeneration applications.

         <title>Structurally Colored Sustainable Sea Silk from Atrina pectinata</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research, highlighting i) the hierarchical assembly of Photonins, ii) the sugar&#8211;lectin binding which modulates structural stability and mechanical properties of sea silk, and iii) the use of golden sea silk as a photonic protein fiber.








Abstract
The harvesting of sea silk, a luxurious golden textile traditionally obtained from the endangered mollusk Pinna nobilis, faces severe limitations due to conservation efforts, driving the search for sustainable alternatives. Atrina pectinata, a phylogenetically close relative within the Pinnidae family is identified, as a viable source of biomimetic sea silk. The byssal threads of A. pectinata can be processed using existing methods, providing a way to continue producing this historically significant textile. These threads exhibit a remarkable hierarchical structure with globular proteins organized across multiple scales and stabilized by supramolecular sugar&#8208;lectin interactions that influence their mechanical properties. Moreover, the threads display a brilliant golden hue arising from structural coloration, ensuring exceptional lightfastness, retaining their color for millennia. This discovery elucidates the biomolecular foundations of sea silk's unique properties and establishes A. pectinata as a sustainable candidate for producing exquisite golden textiles and bioinspired pigments, thereby addressing the growing demand for eco&#8208;friendly and long&#8208;lasting colored materials in the textile and pigment industries.

         <title>Biomimetic Gradual Helical Structure for Enhancing the Strength and Toughness of Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving synergistic strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites remains a significant challenge. Drawing inspiration from multi&#8208;layer helical structures observed in natural organisms, a green, facile, and versatile transitional unit design strategy is designed to construct a gradual helical structure. This approach helps successfully achieve simultaneous strengthening and toughening of natural fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Multilayered helical arrangements are commonly observed in natural creatures to enhance their strength and toughness. A biomimicry of such an intricate structure has thus far been challenging. Herein, a green, facile, and versatile design strategy is proposed for transitional units. The proposed strategy is applied to develop a gradual helical (GH) structure that can reinforce thermoplastics using bamboo fibers (&#8776;20&#160;cm). A transitional unit is constructed through a combination of rolling and twisting. Following hot pressing, a biomimetic fiber&#8208;reinforced composite with a GH structure is fabricated. The GH structure is made up of 3D helical fibers with a gradual variation in the helical angle from the surface to the core, achieving minimal staggered angles and bridging of different fiber layers. Owing to stress decomposition and transfer as well as the coupling effect of the helical fibers, the GH structure exhibits outstanding tensile and bending strengths. Moreover, owing to the staggered arrangement, bridging, and deformation behavior of the fibers, the GH structure achieves remarkable impact toughness through crack deflection and fiber uncoiling. The GH structure and transitional unit assembly strategy can facilitate the development of advanced composites with superior mechanical properties through an environmentally friendly, simple, and versatile structural design approach.

         <title>Mechanical Homogenization Promoting Dual&#8208;Directional Upcycling of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an efficient dual&#8208;directional upcycling scheme enabled through a mechanical homogenization pretreatment. It enables various layered oxide cathodes to be reprocessed into fresh NCM cathodes with tailored Ni contents through boosted atomic diffusion in just 4&#160;h of solid&#8208;state sintering. Delivering upcycled cathodes with comparable electrochemical performances to their commercial counterparts, this approach excels itself from the cost&#8208;effectiveness over conventional acid&#8208;leaching resynthesis approaches.








Abstract
Upcycling is regarded as a sustainable and promising recycling solution for spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, current upcycling strategies such as converting Ni&#8208;lean to Ni&#8208;rich cathodes struggle to change the composition of the spent cathodes to meet the diverse market demands. In addition, the commonly employed molten&#8208;salts method requires tens of&#160;hours of high&#8208;temperature treatment, restricting its sustainability. Herein, this study reports an efficient, flexible dual&#8208;directional upcycling strategy to upcycle a broad family of layered oxide cathodes into fresh LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) cathodes with tailored Ni&#8208;contents&#8212;either increased or decreased&#8212;in just 4&#160;h via mechanical homogenization pretreatment. This study confirms that the bulk diffusion of transition metals (TMs) is the rate&#8208;determining step in the resynthesis process, and the mechanical homogenization can shorten the diffusion pathway of TMs, thus reducing the sintering duration effectively. The as&#8208;upcycled NCM cathodes can deliver electrochemical performance on par with commercial counterparts. Notably, a systematic technoeconomic analysis shows that upcycling spent LiCoO2 into NCM622 can yield a profit up to 35 US$/kg, 30% higher than the conventional acid&#8208;leaching resynthesis approach. This work provides an energy&#8208;saving, widely adaptable, flexible, and cost&#8208;efficient method for regenerating spent cathode materials, paving the way for the sustainable recycling of LIBs.

         <title>On&#8208;Chip Non&#8208;Volatile Reconfigurable Phase Change Topological Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 17, April 28, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an on&#8208;chip non&#8208;volatile reconfigurable THz topological silicon chip that integrates a waveguide&#8208;cavity coupled system with phase&#8208;change material, Ge2Sb2Te5, enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, phase shifters, and logic circuits.








Abstract
Programmable on&#8208;chip terahertz (THz) topological photonic devices are poised to address the rising need for high&#8208;capacity data systems, offering broad bandwidth, minimal loss, and reconfigurability. However, current THz topological chips rely on volatile tuning mechanisms that require continuous power to function. Here, a nonvolatile, programmable THz topological silicon chip is demonstrated that integrates a waveguide&#8208;cavity coupled system with phase&#8208;change material, Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), enabling persistent and efficient functionality without constant power input. Through precise tuning of the intermediate phase states of GST between amorphous and crystalline forms, a stable, non&#8208;volatile reconfiguration of the topological cavity is achieved, enabling transitions across over&#8208;coupling, critical coupling, and under&#8208;coupling states. Multi&#8208;level modulation of resonance transmission with a modulation depth of 70 dB is demonstrated, enabling precise control over the onset and disappearance of resonance modes and dynamic tuning of critical coupling states. The THz topological chip facilitates phototunable, volatile modulation across nonvolatile configurations, allowing controlled resetting of the coupling states of the cavity. Here, the first nonvolatile, programmable terahertz topological integrated chip is demonstrated, offering flexible control over resonance modes. This advancement significantly paves the way for integrating phase change materials into silicon topological chips for programmable photonic devices, including interconnects, modulators, and logic circuits.

         <title>A Multimodal Humidity Adaptive Optical Neuron Based on a MoWS2/VOx Heterojunction for Vision and Respiratory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional memristor is demonstrated for in&#8208;memory sensing and computing, leveraging a MoWS&#8322;/VOx heterojunction to enable high ON/OFF ratio up to 10&#8312; with ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2&#160;V. This bio&#8208;inspired multimodal design exhibits tunable synaptic behavior across electrical, optical, and humidity stimuli, enabling in situ modulation of conductance for low&#8208;power, real&#8208;time processing of multisensory signals. The reconfigurable humidity&#8208;adaptive neuron and humidity&#8208;mediated optical synaptic learning enable non&#8208;contact respiratory sensing and vision clarity control, paving the way for energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Advancements in computing have progressed from near&#8208;sensor to in&#8208;sensor computing, culminating in the development of multimodal in&#8208;memory computing, which enables faster, energy&#8208;efficient data processing by performing computations directly within the memory devices. A bio&#8208;inspired multimodal in&#8208;memory computing system capable of performing real&#8208;time low power processing of multisensory signals, lowering data conversion and transmission across several modules in conventional chips is introduced. A novel Cu/MoWS2/VOx/Pt based multimodal memristor is characterized by an ON/OFF ratio as high as 108 with consistent and ultralow operating voltages of &#177;0.2 surpassing conventional single&#8208;mode memory functions. Apart from observing electrical synaptic behavior, photonic depression and humidity mediated optical synaptic learning is also demonstrated. The heterojunction with MoWS2 also enables reconfigurable modulation in both memory and optical synaptic functionalities with changing humidity. This behavior provides tunable conductance modulation capabilities emulating synaptic transmission in biological neurons while showing potential in respiratory detection module for healthcare application. The humidity sensing capability is implemented to demonstrate vision clarity using a convolutional neural network (CNN), with different humidity levels applied as a data augmentation preprocessing method. This proposed multimodal functionality represents a novel platform for developing artificial sensory neurons, with significant implications for non&#8208;contact human&#8211;computer interaction in intelligent systems.

         <title>Hybrid Lipoplex Boosts Neuron&#8208;Microglia Crosstalk for Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease through A&#946;&#8208;Targeted&#8208;Autophagy and ApoE2 Gene Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid lipoplex (RMC/pApoE2) composed of guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS), oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2), and pApoE2 restores neuron&#8208;microglia crosstalk to eliminate A&#946; deposits from temporal and spatial multidimensions. It induces neuronal and microglial autophagy at the upstream and downstream of A&#946; metabolism, along with enhanced pApoE2 transfection for intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular elimination of A&#946; aggregates.








Abstract
Efficient clearance of amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) is vital but challenging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment due to its complicated regulation mechanisms during generation and metabolism. It necessitates a multidimensional synergistic strategy based on ingenious delivery system design. Herein, guanidine&#8208;rich lipids (metformin&#8208;inspired MLS and arginine&#8208;contained RLS) are devised to trigger selective chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy for amyloid precursor protein degradation in neurons. They are further co&#8208;assembled with oleic acid&#8208;modified cerium dioxide (OA@CeO2) to form RMC assembly for pApoE2 delivery (RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex). The OA@CeO2 boosts macro&#8208;autophagy, alleviates oxidative stress and inflammatory microenvironment, and promotes the neurons&#8208;microglia crosstalk for A&#946; elimination. Concurrently, both guanidine&#8208;rich lipids and OA@CeO2 benefit pApoE2 transfection in neurons, enabling the transport of A&#946; into microglia, and facilitating enzymatic hydrolysis and cellular digestion of extracellular A&#946;. The lipoplex&#8208;boosted neuron&#8211;microglia interactions ultimately eliminate both intra&#8208; and extra&#8208;cellular A&#946; aggregates. Consequently, the RMC/pApoE2 lipoplex eliminates &#8776;86.9% of A&#946; plaques in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and restored the synaptic function and neuronal connectivity. Moreover, it recovers the spatial memory of APP/PS1 mice to nearly the level of WT control. The presented hybrid lipoplex showcases an advanced gene delivery system, and offers a promising strategy for A&#946; clearance in AD treatment.

         <title>Structured Light Projection Using Image Guide Fibers for In Situ Photo&#8208;biofabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;based biofabrication is typically performed with single wavelength light sources and within benchtop devices. This work demonstrates FaSt&#8208;Light (Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light) as a new approach to achieve multiwavelength image projection using flexible image guide fibers, which enables a variety of applications for in situ biofabrication.








Abstract
Light&#8208;based biofabrication techniques have revolutionized the field of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Specifically, the projection of structured light, where the spatial distribution of light is controlled at both macro and microscale, has enabled precise fabrication of complex three dimensional&#160;structures with high resolution and speed. However, despite tremendous progress, biofabrication processes are mostly limited to benchtop devices which limit the flexibility in terms of where the fabrication can occur. Here, a Fiber&#8208;assisted Structured Light (FaSt&#8208;Light) projection apparatus for rapid in situ crosslinking of photoresins is demonstrated. This approach uses image&#8208;guide fiber bundles which can project bespoke images at multiple wavelengths, enabling flexibility and spatial control of different photoinitiation systems and crosslinking chemistries and also the location of fabrication. Coupling of different sizes of fibers and different lenses attached to the fibers to project small (several mm) or large (several cm) images for material crosslinking is demonstrated. FaSt&#8208;Light allows control over the cross&#8208;section of the crosslinked resins and enables the introduction of microfilaments which can further guide cellular infiltration, differentiation, and anisotropic matrix production. The proposed approach can lead to a new range of in situ biofabrication techniques which improve the translational potential of photofabricated tissues and grafts.

         <title>Supramolecular Conductive Hydrogels With Homogeneous Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) based conductive hydrogels have received great attention in bioelectronics on account of their tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of the conducting PEDOT phase limits their electrical and mechanical properties. Here, supramolecular hydrogels with self&#8208;doped PEDOT (S&#8208;PEDOT) homogeneously distributed are reported, which simultaneously exhibit high toughness (620 kJ m&#8722;3), softness (10.5 kPa) and conductivity (5.8 S cm&#8722;1).








Abstract
Mechanically resilient hydrogels with ion&#8208;electron mixed transport properties effectively bridge biology with electronics. An ideal bioelectronic interface can be realized through introducing electronically conductive polymers into supramolecular hydrogels. However, inhomogeneous morphologies of conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), have limited mechanical properties and ion&#8208;electron interactions. Here, supramolecular conductive hydrogels that possess homogeneous ionic and electronic transport are achieved. The materials demonstrate high toughness (620&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), stretchability (&gt;1000%), softness (10.5&#160;kPa), and conductivity (5.8&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which surpasses commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based hydrogels. The homogeneous network leads to higher charge injection capacitance and lower skin impedance compared to commercial electrodes or commonly used inhomogeneous PEDOT:PSS conducting networks. This significant advance arises from the homogeneous incorporation of the hydrophilic self&#8208;doped conducting polymer S&#8208;PEDOT, which has polymerized within a supramolecular polymer network template mediated by high&#8208;binding affinity host&#8208;guest crosslinks. Furthermore, the compatibility of S&#8208;PEDOT with hydrophilic secondary networks enables the realization of fully dryable and reswellable electronic devices, facilitating reusability and improving their ease of handling. It is anticipated that achieving such material architectures will offer a promising new direction in future synthesis and implementation of conductive hydrogels in the field of&#160;bioelectronics.

         <title>Rational Design of a Bilayer Interface for Long&#8208;Term Stability of Zn Anodes and MnO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bilayer electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface engineering strategy is presented to introduce sodium thioctate into bare ZnSO4 electrolytes. Benefiting from the bilayer electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, optimized solvation structure, and reconstructed inner Helmholtz plane, the resulting Zn&#8722;MnO2 batteries exhibit prominent cycling stability. This work provides effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Understanding the composition&#8211;characteristics&#8211;performance relationship of the electrolyte&#8211;electric double layer&#8211;electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface (EEI) is crucial to construct stable EEIs for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 batteries (AZMBs). However, the interaction mechanisms in AZMBs remain unclear. This work introduces sodium thioctate (ST) into ZnSO4 electrolyte to construct a stable bilayer EEI on both Zn and MnO2 electrodes. First, zincophilic ST regulates the solvation structure of hydrated Zn2+, suppressing corrosion and the hydrogen evolution reaction. Second, the specific adsorption of ST reconstructs the inner Helmholtz plane, facilitating the desolvation of hydrated Zn2+ and homogenizing charge distribution. Finally, ST molecules undergo reversible polymerization at the interface, forming a stable bilayer EEI with a poly(zinc thioctate) outer layer and a ZnS&#8211;organic amorphous inner layer, which ensures uniform zinc&#8208;ion flux and enhances mechanical stability. Additionally, the dynamic disulfide bonds in ST further enable self&#8208;regulation and self&#8208;healing of the interface, mitigating damage during cycling. As a result, the ST&#8208;enhanced Zn symmetric battery achieves 7800 cycles at 60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, while the AZMB exhibits only 0.0014% capacity decay over 10&#160;000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This bilayer EEI engineering strategy offers effective guidance for the rational design of safe and long&#8208;life aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Multiplexed Plasmonic Color Encryption of Microgel Architectures via Programmable Dithering&#8208;Mask Flow Microlithography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a scalable method for creating microgel structures with multiplexed hidden plasmonic colors via in situ grown AgNPs in porosity modulated hydrogel network. Utilizing advanced maskless flow microlithography and dithering&#8208;mask techniques, high&#8208;resolution and large&#8208;scale production of multiplexed plasmonic color encrypted microstructures are achieved and realized. A deep&#8208;learning analysis validates the fidelity between encrypted and decrypted colors, featuring significant potential for secure data storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are known for their unique plasmonic colors and interaction with light, making them ideal for color printing and data encoding. Traditional methods like electron beam lithography (EBL) and focused ion beam (FIB) milling, however, suffer from low throughput and high costs. In this paper, a scalable and cost&#8208;efficient method is introduced for producing multiplexed plasmonic colors by in situ photoreducing AgNPs within microgel architectures with controlled porosity. Utilizing a digital micro&#8208;mirror device (DMD)&#8208;based flow microlithography system combined with a programmable dithering&#8208;mask technique, the high&#8208;throughput synthesis of shape or barcoded microparticles is facilitated, along with large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;resolution images embedded with hidden multiplexed plasmonic colors. This approach allows for a hidden multiplexed plasmonic color code library, significant enhancing the encoding capacity of barcode microparticles from 33 to 303 (a 1000&#8208;fold increase). Additionally, quantitative agreement is achieved between chemically encrypted and optically decrypted plasmonic colors using a deep learning classifier. Moreover, the method also supports the production of large scale (&gt;5.6 &#215; 5.6&#160;cm2), high&#8208;resolution (&gt;300 dpi) microgel arrays encrypted with multiple plasmonic colors in under 30&#160;min. The multiplexed plasmonic coloration strategy in microgel architectures paves a new way for hidden data storage, secure optical labeling, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies.

Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots
In article number 2419668, Milad Abolhasani and co&#8208;workers present a photo&#8208;induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) approach for efficient bandgap tuning of lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals (NCs). Leveraging a photo&#8208;flow microreactor, the study elucidates the PIAER mechanism in LHP NCs. Furthermore, by introducing a thiol&#8208;based additive, the study demonstrates the first successful PIAER conversion of CsPbBr3 NCs into high&#8208;performing CsPbI3 NCs. The cover design was created in collaboration with SciFig Studio.

Nanostructured Transition Metal Oxides
In article number 2418407, Hyun Ho Kim and co&#8208;workers present a universal and ultrafast method for synthesizing nanostructured transition metal oxides (NTMOs) through the induced solidification of microdroplets, enabling rapid production within a minute. Since NTMOs can be directly grown on substrates in ambient air without requiring high&#8208;purity carrier gases, this approach facilitates industrial&#8208;friendly mass production.

         <title>Modulation of Near&#8208;Infrared Afterglow Luminescence in Inorganic Nanomaterials for Biological Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR&#8208;ALINs) are fascinating due to their optical property of continuing to emit near&#8208;infrared luminescence after excitation ceases. This review highlights recent progress in the rational design, modulation strategies and biological applications of NIR&#8208;ALINs. The challenges and opportunities in this field are discussed with the aim of stimulating further developments in biological applications using NIR&#8208;ALINs.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared afterglow luminescent inorganic nanomaterials (NIR&#8208;ALINs) possess the unique property of continuing to emit near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence after excitation ceases. They demonstrate excellent photostability, deep tissue penetration, and high imaging signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, NIR&#8208;ALINs can be re&#8208;excited in vivo using visible (Vis), NIR light or X&#8208;rays, which avoids the need for continuous in situ excitation, thus eliminating autofluorescence of biological tissues and reducing the tediousness of multiple injections. These features make NIR&#8208;ALINs particularly attractive for biological applications. In recent years, a series of NIR&#8208;ALINs with prolonged afterglow time and enhanced luminescence intensity have been discovered. However, the development of NIR&#8208;ALINs still faces significant challenges, as their NIR afterglow performance is usually insufficient to satisfy practical biological applications. There is still a lack of systematic analysis of the strategies for the regulation of NIR afterglow luminescence in inorganic nanomaterials. This review highlights the rational design and modulation strategies of NIR&#8208;ALINs, focusing on host substrate selection, trap engineering modulation and surface modification. Moreover, the biological applications of NIR&#8208;ALINs in bioimaging, bio&#8208;detection and disease therapy are summarized. Finally, the present challenges and perspectives in biological applications, such as insufficient afterglow properties and unclear biosafety, are also discussed.

         <title>Toward Practical All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Current Status of Functional Binders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As an effective strategy to address the key scientific issues and enhance the electrochemical performance of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, the summary of the latest research advances aims to stimulate the exploration of innovative binders in the future and to contribute to the realization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their high energy density and enhanced safety. Binder plays an irreplaceable role in stabilizing the electrode structure, enhancing carrier transport and modulating solid electrolyte interfaces by connecting each component of the electrode. The development of functional binders is seen as a key strategy to achieve higher energy densities of ASSBs. This review systematically examines recent progress in binder development, focusing on their roles, impacts, and failure mechanisms in ASSBs. It begins by outlining the specific functionalities required of binders in ASSBs and provides a comprehensive summary of their applications across different components, including the anode, cathode, and solid electrolyte. Furthermore, the review highlights innovative binder design principles while also summarizing key testing methods and advanced characterization techniques for evaluating binder performance. This review proposes future directions for binder design based on current developments and emerging technologies, with the aim of creating optimal binder systems for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density applications.

         <title>Coupling Strategies of Multi&#8208;Physical Fields in 2D Materials&#8208;Based Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling strategies between multi&#8208;physical fields and photoelectric effects in 2D material&#8208;based photodetectors are systematically&#160;summarized in this review. It highlights the effects of their synergistic mechanisms on energy band structures, carrier dynamics, and device performance. The article concludes with future research directions, providing a roadmap for developing high&#8208;performance intelligent optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
2D materials possess exceptional carrier transport properties and mechanical stability despite their ultrathin nature. In this context, the coupling between polarization fields and photoelectric fields has been proposed to modulate the physical properties of 2D materials, including energy band structure, carrier mobility, as well as the dynamic processes of photoinduced carriers. These strategies have led to significant improvements in the performance, functionality, and integration density of 2D materials &#8208;based photodetectors. The present review introduces the coupling of photoelectric field with four fundamental polarization fields, delivered from dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric, and ferroelectric effects, focusing on their synergistic coupling mechanisms, distinctive properties, and technological merits in advanced photodetection applications. More importantly, it sheds light on the new path of material synthesis and novel structure design to improve the efficiency of the coupling strategies in photodetectors. Then, research advances on the synergy of multi&#8208;polarization effects and photoelectric effect in the domain of bionic photodetectors are highlighted. Finally, the review outlines the future research perspectives of coupling strategies in 2D materials&#8208;based photodetectors and proposes potential solutions to address the challenges issues of this area. This comprehensive overview will guide futural fundamental and applied research that capitalizes on coupling strategies for sensitive and intelligent photodetection.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enhanced Trial&#8208;and&#8208;Error for Efficient Optimization of Rubber Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel workflow termed machine&#8208;learning (ML)&#8208;enhanced trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, for efficient optimization of rubber composites. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression to proficiently extract empirical principles. This integrated approach not only preserves the features of conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methodologies but also substantially enhances their efficiency and effectiveness.








Abstract
The traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach, although effective, is inefficient for optimizing rubber composites. The latest developments in machine learning (ML)&#8208;assisted methodologies are also not suitable for predicting and optimizing rubber composite properties. This is due to the dependency of the properties on processing conditions, which prevents the alignment of data collected from different sources. In this work, a novel workflow called the ML&#8208;enhanced trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach is proposed. This approach integrates orthogonal experimental design with symbolic regression (SR) to effectively extract empirical principles. This combination enables the optimization process to retain the characteristics of the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach while significantly improving efficiency and capability. Using rubber composites as the model system, the ML&#8208;enhanced trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach effectively extracts empirical principles encapsulated by high&#8208;frequency terms in the SR&#8208;derived mathematical formulas, offering clear guidance for material property optimization. An online platform has been developed that allows for no&#8208;code usage of the proposed methodology, designed to seamlessly integrate into the existing experimental optimization process.

         <title>Locally Resonant Metagrating by Elastic Impedance Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a breakthrough in wave manipulation physics and technology, enabling perfect absorption and precise wavefront control. The proposed concept of metagrating surpasses the size and efficiency limitations of conventional ones. Its compact, lightweight design tackles the key challenge inherent to all elastic wave&#8208;manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their implementation in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
Optical and acoustic metagratings have addressed the challenges of low&#8208;efficiency wave manipulation and high&#8208;complexity fabrication associated with metamaterials and metasurfaces. In this research, the concept of locally resonant elastic metagrating (LREM) is both theoretically and experimentally demonstrated, which is underpinned by the unique elastic impedance modulation and the hybridization of intrinsic evanescent waves. Remarkably, the LREM overcomes the size limitations of conventional metagratings and offers a distinctive design paradigm for highly efficient, compact, and lightweight structures for wave manipulation in elastic wave systems. Importantly, the LREM tackles a key challenge inherent to all elastic wave&#8208;manipulation metastructures, which consists in the unavoidable vibration modes in finite structures hindering their real&#8208;world&#160;applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Dynamic Strength of over 90&#160;GPa Enhanced by Intershell Friction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultraviolet laser irradiation is used to cut off the outer shell of double&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs). A velocity&#8208;dependent intershell friction occurs between the outer and inner shells. This friction results from dynamic localized commensurate contacts. The friction&#8208;induced intershell locking enhances the dynamic strength of DWCNTs to over 90&#160;GPa, indicating that DWCNTs possess exceptional resistance to high&#8208;velocity impacts.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional ultra&#8208;strong nanomaterials have attracted great anticipation for applications under extreme dynamic conditions. A photocatalytic method is developed to selectively cut off the outer shell of double&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), achieving non&#8208;contact measurement of intershell friction with both high temporal and spatial resolutions at high sliding velocities under optical microscope. The intershell friction linearly increases with the sliding velocity, with a slope related to intershell distance and chirality of DWCNTs. The maximum measured friction reaches 194.1 &#177; 7.3 nN at a sliding velocity of 977&#160;mm s&#8722;1, a value comparable to the tensile force (&#8776;450 nN) for breaking the outer shell. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the velocity&#8208;dependent intershell friction is related to dynamic localized commensurate contacts. The friction&#8208;induced &#8220;intershell locking&#8221; enhances the effective dynamic strength of DWCNTs from 64.8 &#177; 3.4&#160;GPa to 90.1 &#177; 4.0&#160;GPa at a tensile strain rate of 3300 s&#8722;1. This study reveals anomalous friction mechanisms at nanoscale and demonstrates promising application of DWCNTs as ultra&#8208;strong materials.

         <title>Achieving Zero Leakage, Ultralong Lifespan, and Intrinsic Opening Sensing in Microvalves Through Structural Superlubrication and Triboelectric Nanogenerator Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and intrinsic opening sensing are achieved in microvalves, making it feasible to develop high&#8208;performance fluid operation chips and integrated drive&#8208;control systems, which promote the miniaturization, integration, and flexibility of pneumatic flexible robots and human&#8208;machine interaction devices.








Abstract
Valves are critical components in advanced fluid control systems (AFCS) and play a vital role in applications such as soft robotics and medical devices. Traditional mechanical valves often suffer from issues such as leakage and wear, which compromise the efficiency and precision of air&#8208;driven systems. Here, a superlubricity microvalve (SLMV) is developed with characteristics of zero leakage, ultralong lifespan, and self&#8208;sensing capabilities. The SLMV demonstrates zero helium leakage at pressures exceeding 0.9&#160;MPa, and remains defect&#8208;free after one million collision tests and 5000 reciprocating sliding friction tests. Additionally, the valve features self&#8208;powered sensing that can detect its own open status, and thus enhances the self&#8208;feedback control. AFCS equipped with SLMVs may significantly improve the flexibility and functionality of pneumatic robots, facilitating the development of implantable drug delivery devices that are more durable, compact, safe, and reliable.

         <title>Superconductivity in PrNiO2 Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils a superconducting state in undoped parent compound PrNiO2 thin films, challenging previous views on nickelate superconductivity. Through scanning transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopic techniques, the research demonstrates the high structural quality and distinct electronic properties of the thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition. While requiring an independent verification, this result suggests that the self&#8208;doping mechanism is sufficient for superconductivity and the reported phase diagram of infinite&#8208;layer nickelates might need a revision.








Abstract
Several reports about infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films suggest that the superconducting critical temperature versus chemical doping phase diagram has a dome&#8208;like shape, similar to cuprates. Here, a highly reproducible superconducting state in undoped PrNiO2 thin films grown on SrTiO3 are demonstrated. Scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements show coherent infinite&#8208;layer phase with no visible stacking&#8208;fault defects, an overall high structural quality where possible unintentional chemical doping or interstitial oxygen, if present, sum well below the measurable threshold of the technique. X&#8208;ray absorption measurements show very sharp features at the Ni L3,2&#8208;edges with a large linear dichroism, indicating the preferential hole occupation of Ni1+&#8208;3dx2&#8722;y2${\rm d}_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in a square planar geometry. Resonant inelastic X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal sharp magnon excitations of 200&#160;meV energy at the magnetic Brillouin zone boundary, highly resonant at the Ni1 + absorption peak. The results indicate that, when properly stabilized, infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films are superconducting without chemical&#160;doping.

         <title>Flexible Patterned Fuel Cell Patches Stimulate Nerve and Myocardium Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The research develops an encapsulation&#8208;free, patterned flexible fuel cell patch (PFCP) with the capability to generate electrostimulation with precisely controlled pattern distributions by adjusting electrode configurations. The inherent adhesion and flexibility properties of the PFCP underpin its performance in vivo. The research introduces a novel and promising tool for accelerating tissue repair via the application of patterned electrostimulation.








Abstract
The distribution of electrical potentials and current in exogenous electrostimulation has significant impacts on its effectiveness in promoting tissue repair. However, there is still a lack of a flexible, implantable power source capable of generating customizable patterned electric fields for in situ electrostimulation(electrical stimulation). Herein, this study reports a fuel cell patch (FCP) that can provide in situ electrostimulation and a hypoxic microenvironment to promote tissue repair synergistically. Stable and highly efficient PtNi nanochains and PtNi nanocages electrocatalysts with anti&#8208;interference properties catalyze glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction respectively in an encapsulation&#8208;free fuel cell. The laser&#8208;induced graphene (LIG) electrode loaded with PtNi electrocatalysts is transferred to the surface of a flexible chitosan hydrogel. The resulting flexible FCP can adapt to tissues with different morphologies, firmly adhere to prevent suturing, and provide potent electrostimulation (0.403&#160;V, 51.55&#160;&#181;W cm&#8722;2). Additionally, it consumes oxygen in situ to create a hypoxic microenvironment, increasing the expression of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;). Based on the different pattern requirements of exogenous electrostimulation during the repair of various types of tissue, an axial FCP for peripheral nerves and a flower&#8208;patterned FCP for myocardial tissue are constructed and transplanted into animals, showing significant tissue repair in both models.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of electrical potentials and current in exogenous electrostimulation has significant impacts on its effectiveness in promoting tissue repair. However, there is still a lack of a flexible, implantable power source capable of generating customizable patterned electric fields for in situ electrostimulation(electrical stimulation). Herein, this study reports a fuel cell patch (FCP) that can provide in situ electrostimulation and a hypoxic microenvironment to promote tissue repair synergistically. Stable and highly efficient PtNi nanochains and PtNi nanocages electrocatalysts with anti-interference properties catalyze glucose oxidation and oxygen reduction respectively in an encapsulation-free fuel cell. The laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrode loaded with PtNi electrocatalysts is transferred to the surface of a flexible chitosan hydrogel. The resulting flexible FCP can adapt to tissues with different morphologies, firmly adhere to prevent suturing, and provide potent electrostimulation (0.403&#160;V, 51.55&#160;&#181;W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Additionally, it consumes oxygen in situ to create a hypoxic microenvironment, increasing the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;). Based on the different pattern requirements of exogenous electrostimulation during the repair of various types of tissue, an axial FCP for peripheral nerves and a flower-patterned FCP for myocardial tissue are constructed and transplanted into animals, showing significant tissue repair in both models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Long&#8208;Lasting Solid&#8208;State Aluminum Battery with High&#8208;Areal&#8208;Capacity Enabled by In Situ Polymerization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerization strategy is rationally proposed to synthesize cross&#8208;linked polymer solid&#8208;state electrolyte and polymer&#8208;encapsulated graphite cathode, which achieves intimate interface contact, dendrite free, flame retardancy, and confined volume expansion, enabling a solid&#8208;state aluminum&#8208;graphite battery with high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;safety, and long&#8208;lasting lifespan.








Abstract
Nonaqueous rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) attract intense interest due to their low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;capacity, and high&#8208;safety using nonflammable chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs). However, Al dendrite growth, interface degradation, and corrosiveness remain challenges in these ILEs. Herein, an ultrastable solid&#8208;state aluminum battery (SAB) based on a cross&#8208;linked polymer solid&#8208;state electrolyte (PSE) and a PSE&#8208;encapsulated graphite (PG) cathode is constructed via an in situ polymerization strategy, which maintains battery safety and realizes a synergy of interface compatibility between PSE/PG and PSE/Al interfaces. The PSE has a high room temperature ionic conductivity of 4.15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 and a low corrosiveness to Al anode, ensuring rapid and continuous transportation of chloroaluminate ions and homogeneous plating/stripping of metallic Al. In addition, the volume expansion of the PG cathode is almost negligible owing to the confinement effect of graphite within the cross&#8208;linked polymer skeleton. As a consequence, the assembled SAB demonstrates high areal capacity (0.67 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), good rate performance, and impressive cycling stability (no capacity attenuation after 10&#160;000 cycles). Such in situ polymerization strategy shows a broader promise for the development of safe and stable RABs in energy storage applications.

         <title>Broadband Chiroptics with Twist&#8208;stacked Hyperbolic Conducting Polymer Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic conducting polymer films can exhibit optical hyperbolic properties which here are found connected to large birefringence and linear dichroism. Off&#8208;axis twist&#8208;stacking of only two such subwavelength films can therefore enable large and broadband circular dichroism (CD), with CD bandwidth closely related to the hyperbolic bandwidth. The study demonstrates the general concept using twist&#8208;stacked stretched PEDOT films.








Abstract
Chiral&#8208;specific interaction of light with organic materials is important but typically arises from circular polarization&#8208;dependent absorption of specific optical transitions, resulting in narrow effective wavelength ranges. This study presents a scalable and universal concept for broadband circular dichroism (CD) enabled by strained conducting polymer thin films that possess in&#8208;plane hyperbolic optical behavior (i.e., optically metallic and dielectric properties along orthogonal directions). It is shown that off&#8208;axis stacking of two or more such thin films provides broadband CD that varies with the hyperbolic bandwidth and stacking geometry. By contrast to traditional chiroptical materials, the CD can also be modulated by redox&#8208;tuning of the hyperbolic polymer properties, opening for broadband dynamic chiroptical components.

         <title>Tuning Transition Metal 3d Spin state on Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Selective Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of P into a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst is shown to induce a shift in its electronic configuration toward a high spin state. This is proposed to enhance electron back donation via the dxz/dyz&#8208;&#960;* bond, which improves *COOH adsorption and facilitates the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO.








Abstract
Tuning transition metal spin states potentially offers a powerful means to control electrocatalyst activity. However, implementing such a strategy in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) is challenging since rational design rules have yet to be elucidated. Here we show how the addition of P dopants to a ferromagnetic element (Fe, Co, and Ni) single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) can shift its spin state. For instance, with Fe SAC, P dopants enable a switch from low spin state (dx2&#8208; y20, dz20, dxz2, dyz1, dxy2) in Fe&#8208;N4 to high spin state (dx2&#8208;y20, dxz1, dyz1, dz21, dxy2) in Fe&#8208;N3&#8208;P. This is studied using a suite of characterization efforts, including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) measurements. When used for CO2R, the SAC with Fe&#8208;N3&#8208;P active sites yields &gt;&#160;90% Faradaic efficiency to CO over a wide potential window of &#8776;530&#160;mV and a maximum CO partial current density of &#8776;600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory calculations reveal that high spin state Fe3+ exhibits enhanced electron back donation via the dxz/dyz&#8208;&#960;* bond, which enhances *COOH adsorption and promotes CO formation. Taken together, the results show how the SAC spin state can be intentionally tuned to boost CO2R performance.

         <title>Molecular Chain Interpenetration&#8211;Enabled High Interfacial Compatibility of Ionic and Electronic Conductors for Stretchable Ionic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high interfacial compatibility of ionic and electronic conductors is achieved via molecular chain interpenetration. With the benefit of the interface, the fabricated reversible adhesive electrode exhibits a high shear strength of 317&#160;kPa at a low voltage of 4&#160;V, and the ionic diode and transistor maintain stable semiconductor characteristics under arbitrary deformation.








Abstract
Ionic devices find applications such as flexible electronics and biomedicines and function by exploiting hybrid circuits of mobile ions and electrons. However, the poor interfacial compatibility of hard electronic conductors with soft ionic conductors in ionic devices leads to low deformability, sensitivity, electromechanical responses, and stability. Herein, an interpenetrating interface between silicone&#8208;modified polyurethane/carbon nanotube electronic conductors and ionoelastomers in an ionic device using in situ polymerization is fabricated. A robust interpenetrating electronic/ionic conductor interface is realized through molecular chain entanglement and molecular forces (such as ion&#8208;dipole interactions and H&#8208;bonds), effectively enhancing the bonding strength and contact area between the components and resulting in an excellent flexibility, stability, and device performance. The electroadhesive prepared based on this strategy exhibits a superrobust shear strength of 317&#160;kPa under a reduced voltage input of &#8722;4&#160;V, and the diode and the transistor can undergo arbitrary deformation while maintaining the semiconductor device characteristics, including rectification and switching. In addition, electromechanical transducers exhibit sensitive electrical responses to various deformation signals. This solution to the interfacial compatibility problems of electronic and ionic conductors holds promise for the development of multifunctional ionic devices.

The electroadhesive prepared based on this strategy exhibits a superrobust shear strength of 317&#160;kPa under a reduced voltage input of &#8722;4&#160;V, and the diode and the transistor can undergo arbitrary deformation while maintaining the semiconductor device characteristics, including rectification and switching. In addition, electromechanical transducers exhibit sensitive electrical responses to various deformation signals. This solution to the interfacial compatibility problems of electronic and ionic conductors holds promise for the development of multifunctional ionic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A star&#8208;shaped cross&#8208;linked polyglutamate (StCl) nanocarrier delivers melanoma&#8208;associated peptide antigens via redox&#8208;responsive linkers, inducing lymph node&#8208;targeted antigen presentation. The nanoconjugate activates dendritic cells, promotes effector T&#8208;cell responses, and enables tumor regression even in humanized patient&#8208;derived preclinical models. This scalable platform offers a promising approach to cancer immunotherapy and synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;associated antigen&#8208;based cancer vaccines suffer from limited clinical success compared to alternative immunotherapies in melanoma, an aggressive skin cancer with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The anti&#8208;tumor potential of a multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccine platform &#8211; a cross&#8208;linked star&#8208;shaped polyglutamate carrier (StCl) with marked lymphotropic character conjugated with melanoma&#8208;associated peptide antigens is evaluated through redox&#8208;responsive linkers. The co&#8208;delivery of melanoma&#8208;associated peptide antigens by the nanoconjugate platform induced significant effector immune responses in a mouse melanoma model. The nanoconjugate platform synergized with a PD&#8208;1 inhibitor to revert the immunosuppressive melanoma tumor microenvironment by improving cytotoxic T&#8208;cell infiltration, which prompted a superior anti&#8208;tumor effect with prolonged overall survival without acute organ toxicity. The antigen&#8208;specific anti&#8208;tumor immune response induced by the nanoconjugate platform is also validated in a melanoma patient&#8208;derived xenograft mouse model. A promising, versatile StCl&#8208;based platform is reported for generating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf multivalent nanoconjugate cancer vaccines for the safe and efficient immunotherapeutic treatment of melanoma.

         <title>A Novel Coating&#8208;Extrusion Method Enabled, High Energy, Power Density, and Scalable Production in Monolithically Integrated Energy Storage Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multifunctional fiber energy storage device consisting of LMO&#8208;LTP&#8208;AC is developed by the coating&#8208;extrusion method. Due to the continuous preparation process, devices exhibited an ultra&#8208;high production rate of 6000&#160;km&#160;year&#8722;1. This innovative approach significantly enhanced the device performance, achieving a specific capacity of 89.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 for fiber batteries and rate performance of 20 C for fiber hybrid supercapacitors.








Abstract
The rise of wearable electronics demands flexible energy storage solutions like flexible fiber energy storage devices (FESDs), known for their flexibility and portability. However, it remains difficult for existing fabrication methods (typically, finite&#8208;coating, thermal&#8208;drawing, and solution&#8208;extrusion) to simultaneously achieve desirable electrochemical performances and fast production of FESDs. Here, a new scalable coating&#8208;extrusion method is developed, utilizing a novel extruded spinneret with tapered apertures to create dual pressure zones. These attributes reduced porosity, enhanced electrode materials loading, and stabilized the interface between the fiber electrode and gel electrolyte of FESDs, enabling the integration of three functional electrodes for the fabrication of both fiber LMO&#8208;LTP batteries and fiber LMO/LTP&#8208;AC hybrid supercapacitor within a single energy storage device. The resultant multifunctional device achieved a high specific capacity of 89.4 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in battery mode and demonstrated excellent rate performance of 20 C with nearly 50% capacity retention in supercapacitor mode, with a production rate of 6000&#160;km&#160;year&#8722;1.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion in Strontium Iridate&#8208;Based Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel system for next&#8208;generation spintronic THz emitting sources based on 5d oxides that operate at room temperature. By interfacing a SrIrO3 epitaxial film with ultra&#8208;thin ferromagnetic materials and using femtosecond spin injection THz emission spectroscopy, this system confirms the generation of electromagnetic waves at the THz frequency.








Abstract
Oxide interfaces have enormous potential for future electronics with many applications, such as large spin Hall conductance, phase transitions, topological states, and superconductivity. However, previous investigations have predominantly focused on gigahertz frequencies; whilst the possibilities to fabricate devices operational at terahertz frequencies are demonstrated. A model solution is proposed employing 5d rare&#8208;earth, strontium iridate (SrIrO3) heterostructure with cobalt (Co) ultrathin layers. Femtosecond lasers are used to photoexcite the spins in Co, which super diffuse into the SrIrO3 layer to produce an ultrafast inverse spin Hall effect in sub&#8208;picosecond timescales. The devices exploit the external magnetic field and laser fluence to control the spin polarization from the Co layer and demonstrate a tailored spin Hall effect. These results thus pave paths for next&#8208;generation ultrafast oxide electronics offering possibilities for room temperature&#8208;based devices.

         <title>A General Strategy for Exceptionally Robust Conducting Polymer&#8208;Based Bioelectrodes with Multimodal Capabilities Through Decoupled Charge Transport Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents an effective strategy to address a longstanding challenge in the practical application of soft bioelectrodes: integrating excellent electrical performance, high compactness, and environmental durability. By leveraging the synergy between holey graphene and conductive polymer, this approach realizes reliable electron&#8208;ion transduction through the construction of robust ionic and electronic transfer pathways at the molecular level.








Abstract
Bioelectrodes function as a critical interface for signal transduction between living organisms and electronics. Conducting polymers (CPs), particularly poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), are among the most promising materials for bioelectrodes, due to their electrical performance, high compactness, and ease of processing, but often suffer from degradation or de&#8208;doping even in some common environments (e.g., electrical stimulation, chemicals, and high temperatures). This instability therefore severely undermines their reliability in practical application. To resolve this critical issue, a novel strategy of separating electron transfer from electron&#8208;ion transduction is proposed. Specifically, chemically derived holey graphene (HG), serving as an ultra&#8208;stable mixed ion&#8208;electron conductor, is introduced into the CP matrix. The HG can restore the CP's destructed conductive pathways, whilst its porosity and its intercalation by the CP synergically preserve fast ionic and molecular diffusion. The resulting bioelectrode therefore exhibits excellent low impedance, high charge injection capacity, electrochemical activity, and outstanding resilience to various harsh conditions, outperforming HG, reduced graphene oxide, CP, or graphene&#8208;coated CP electrodes. Furthermore, this strategy also exhibits broad compatibility with various processing techniques and proves adaptable to other electrode systems, such as stretchable electrodes, paving the way for practical applications in electrophysical capture, neuron modulation, and biochemical analysis.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Volumetric Methane Storage in Hyper&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linked Porous Polymers via Flexibility Engineering of Building Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unprecedented flexible porous polymer HCP&#8208;DPP, constructed by the flexible building unit with the rigid external crosslinker, achieves a desirable trade&#8208;off between porosity and density while displaying an unusual gate&#8208;opening effect; which set a record&#8208;high volumetric methane storage capacity among reported adsorbents, revealing a great promise for flexible hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers in methane storage applications.








Abstract
Adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional compressed and liquefied storage methods. However, its onboard application is restricted by low volumetric methane storage capacity. Flexible porous adsorbents offer a potential solution, as their dense structures and unique gate&#8208;opening effects are well&#8208;suited to enhance volumetric capacity under high pressures. This study developes a series of hyper&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymers (HCPs) with tunable flexibility by modifying the aliphatic chain length in double&#8208;benzene&#8208;ring building blocks, employing a cost&#8208;effective external crosslinking approach. The resulting flexible polymer, HCP&#8208;DPP, exhibits pore expansion under specific methane pressures, producing a high&#8208;pressure adsorption isotherm with gate&#8208;opening behavior. Combined with its intrinsic dense skeleton, this feature leads to superior volumetric methane storage performance over rigid counterparts. Notably, HCP&#8208;DPP achieves a record&#8208;high volumetric total uptake of 333&#160;cm3 STP cm&#8722;3 and a working capacity of 291&#160;cm3 STP cm&#8722;3 at 273 K and 100&#160;bar, exceeding the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) target of 263&#160;cm3 STP cm&#8722;3. These findings lay a foundation for developing advanced flexible porous adsorbents for practical ANG applications.

         <title>Mechanical and Light Activation of Materials for Chemical Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The actuation of stomata&#8212;referring to their opening and closing&#8212;is crucial for photosynthesis because it regulates gas exchange and water balance. Here, it is investigated if this life&#8208;like property could enhance the photocatalytic properties of soft materials. A hybrid supramolecular and covalent polymer hydrogel is developed to integrate photocatalytic chromophores and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties for controlling or improving light&#8208;driven superoxide or hydrogen peroxide generation.








Abstract
Mechanical expansion and contraction of pores within photosynthetic organisms regulate a series of processes that are necessary to manage light absorption, control gas exchange, and regulate water loss. These pores, known as stoma, allow the plant to maximize photosynthetic output depending on environmental conditions such as light intensity, humidity, and temperature by actively changing the size of the stomal opening. Despite advances in artificial photosynthetic systems, little is known about the effect of such mechanical actuation in synthetic materials where chemical reactions occur. It is reported here on a hybrid hydrogel that combines light&#8208;activated supramolecular polymers for superoxide production with thermal mechanical actuation of a covalent polymer. Superoxide production is important in organic synthesis and environmental remediation, and is a potential precursor to hydrogen peroxide liquid fuel. It is shown that the closing of pores in the hybrid hydrogel results in a substantial decrease in photocatalysis, but cycles of swollen and contracted states enhance photocatalysis. The observations motivate the development of biomimetic photosynthetic materials that integrate large scale motion and chemical reactions.

         <title>Multifunctional Terahertz Biodetection Enabled by Resonant Metasurfaces</title>

         <dc:description>
Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label&#8208;free manner is critically important for THz absorption spectroscopy. A compact and multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems is proposed.








Abstract
Testing diverse biomolecules and observing their dynamic interaction in complex biological systems in a label&#8208;free manner is critically important for terahertz (THz) absorption spectroscopy. However, traditionally employed micro/nanophotonic techniques suffer from a narrow operating resonance and strong absorption band interference from polar solutions preventing seriously reliable, on&#8208;demand biosensor integration. Here, a multifunctional THz plasmonic biosensing platform by leveraging multiple interfering resonances from quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum designed to noninvasively and in situ track the temporal evolution of molecules in multiple analyte systems, is proposed. In contrast to conventional microphotonic sensors, this platform demonstrates substantially broadband performance and reduced footprints, allowing for simultaneous detection of diverse molecular vibrant at multiple spectral points through robust near&#8208;field interactions. Furthermore, this sensor enables real&#8208;time analysis of amino acid absorption as water evaporates despite its strong overlapping absorption bands in the THz range. By utilizing the real&#8208;time format of the reflectance method to acquire a comprehensive spectro&#8208;temporal data collection, this approach supports developing a deep neural network to discriminate and predict the composition and proportion of multiple mixtures, obviating the need for frequency scanning or microfluidic devices. This approach offers innovative viewpoints for exploring biological processes and provides valuable tools for biological analysis.

         <title>Ultrafast and Universal Synthetic Route for Nanostructured Transition Metal Oxides Directly Grown on Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method for synthesizing nanostructured transition metal oxides (NTMOs) through induced solidification of microdroplets enables rapid production in air within a minute. This method allows precise control of alignment for various applications, including gas sensors and PUFs, and supports doping, reduction, and chalcogenization while preserving morphology.









Abstract
Nanostructured transition metal oxides (NTMOs) have consistently piqued scientific interest for several decades due to their remarkable versatility across various fields. More recently, they have gained significant attention as materials employed for energy storage/harvesting devices as well as electronic devices. However, mass production of high&#8208;quality NTMOs in a well&#8208;controlled manner still remains challenging. Here, a universal, ultrafast, and solvent&#8208;free method is presented for producing highly crystalline NTMOs directly onto target substrates. The findings reveal that the growth mechanism involves the solidification of condensed liquid&#8208;phase TMO microdroplets onto the substrate under an oxygen&#8208;rich ambient condition. This enables a continuous process under ambient air conditions, allowing for processing within just a few tens of seconds per sample. Finally, it is confirmed that the method can be extended to the synthesis of various NTMOs and their related compounds.

         <title>Sustainable 4D Printed Meta Biocomposite Materials for Programmable Structural Shape Changing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the architecture of a plant fiber cell wall is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture&#8208;driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials named meta biocomposites. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device.








Abstract
Biological structures provide inspiration for developing advanced materials from sustainable resources, enabling passive structural morphing. Despite an increasing interest for parsimony&#8208;oriented innovation, sustainable shape&#8208;changing materials based on renewable resources remain underexplored. In this work, the architecture of a single plant fiber cell wall (S2, for instance) is simplified to design novel concepts of 4D printed tubular moisture&#8208;driven structural actuators, using the hygromorphic properties of continuous flax fiber (cFF) reinforced materials. This new class of bioinspired active materials is referred to as metabiocomposites. Before bioinspired design, the materials are produced with a customized rotary 3D printer, qualified, and tested for sorption behavior. A parametric experimental, analytical, and FEA analysis highlights the programmability of the material through the effects of mesostructural parameters (printing inclination &#945;) and geometric factors (operational length L, inner diameter D, and thickness h) on the actuation authority. The overall performance is a trade&#8208;off between rotation and torque, with energy density comparable to that of the source of inspiration: natural fibers cell wall. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device, such as a solar tracker.

A parametric experimental, analytical, and FEA analysis highlights the programmability of the material through the effects of mesostructural parameters (printing inclination &#945;) and geometric factors (operational length L, inner diameter D, and thickness h) on the actuation authority. The overall performance is a trade-off between rotation and torque, with energy density comparable to that of the source of inspiration: natural fibers cell wall. The potential applications are illustrated through a proof of concept for a meteosensitive rotative structure that transmits motion to an external device, such as a solar tracker.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Modulated Perovskite Quantum Emitters via Surface&#8208;Enhanced Landau Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 570 meV emission shift is achieved through surface&#8208;enhanced Landau damping during phase transitions. In crystalline Sb&#8322;Te&#8323;, localized surface plasmons facilitate hot&#8208;electron injection, shifting the emission energy from 1.64 to 2.21 eV. This tunability is further enhanced by applying a DC voltage bias, making it suitable for integration with on&#8208;chip quantum photonic systems.








Abstract
Tuning quantum emission to a specific wavelength at room temperature holds significant promise for enhancing secure quantum communication, particularly by aligning with the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum. The integration of quantum emitters with phase&#8208;change materials enables emission wavelength modulation, especially when strong field enhancement is present. Antimony telluride (Sb2Te3) exhibits the potential to facilitate this functionality through its support of interband plasmonics and phase&#8208;change behavior. In this study, Sb&#8322;Te&#8323; antennae are designed and fabricated to tune the emission energy of adjacent perovskite quantum dots (QDs) by over 570 meV. The underlying mechanism involves the localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on Sb&#8322;Te&#8323; nanostructures, which exhibit a surface&#8208;enhanced Landau damping process that facilitates the decay of LSPs into electron&#8208;hole pairs. The generated hot electrons are then injected into perovskite QDs via the microscopic electron transport process, which can be triggered by the transition of Sb2Te3 from amorphous to a crystalline state, resulting in a significant emission energy shift from 1.64 to 2.21&#160;eV. Furthermore, the emission energy of perovskite QDs on crystalline Sb&#8322;Te&#8323; nanoantennae can be modulated through DC voltage bias, highlighting the potential for extensive wavelength tunability of quantum emitters integrated with electronic systems.

         <title>Mesoporous Nanogel Sprays as Universal Evaporation Interface Modifiers for Boosting Water&#8208;Cluster Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel surface spraying technique enhances evaporation materials, boosting solar&#8208;driven evaporation rates by 297% versus controls with broad substrate compatibility. Its nanogel spray featuring nanoconfined pores facilitates water&#8208;cluster formation and diffusion, reducing evaporation enthalpy to advance seawater desalination technologies. 








Abstract
Accelerating water evaporation is vital for processes like photosynthesis, dehydration, and desalination. Optimizing the pore structure and interfacial properties of evaporative materials can reduce evaporation enthalpy and increase efficiency. However, integrating the evaporation interface with water transport channels poses significant design challenges and complicates low&#8208;enthalpy evaporation analysis. To address these challenges, a hydrophilic nanovesicle gel is developed with a hydrophobic mesoporous structure as an ideal spray. This spray effectively upgrades their interface of universal substrates (including PVA hydrogels, balsa wood, nanofiltration membrane, cellulose paper, nylon fabrics, etc.), enabling the simple preparation of evaporation materials. The sprayed samples, at a low spraying dose of 40&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, achieved evaporation rates of 1.58 and 3.26&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 0.5 and 1 sun irradiance, which are 297% and 268% higher than their respective substrates. These nanogels offer benefits like edibility, low cost, ease of use, and compatibility with various substrates, showing great potential in seawater desalination, dehydration technology, crop yield enhancement, and coating/paint drying. More importantly, this work highlights the need for researchers to focus on the surface structure of materials, rather than merely using bulk gels, in the development of high&#8208;performance evaporative materials.

         <title>3D Soft Liquid Metal Electrodes for High&#8208;Resolution and Long&#8208;Term Electromyography in Muscle Trauma Assessment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the development of soft, biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) for high&#8208;resolution, long&#8208;term electromyography recording is done. In human and in vivo animal trials, LMe captures continuous neuromuscular signals of the muscle, evaluating the efficacy of rehabilitative drugs for muscle trauma. This work enables improved diagnostics and drug modeling for muscle disorders using a soft device interface.








Abstract
Electromyography (EMG) is a widely used diagnostic technique for evaluating the electrical activity of muscles and their controlling nerves. However, conventional surface electrodes with planar structures often suffer from low spatial resolution and suboptimal signal quality. Here, 3D&#8208;shaped, substrate&#8208;free, soft, and biocompatible liquid metal electrodes (LMe) are presented as a wearable interface for neuromuscular signal recording. These electrodes enable the acquisition of high&#8208;quality EMG signals while their intrinsic mechanical softness supports long&#8208;term use in clinical settings. In a human pilot study, continuous, high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution EMG monitoring of musculoskeletal activity over 25 days is achieved. Furthermore, in vivo EMG monitoring in mouse models of ischemia and volumetric muscle loss demonstrated the therapeutic effects of extracellular muscle&#8208;rehabilitative drugs. This work highlights the potential of LMe for advanced drug screening and long&#8208;term clinical diagnostics.

         <title>Anomalous Nonlinear Magnetoconductivity in van der Waals Magnet CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is demonstrated by manipulating internal magnetic orders in van der Waals magnet CrSBr interfaced by hBN layer. The anomalous NLMC presents multiple resistance states governed by both magnetization vector and N&#233;el vector utilizing the metamagnetic transition of CrSBr. This anomalous NLMC of the engineered CrSBr system promises efficient electrical readout of multiple magnetic information.








Abstract
Nonlinear magnetoconductivity (NLMC) is a nonreciprocal transport response arising in non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials. However, this ordinary NLMC signal vanishes at zero magnetic field, limiting its potential for applications. Here, the observation of an anomalous NLMC controlled by internal order parameters such as the magnetization or N&#233;el vectors is reported. This response is achieved by breaking both inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetry in artificial van der Waals heterostructures based on the magnetic CrSBr and insulating hBN. The nonreciprocal signal can be tuned between two different states in ferromagnetic monolayer CrSBr and among four different states in antiferromagnetic bilayer CrSBr, thanks to its metamagnetic transition. Remarkably, this output signal in the ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) state of CrSBr is three (one) orders of magnitude higher than those previously measured. A conductivity scaling analysis reveals the Berry connection polarizability as the origin of the anomalous NLMC. The results pave the way for high&#8208;frequency rectifiers with magnetically switchable output polarity as well as for an efficient electrical readout of the magnetic state of antiferromagnetic materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve synergistic therapy of diabetic wounds, morphologically switchable Au nanowires (ANW) and resveratrol&#8208;hemoglobin (HR) nanoparticles are co&#8208;loaded into the microneedles. The morphologically adaptable ANW continuously consumes glucose, while HR improves hypoxia, scavenges reactive oxygen species, and inhibits the differentiation of M1&#8208;type macrophages. This work thus realizes the long&#8208;term management of glucose during synergistic diabetic wound healing therapy.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are a common complication of diabetes and pose a significant threat to human health. High glucose concentration in the wound remains a major obstacle, necessitating effective strategies to achieve sustained glucose consumption for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In this study, an Au&#8208;based nanomaterial is developed that can adjust its morphology in different therapeutic processes. The prepared Au nanowire (ANW) can be converted into Au nanospheres (AS) under ultrasonic conditions by adjusting the amount of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on its surface for convenient delivery. Intriguingly, AS is depolymerized into ANW again in the wound area, prolonging the retention time, and ensuring continuous consumption of glucose. After constructing the morphologically switchable Au nanowire, a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) is applied it to microneedle and co&#8208;delivered it with hemoglobin (Hb)&#8208;resveratrol (RES) nanoparticles for synergistic diabetic wound therapy. In a streptozotocin (STZ)&#8208;induced diabetic mouse model, the microneedle degraded gradually, and the Hb&#8208;RES nanoparticles synergistically ameliorated hypoxia, scavenged ROS, and inhibited macrophage differentiation into pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 phenotypes. During this process, ANW continuously catalyzed glucose through its inherent glucose oxidase activity. Thus, this study provides novel insights into the long&#8208;term management of glucose concentration during synergistic diabetic wound healing.

This work introduces a programmable photonic analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital converter (ADC), leveraging phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) and foundry&#8208;based silicon photonics. 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;bit ADCs with zero quantization energy are achieved by the programmable and non&#8208;volatile nature of PCMs. The photonic ADC can reach a resolution of 8&#8208;bit with 65&#8208;state PCMs. An all&#8208;optical analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversion is successfully demonstrated, marking a significant advancement in efficient high&#8208;speed photonic processing.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance signal processing and telecommunication systems absolutely necessitate analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital converters (ADCs) that offer extensive bandwidth, exceptional precision, and minimal power consumption, in order to efficiently convert real&#8208;world analog signals into digital signals. While current electronic ADCs are constrained by limitations such as low bandwidth, high jitter noise, susceptibility to electromagnetic interference, and excessive energy consumption, photonic ADCs&#160;present&#160;promising solutions to overcome these challenges. Here, a programmable photonic ADC is developed by integrating phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) with silicon photonics fabricated using foundry processes. Thanks to the programmability and non&#8208;volatile nature of PCMs, 2&#8208; and 4&#8208;bit photonic ADCs are demonstrated on a single chip, achieving zero energy consumption during the quantization. Through the experimental demonstration of 65&#8208;state PCMs, photonic ADCs can attain a resolution of 8&#8208;bit, marking a significant milestone as the highest resolution reported to date for ADCs leveraging optical technologies. As a proof of concept, an all&#8208;optical analog&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversion system is demonstrated by integrating 2&#8208;bit photonic ADCs with optical sampling using a mode&#8208;locked laser (MLL). This system achieves&#160;the&#160;conversion of a 321&#160;MHz radio frequency (RF) signal at a sampling rate of 40 MS&#160;s&#8722;1. The programmable, energy&#8208;efficient, and high&#8208;speed photonic ADCs represent a significant advancement in the evolution of signal processing systems.

         <title>Remolding the Interface Stability for Practical Aqueous Zn/I2 Batteries via Sulfonic Acid&#8208;Rich Electrolyte and Separator Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of the electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 batteries and is largely determined by the properties of the electrolyte and separator.

Abstract
The electrolyte&#8208;electrode interface plays a crucial role in aqueous Zn/I2 battery and is largely determined by the properties of electrolyte and separator. Here, the synergistic effect of sulfonic acid&#8208;rich electrolyte additive and separator impacts the interface stability of Zn/I2 batteries is comprehensively investigated using operando synchrotron&#8208;based Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, and in situ spectroscopy. As a case study, a cost&#8208;effective additive known as lignosulfonic acid sodium (LAS) and a flexible sulfonated polyether sulfone membrane are employed to facilitate the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on the Zn anode and effectively suppress the shuttle effect. The chemisorption of LAS on Zn, its interaction with Zn2+, and the impact on the Zn desolvation process are systematically investigated through both theoretical simulations and operando measurements. Furthermore, the formation of an in situ SEI consisting of ZnS and ZnF2 is identified, which facilitates the uniform nucleation and planar plating of Zn(002), while effectively suppressing detrimental side reactions. Additionally, visualization experiments and in situ spectroscopy confirm that R&#8722;SO3&#8722; groups effectively impede the shuttle process of I3&#8722;/I5&#8722; anions through electrostatic repulsion. This work provides valuable insights for designing robust electrolyte interfaces for high&#8208;performance aqueous Zn/I2 batteries.

         <title>Scalable Van Der Waals Integration of III&#8208;N Devices Over 2D Materials for CMOS&#8208;Compatible Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an innovative technology is presented that will transform current monolithic and heterogeneous integration by using BEOL&#8208;compatible fluidic&#8208;assisted self&#8208;alignment transfer and integration process. Multi&#8208;dimensional integration of III&#8208;N optical and electronic devices over 2D materials on CMOS is demonstrated with no epitaxial constraints or different process thermal budgets.









Abstract
Advances in semiconductor technology have been primarily driven by exponentially reducing the size of silicon transistors and pushing the quantum limit. However, continued scaling becomes extremely difficult in accordance with Moore's law. Conversely, recent advances in monolithic and heterogeneous integration by exploring non&#8208;group IV materials envision beyond CMOS scaling. This study entails the development of scalable van der Waals (vdW) integration technology by using all CMOS back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible processes: vertical 3D and lateral 2D integration of III&#8208;N devices, 2D materials (graphene and molybdenum disulfide), and CMOS. Advanced fluidic&#8208;assisted self&#8208;alignment transfer (FAST) provides a process accuracy of &#8776; 32.6 nm as analyzed on a 200 mm wafer scale. The freestanding III&#8208;N chips are vdW integrated onto 2D materials, and the vdW interfaced multi&#8208;layer graphene successfully functioned as a back&#8208;gating interconnect line. Moreover, fidelity of the vdW interface is confirmed by conducting systematic yield, uniformity, and reliability analysis. The unique fourfold rotationally symmetric design of GaN transistors makes them compatible with massive and random FAST processing. GaN&#8208;based radio&#8208;frequency power and cascode GaN/Si transistors are integrated on silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator&#8208;CMOS. The proposed approach affords a remarkable advantage by surpassing the physical limits and facilitating functional diversification, thus advancing the concept of &#8220;More than Moore.&#8221;

         <title>Spontaneous Charging from Sliding Water Drops Determines the Interfacial Deposition of Charged Solutes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
When water drops slide on hydrophobic surfaces, they spontaneously leave behind negative charges along their path, resulting in the drops becoming positively charged. Here, it is shown that this phenomenon, known as slide electrification, influences the deposition of charged dissolved molecules. Using charged fluorophores and biomolecules, a preferential deposition of cations along the drop's trail is demonstrated, following the charge distribution pattern.








Abstract
It has been discovered during the last decade that when water drops slide on hydrophobic surfaces, they spontaneously leave negative charges along the drop path. The drops become positively charged with a potential of 1&#160;kV. This process, called slide electrification, influences drop motion and alters contact angles. Here, a third effect of slide electrification is demonstrated: the preferential deposition of dissolved solutes with positive charges. To illustrate this, water drops containing dissolved charged fluorophore ions are allowed to slide down a tilted hydrophobic surface, and their track is imaged. Two perylene derivatives are applied as fluorophores, one chromophore carrying positive charges, PDI+, and one carrying negative charges, PDI&#9472;. PDI+ is deposited at a concentration as low as 0.5&#160;&#181;m. In contrast, PDI&#9472; is only deposited above 5&#160;&#181;m. Experiments using grounded drops or a hydrophobic coating on a conducting substrate indicate that the electric field generated from the negative surface charges behind the drop causes a preferential deposition of the dissolved ions near the interface. This hypothesis also agrees with Kelvin probe measurements. Complex biomolecules deposition e.g. DNA can be also affected by this. These findings contribute to a better understanding of mass transfer processes at interfaces.

         <title>Monochromatic Responsive HOF Heterostructures via VIA&#8208;Group&#8208;Based Framework Hybridization for Fully&#8208;Covert Photonic Barcode</title>

         <dc:description>
The monochromatic responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructure is first achieved based on the VIA&#8208;group&#8208;based framework hybridization, which enables the concealment of intrinsic fingerprint character and the expression of multicolor responsive mode, further serving as fully&#8208;covert photonic barcodes. These findings offer novel insight on exploitating smart&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;HOFs for high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices.








Abstract
Luminescent responsive heterostructures with region&#8208;domained emission and integrated responsiveness exhibit great potential in information security, but always suffer from the direct exposure of fingerprint information at the initial state, making it easy to decode the hidden confidential information. Herein, the first monochromatic responsive hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) heterostructures are reported based on VIA&#8208;group&#8208;based framework hybridization toward fully&#8208;covert photonic barcodes. Designed HOF blocks with different VIA&#8208;group elements are integrated via a configuration&#8208;assimilation&#8208;based assembly method to generate the intrinsic monochromatic HOF heterostructures. Differentiated electronegativity of VIA&#8208;group elements endows each HOF block with distinct bonding stability, which triggers different responsive actions to the same stimuli, finally forming the multicolor emission mode at a responsive state. These monochromatic responsive HOF heterostructures can effectively hide the intrinsic fingerprint information, which further demonstrates the fully&#8208;covert photonic coding capability as high&#8208;security anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. These findings offer novel insight on the exploitation of smart&#8208;responsive hetero&#8208;HOF systems for advanced information encryption and anticounterfeiting applications.

         <title>Surface&#8208; and Spatial&#8208;Regulated Cd&#8208;Free Quantum Dots for Efficient, Mechanically Stable, and Full&#8208;Color Flexible Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a synergistic strategy that utilizes bidentate chelating diethyldithiocarbamate as surface ligands for cadmium&#8208;free quantum dots (QDs), which enhances the ligand binding on the QD surface and improves stress dissipation under bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices exhibit peak external quantum efficiencies above 15% and retain over 90% of their initial performance after 5000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible light&#8208;emitting diodes utilizing environmentally friendly cadmium (Cd)&#8208;free quantum dots (QDs) hold immense potential for next&#8208;generation wearable integrated displays. However, their overall performance lags behind Cd&#8208;based counterparts, and less research focuses on the suitability of QD layers in flexible devices. Herein, it is observed that the traditional surface oleate ligands on QDs readily detach under device operation after cycling bending, leading to increased surface defects and accumulated tensile stress in QDs layers, further diminishing their photoluminescence and electroluminescence performance. Based on these insights, a synergetic regulation strategy is developed employing a short&#8208;chain bidentate chelating ligand, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), to strengthen the binding of QDs with ligands, minimizing ligand detaching and consequently inhibiting the non&#8208;radiative recombination of QDs; Meanwhile, the short&#8208;chain DDTC also reduces the inter&#8208;dot spatial distance and decreases the Young's modulus in QDs films, effectively dissipating stress localization and retaining the film morphology upon bending. Consequently, the resulting flexible devices based on blue ZnSeTe/ZnSe/ZnS QDs and green/red InP/ZnSe/ZnS QDs demonstrate the peak external quantum efficiencies of above 15% and maintain over 90% after 5000 bending cycles, rivaling state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Cd&#8208;based flexible devices.

         <title>Mobile Oxygen Capture Enhances Photothermal Stability of Perovskite Solar Cells Under ISOS Protocols</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SnO2/ZnSb2O6&#8208;x double electron transport layer promotes a highly ordered arrangement of the perovskite lattice, improving film quality and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination, which in turn enhances carrier transport and overall device performance. Under photothermal conditions, ZnSb2O6&#8208;x effectively captures oxygen atoms at the SnO2 interface, preventing ion migration and thereby enhancing the photothermal operational stability of PSCs.








Abstract
Stability testing protocols from the International Summit on Organic and Hybrid Solar Cell Stability (ISOS) are essential for standardizing studies on the photothermally operational stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Under photothermal conditions, the migration of oxygen from SnO2 layer induces cationic dehydrogenation at the A&#8208;site of the perovskite, accelerating degradation to PbI2. This leads to the formation of photoinduced I2 and Pb0 defects, significantly compromising long&#8208;term stability. In this study, ordonezite (ZnSb2O6&#8208;x) as a multifunctional electron transport layer (ETL) that captures migrating oxygen atoms at the SnO2/perovskite interface is introduced, effectively preventing degradation of the buried interface. Additionally, the lattice match between ZnSb2O6&#8208;x and perovskite facilitates well&#8208;ordered perovskite film growth. As a result, PSCs featuring ZnSb2O6&#8208;x ETLs achieved a high power conversion efficiency of 25.02% and retained 90.62% of their initial performance after 1000&#160;h under the ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;2 protocol. Furthermore, devices demonstrated remarkable thermal stability, maintaining 83.69% of their original performance after 800&#160;h of maximum power point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C, meeting the stringent ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2 protocol requirements.

         <title>Precise Control Over Crystallization Kinetics by Combining Nucleating Agents and Plasticizers for 20.1% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A crystallization&#8208;kinetics modulation strategy has been developed to synergistically regulate the hierarchical morphology in a typical bulk heterojunction blend, via introducing a polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor as the nucleation agent and plasticizer, respectively. Consequently, a decent device efficiency of 20.1% is obtained.








Abstract
Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18&#8208;Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film&#8208;formation demonstrate that while D18&#8208;Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual&#8208;guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi&#8208;length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18&#8208;Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single&#8208;junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high&#8208;performance OSCs.

     alt="Precise Control Over Crystallization Kinetics by Combining Nucleating Agents and Plasticizers for 20.1% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crystallization-kinetics modulation strategy has been developed to synergistically regulate the hierarchical morphology in a typical bulk heterojunction blend, via introducing a polymer donor and a small molecule acceptor as the nucleation agent and plasticizer, respectively. Consequently, a decent device efficiency of 20.1% is obtained.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtaining controllable active layer morphology plays a significant role in boosting the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a quaternary strategy, which incorporates polymer donor D18-Cl and small molecule acceptor AITC into the host D18:N3, is employed to precisely modulate crystallization kinetics for favorable morphology evolution within the active layer. In situ spectroscopic measurements during film-formation demonstrate that while D18-Cl works as a nucleator to promote aggregation of D18 and foster donor/acceptor intermixing, AITC has exactly the opposite impact on aggregation of N3 and intermixing kinetics of donor and acceptor, working as a plasticizer. The mutually compensational effect of the dual-guests, as a result, enables synergistic control over fibrillar networks, multi-length scale morphology, and vertical phase distribution, leading to optimized 3D morphology for greatly enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer, suppressed charge recombination, and reduced energy loss. Consequently, the quaternary OSCs based on D18:D18-Cl:N3:AITC achieved an excellent power conversion efficiency of 20.1%, which represents one of the highest efficiencies for single-junction OSCs. This work presents an effective strategy to precisely regulate crystallization kinetics toward advanced morphology control for high-performance OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Galvanic Cell Bipolar Microneedle Patches for Reversing Photoaging Wrinkles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microneedles reverse photoaging wrinkles. In this study, a magnesium galvanic cell bipolar microneedle composed of redox reaction is introduced. Through playing the role of antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, cell migration, angiogenesis and so on, it can combine action of hydrogen, magnesium ion and micro&#8208;current to repair the damage caused by ultraviolet radiation and rejuvenate the skin.








Abstract
Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a major factor in the development of skin photoaging wrinkles. While current treatments can slow the progression of photoaging, it is very difficult to achieve complete reversal. This study introduces galvanic cell microneedle (GCMN) patches with magnesium&#8208;containing bipolar electrodes. These patches operate through a galvanic cell mechanism, generating microcurrents and releasing hydrogen gas and magnesium ions via a redox reaction. The combination of hydrogen's antioxidant and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties, microcurrent&#8208;induced stimulation of cell migration, and magnesium's promotion of angiogenesis and macrophage M2 anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization synergistically works to reverse photoaging wrinkles and rejuvenate the skin. Furthermore, this work examines how GCMNs may influence the transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;/Smad (TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad) pathway. This approach shows promise for advancing research and development in the field of medical cosmetology.

         <title>Synchronizing Multicolor Changes and Shape Deformation Into Structurally Homogeneous Hydrogels via a Single Photochromophore</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spiropyran&#8208;derived photochromphore that exhibits a concurrent molecular alteration in fluorescence and charge upon irradiation is reported, which simultaneously enables both photochromic and photodeformable capability upon covalent incorporation into a structurally homogenous hydrogel. The engineered hydrogel system demonstrates synchronized multicolor changes (from red to green) and shape deformation (from positive to negative phototropism) under a single stimulus of light illumination.








Abstract
The design of synthetic hydrogels that can mimic their biological counterparts in the simultaneous production of multicolor change and shape transformation in response to environmental stimuli is of great importance toward intelligent camouflage, encryption, and actuation. Previous efforts have focused primarily on developing heterogeneous hydrogels that highly rely on respective mechanisms to achieve color and shape changes separately, and synergistically synchronizing such two variations into structurally homogenous hydrogels via a single chromophore has been challenging. Here, the molecular design of a structurally homogenous hydrogel simultaneously exhibiting synchronized multicolor change and shape deformation triggered by a single stimulus of light is reported. The synchronization mechanism originates from a coupled alteration upon irradiation in the fluorescence emission and charge states of a spiropyran photochromophore covalently incorporated into the hydrogel network, thus leading to macroscale color change and shape variation in the hydrogel, respectively. Following this principle, both positive and negative phototropic deformation are obtained concomitantly with synchronized but flexibly tunable multicolor changes upon light illumination and demonstrated the ingenious application of biomimetic actuation, encryption, and camouflage by the rational combination of these two systems. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for developing bioinspired materials with synchronized functions via a single compound.

         <title>Unraveling Compressive Strain and Oxygen Vacancy Effect of Iridium Oxide for Proton&#8208;Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimized nickel&#8208;doped iridium (Ir) dioxide catalyst with optimized compressive strain and oxygen (O) vacancies, enhances Ir&#9472;O covalency, reduces the Ir&#9472;Ir distance, and accelerates water&#160;adsorption, breaking the linear scaling relationship of intermediates binding for efficient oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Iridium&#8208;based electrocatalysts are commonly regarded as the sole stable operating acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), but the linear scaling relationship (LSR) of multiple reaction intermediates binding inhibits the enhancement of its activity. Herein, the compressive strain and oxygen vacancy effect exists in iridium dioxide (IrO2)&#8208;based catalyst by a doping engineering strategy for efficient acidic OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations elucidate that compressive strain can enhance Ir&#9472;O covalency and reduce the Ir&#9472;Ir bond distance, and oxygen vacancy (Ov) as an electronic regulator causes rapid adsorption of water molecules on the Ir and adjacent Ov (Ir&#9472;Ov) pair site to be coupled directly into *O&#9472;O* intermediates. Importantly, hence, volcano&#8208;shape curves are established between the compressive strain/oxygen vacancy and OER current using OER as the probe reaction. Theoretical calculation reveals Ni dopant can modulate Ir 5d&#8208; and O 2p&#8208;band centers for increasing overlap of Ir 5d and O 2p orbits to trigger a continuous metal site&#8208;oxygen vacancy synergistic mechanism (MS&#8208;OVSM) pathway, successfully breaking the LSR of intermediates binding during OER. Therefore, the resultant proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) device fabricated using T&#8208;0.24Ni/IrO2 delivers a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and operates stably for 500&#160;h.

         <title>MAPbBr3 Quantum Dots Encapsulated Within Lanthanide&#8208;MOFs for Time&#8208;Resolved Multicolor Dynamic Anticounterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting are achieved by utilizing the quantum&#8208;confinement effect of MAPbBr3 QDs within the MOFs. This unique anticounterfeiting tag enables high PL intensity and visible recognition to the naked eye and allows for multiple authentications in both time and space dimensions. These results provide valuable insights for designing high&#8208;security, high&#8208;intensity multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting tags.








Abstract
Multicolor dynamic optical materials exhibit significant potential in the realms of anticounterfeiting and information encryption, benefitting from their capacity for generating unpredictable optical information that changes over time. Herein, a novel approach is presented utilizing quantum&#8208;confinement effect of MAPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) embedded within lanthanide&#8208;metal organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) for time&#8208;resolved multicolor dynamic anticounterfeiting applications. The dimensions of MAPbBr3 QDs undergo temporal variations during in situ growth, resulting in dynamic alterations in luminescent color due to the quantum&#8208;confinement effect. Furthermore, the emission colors of MAPbBr3@Eu&#8208;MOFs can be modulated by varying UV excitation wavelengths, thereby conferring a spatially distinguishable anticounterfeiting dimension. The time&#8208;resolved unpredictability of these dynamic color changes coupled with sustained luminescent intensity and multi&#8208;dimensional anticounterfeiting, render them suitable system for advanced graphical coding. These findings pave the way for the advancement of intelligent multicolor dynamic optical anticounterfeiting.

         <title>In Situ Grown RuNi Alloy on ZrNiNx as a Bifunctional Electrocatalyst Boosts Industrial Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic nitrides supported RuNi alloy (RuNi/ZrNiNx) epitaxial heterostructure as a bifunctional catalyst achieves highly stable and active hydrogen and oxygen evolution at ampere&#8208;scale current densities. Charge redistribution induced high&#8208;valence Zr promotes the water dissociation, electron&#8208;deficient Ru facilitates H desorption, and the hollow site of tri&#8208;coordinated Ni in NiNx that is adjacent to Zr atom favors the energetically favorable O2 production.








Abstract
Alkaline water electrolysis represents a pivotal technology for green hydrogen production yet faces critical challenges including limited current density and high energy input. Herein, a heterostructured bimetallic nitrides supported RuNi alloy (RuNi/ZrNiNx) is developed through in situ epitaxial growth under ammonolysis, achieving exceptional bifunctional activity and durability for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1&#160;m KOH electrolyte. The RuNi/ZrNiNx exhibits a HER current density of &#8722;2 A cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential of 392.8&#160;mV, maintaining initial overpotential after 1000&#160;h continuous electrolysis at &#8722;500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. For OER, it delivers a current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.822&#160;V versus RHE, and sustains stable operation for 705&#160;h at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental and theoretical studies unveil that the charge redistribution&#8208;induced high&#8208;valence Zr centers effectively polarize H&#9472;O bonds and promote water dissociation, and the electron&#8208;deficient interface Ru sites optimize hydrogen desorption kinetics. Dynamic OH spillovers from Zr sites to the adjacent tri&#8208;coordinated Ni hollow sites in NiNx promote rapid *OH intermediate desorption and active site regeneration. Notably, the tri&#8208;coordinated Ni hollow sites in NiNx proximal to Zr atoms exhibit tailored adsorption strength for oxo&#8208;intermediates, enabling a more energetically favorable pathway for O2 production.

         <title>Skin&#8208;Inspired and Self&#8208;Regulated Hydrophobic Hydrogel for Diabetic Wound Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;mimetic smart hydrophobic hydrogel is developed for efficient diabetic wound therapy. Thehydrophobic segments form dense &#8220;epidermis&#8221;, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long&#8208;term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the responsive segments generate glucose&#8208;labile &#8220;sweat pores&#8221;, facilitating on&#8208;demand drug release to remodel the hostile wound microenvironment.








Abstract
Diabetic wounds are refractory and recurrent diseases that necessitate the development of multifunctional dressings. Inspired by the structure and function of the skin, we herein delicately design a novel swollen hydrophobic hydrogel (QL@MAB) composed of hydrophobic methyl acrylate (MA) and (3&#8208;acrylamidophenyl)boronic acid (AAPBA) network and co&#8208;loaded with antioxidant quercetin (Q) and antibiotic levofloxacin (L) for efficient diabetic wound therapy. The hydrophobic MA segments undergo phase separation to form a dense &#8220;epidermis&#8221;, ensuring prolonged drug diffusion, long&#8208;term water retention, and high water content. Meanwhile, the AAPBA segments generate glucose&#8208;labile &#8220;sweat pores&#8221; via borate ester bonds with the polyphenol drug Q. Upon encountering the hyperglycemic wound microenvironment, the &#8220;sweat pores&#8221; are dilated due to the cleavage of the borate ester bonds and exposure of the diffusion channel, facilitating drug release for accelerated wound healing. In the infected diabetic rats, QL@MAB achieves rapid wound debridement and re&#8208;epithelization while promoting angiogenesis, hair follicle regeneration, and extracellular matrix remodeling. Taken together, this study not only represents a multipronged dressing for effective interventions of diabetic wounds but also contributes to the rational design of smart hydrogels tailored for biomedical applications.

         <title>Co&#8208;Enriched High Entropy Oxides for Efficient Continuous Electrochemical Methane Conversion: Catalytic Performance and Sustainability Insights</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Co&#8208;rich high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst enables efficient electrochemical methane&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion at room temperature. By leveraging elemental enrichment, the catalyst achieves high selectivity and stability, outperforming conventional systems. Process modeling further highlights its economic viability and significant potential for reducing carbon emissions.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of methane offers a sustainable alternative to traditional thermochemical syngas pathways; however, the rational design of catalysts that ensure high productivity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) catalyst composed of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni is explored, with a targeted element enriched, and identify that a Co&#8208;rich HEO demonstrates high efficiency in room&#8208;temperature electrochemical methane conversion. This analysis of the projected density of states (PDOS) reveals that Co sites in the HEO catalyst possess an optimally positioned p&#8208;band center for methane activation. The Co&#8208;rich HEO catalyst achieves an ethanol production rate of 12315&#160;&#181;mol/gcat/hr at 1.6 VRHE, with a Faradaic efficiency of 63.5%; a flow cell electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst achieves continuous methane&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion at a rate of 26533&#160;&#181;mol/gcat/hr over 100 h. Process modeling evaluates the economic and environmental implications, demonstrating that a commercially viable process can be realized through economies of scale while significantly reducing CO&#8322; emissions.

         <title>Ephaptic Coupling in Ultralow&#8208;Power Ion&#8208;Gel Nanofiber Artificial Synapses for Enhanced Working Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible ionic synaptic device is developed to replicate the brain's ion transport and ephaptic coupling mechanisms, enabling efficient energy consumption and complex connectivity. By using ions for signal transmission, the device achieves spatiotemporal signal integration, mimicking the computational capabilities of biological neural networks. This work advances the development of brain&#8208;like AI systems with enhanced connectivity and processing efficiency.








Abstract
Neuromorphic devices are designed to&#160;replicate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing advantages found in biological neural networks by emulating the working mechanisms of neurons and synapses. However, most existing neuromorphic devices focus primarily on functionally mimicking biological synapses, with insufficient emphasis on ion transport mechanisms. This limitation makes it challenging to achieve the complexity and connectivity inherent in biological systems, such as ephaptic coupling. Here, an ionic biomimetic synaptic device based on a flexible ion&#8208;gel nanofiber network is proposed, which transmits information and enables ephaptic coupling through capacitance formation by ion transport with an extremely low energy consumption of just 6 femtojoules. The hysteretic ion transport behavior endows the device with synaptic&#8208;like memory effects, significantly enhancing the performance of the reservoir computing system for classifying the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and demonstrating high efficiency in edge learning. More importantly, the devices in an array establish communication connections, exhibiting global oscillatory behaviors similar to ephaptic coupling in biological neural networks. This connectivity enables the array to perform working memory tasks, paving the way for developing brain&#8208;like systems characterized by high complexity and vast connectivity.

Abstract
The demand for accurate vascular simulators is increasing to facilitate effective clinical studies on cardiovascular diseases. The research presents the miniaturized design and precise programable regulation of an artificial magnetic heart valve inspired by the human aortic valve, demonstrating the diverse types of pulsating waves.

This valve system responds rapidly to changes in magnetic fields controlled by miniaturized electromagnets, enabling precise regulation of fluid pressure and flow rate. This allows for the generation of various pressure waveforms and accurately replicates diverse blood pressure changes with a compact design. The design, working mechanism, fabrication process, and optimization of the magnetically controlled biomimetic heart valve are discussed and&#160;its performance as a cardiovascular simulator for human and animal models is evaluated. This artificial valve system has the potential to be utilized in humanoid robots to generate heart&#8208;like pressure, thereby paving the way for replicating human physiological characteristics. This research promises significant advancements in cardiovascular clinical trials and biomedical research along with the development of humanoid robots and biomimetic mechanical systems.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering of Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots In Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a photochemical synthetic route for bandgap engineering of metal halide perovskite quantum dots. Utilizing a material&#8208;efficient microfluidic platform, the underlying mechanism of the photo&#8208;induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER)&#160;of metal halide perovskite quantum dots is unveiled and first instance of the PIAER&#8208;enabled synthesis of high&#8208;performing CsPbI3 NCs is reported.








Abstract
Over the past decade, lead halide perovskite (LHP) nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted significant attention due to their tunable optoelectronic properties for next&#8208;generation printed photonic and electronic devices. High&#8208;energy photons in the presence of haloalkanes provide a scalable and sustainable pathway for precise bandgap engineering of LHP NCs via photo&#8208;induced anion exchange reaction (PIAER) facilitated by in situ generated halide anions. However, the mechanisms driving photo&#8208;induced bandgap engineering in LHP NCs remain not fully understood. This study elucidates the underlying PIAER mechanisms of LHP NCs through an advanced microfluidic platform. Additionally, the first instance of a PIAER, transforming CsPbBr3 NCs into high&#8208;performing CsPbI3 NCs, with the assistance of a thiol&#8208;based additive is reported. Utilizing an intensified photo&#8208;flow microreactor accelerates the anion exchange rate 3.5&#8208;fold, reducing material consumption 100&#8208;fold compared to conventional batch processes. It is demonstrated that CsPbBr3 NCs act as photocatalysts, driving oxidative bond cleavage in dichloromethane and promoting the photodissociation of 1&#8208;iodopropane using high&#8208;energy photons. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that a thiol&#8208;based additive plays a dual role: surface passivation, which enhances the photoluminescence quantum yield, and facilitates the PIAER. These findings pave the way for the tailored design of perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Morphology Optimization of Spinel Catalysts for High&#8208;Efficiency Photothermal Catalytic Upcycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three morphologies of spinel catalysts for the decomposition of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are prepared by hydrothermal method. The optimization of morphology made a positive impact on PET conversion, yield of bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and photocatalytic performance. Catalyst with octahedral morphology has an optimum content of oxygen vacancies, which can work as active sites to promote PET degradation.








Abstract
Thermocatalytic recycling of plastics is typically constrained by high energy input requirements, resulting in poor economic efficiency and necessitating the utilization of light power. Indeed, photothermal catalysis offers several advantages over traditional photocatalysis and enables more efficient use of light energy. In this study, unique octahedral spinel&#8208;structured cobalt manganese oxide (CoMn2O4) catalysts are prepared. CoMn2O4 acts as both a photothermal reagent and catalyst, demonstrating low light intensity requirements, high conversion rates, enhanced reactivity, and superior stability during polyethylene terephthalate (PET) glycolysis via photothermocatalysis. Oxygen vacancies created on CoMn2O4 facilitate PET glycolysis by providing reactive sites that promote nucleophilic addition and subsequent elimination reactions. The spinel structure of CoMn2O4 ensures high thermal stability, while the octahedral configuration enhances the optical absorption coefficient and photothermal conversion efficiency. Under identical conditions, the PET conversion efficiency of CoMn2O4 in photothermal catalysis is 3.1 times higher than under purely thermal conditions, while maintaining high selectivity for high&#8208;value monomers. This study presents a new catalyst design approach for highly efficient upcycling of plastics, highlighting its substantial potential in this field.

         <title>Simultaneous AoLP and DoLP Detection in a Bias&#8208;Switchable PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 Heterojunction for Polarization Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 16, April 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 vdWH heterostructure polarized photodetector is introduced, which possesses the capability to simultaneously measure both the linear polarization angle and the degree of polarization. This device demonstrates bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection over a wide spectral range, and exhibits a bipolar photoresponse even at zero bias. Taking advantage of these unique properties, the photodetector has been successfully applied in imaging scenarios and has also been simulated for use in dual coding communication.








Abstract
On&#8208;chip polarized photodetectors play a crucial role in advancing ultra&#8208;compact optoelectronic devices for next&#8208;generation technologies. However, simultaneously detecting the angle of linear polarization (AoLP) and the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) within a single device remains a challenging task, particularly due to the inherently weak polarization states found in naturally anisotropic materials. In this paper, it is reported on the development of a twisted monopole barrier photodetector based on a PdSe2/MoS2/PdSe2 configuration. This photodetector features a rapid response time of 7&#8211;12&#160;&#181;s. In an imaging demonstration, it operates as a single&#8208;polarization photodetector, reconstructing AoLP and DoLP distributions of target objects through bias&#8208;switchable polarization detection across a wide spectral range, all without the plasmonic/metasurface nanostructures or polarization filters. Additionally, it demonstrates bipolar characteristics under zero&#8208;bias conditions at room temperature, enabling dual&#8208;binary coding for polarimetric&#8208;encoded communication. These combination of features positions the photodetector as a highly promising candidate for on&#8208;chip applications.

Recreating Silk's Fibrillar Nanostructure
In article number 2413786, Martin Zaki, Benjamin James Allardyce, and co&#8208;workers present a new method to solubilise silk without degumming and use it to successfully wet spin fibres with a nanofibrillar structure akin to natural silk, but twice as tough. This new spinning dope, which contains both undegraded fibroin and sericin, spontaneously exhibited naturally&#8208;occurring liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation behaviour, which is likely to be a crucial step in replicating native silk spinning. Cover art by Ella Maru Studios.

Directly Printed Soft 3D Plasmonic Resonators
Conventional 2D plasmonic resonators face limitations in their application to soft electronic platforms due to signal attenuation induced by lossy media. In article number 2418182, Seungjun Chung and co&#8208;workers developed directly printed 3D plasmonic resonators with highly conductive elastomeric composites. Diverse soft 3D resonators demonstrated structural and signal integrities under repetitive strain cycles, highlighting higher Q&#8208;factor resonances even on lossy media.

Rapid Drying
Rapid drying is a key principle for scalable, high&#8208;speed, uniform, and pinhole&#8208;less deposition of 2D materials. Using hot dipping and air knife sweeping (AKS), deposition speeds up to 0.21 m2 min&#8722;1 are achieved, surpassing conventional protocols by 2&#8211;4 orders of magnitude. This approach can extend to 1D and 3D materials if they are uniformly dispersible in rapidly evaporable liquids. More details can be found in article number 2411447 by, Chuan Wang, Dongwook Lee, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Colored Radiative Cooling: from Photonic Approaches to Fluorescent Colors and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has become a prevailing technology for achieving colorful appearance and simultaneously enhancing the effective solar reflectance of cooling coatings. This review presents recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings in real&#8208;world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization methods, it reviews CRC coloration approaches, including photonic structural colors, complementary color absorption and Purcell&#8208;enhanced fluorescent colors. The review concludes with self&#8208;adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation and their potentially practical applications as well as critical challenges.









Abstract
Radiative cooling technology is gaining prominence as a sustainable solution for improving thermal comfort and reducing energy consumption associated with cooling demands. To meet diverse functional requirements such as aesthetics, switchable cooling, camouflage, and colored smart windows, color is often preferred over a white opaque appearance in the design of radiative cooling materials. Colored radiative cooling (CRC) has emerged as a prevailing technology not only for achieving a colorful appearance but also for increasing the effective solar reflectance to enhance cooling performance (through the incorporation of fluorescent materials). This paper reviews recent advancements in CRC and its profound impact on energy savings and real&#8208;world applications. After introducing the fundamentals of CRC and color characterization, various photonic approaches are explored that leverage resonant structures to achieve coloration in radiative cooling, comparing them with conventional coloration methods based on optical materials like fluorescent pigments that can convert absorbed ultraviolet light into visible&#8208;light emission. Furthermore, the review delves into self&#8208;adaptive CRC materials featuring dynamic optical modulation that responds to temperature fluctuations. Lastly, the potential application of CRC materials is assessed, a comprehensive outlook on their future development is offered, and the critical challenges in practical applications are discussed.

         <title>Isolated Metal Centers Activate Small Molecule Electrooxidation: Mechanisms and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive summary of recent progress in the design, synthesis, and characterization of isolated atom site catalysts for the electro&#8208;oxidation of small molecules such as hydrogen, water, alcohols, formic acid, HMF, urea, ethylene, glycerol, and more. It highlights precise modulation strategies and delves into the detailed exploration of structure&#8208;activity relationships.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxidation of small molecules shows great promise to substitute oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) to enhance reaction kinetics and reduce energy consumption, as well as produce high&#8208;valued chemicals or serve as fuels. For these oxidation reactions, high&#8208;valence metal sites generated at oxidative potentials are typically considered as active sites to trigger the oxidation process of small molecules. Isolated atom site catalysts (IASCs) have been developed as an ideal system to precisely regulate the oxidation state and coordination environment of single&#8208;metal centers, and thus optimize their catalytic property. The isolated metal sites in IASCs inherently possess a positive oxidation state, and can be more readily produce homogeneous high&#8208;valence active sites under oxidative potentials than their nanoparticle counterparts. Meanwhile, IASCs merely possess the isolated metal centers but lack ensemble metal sites, which can alter the adsorption configurations of small molecules as compared with nanoparticle counterparts, and thus induce various reaction pathways and mechanisms to change product selectivity. More importantly, the construction of isolated metal centers is discovered to limit metal d&#8208;electron back donation to CO 2p* orbital and reduce the overly strong adsorption of CO on ensemble metal sites, which resolve the CO poisoning problems in most small molecules electro&#8208;oxidation reactions and thus improve catalytic stability. Based on these advantages of IASCs in the fields of electrochemical oxidation of small molecules, this review summarizes recent developments and advancements in IASCs in small molecules electro&#8208;oxidation reactions, focusing on anodic HOR in fuel cells and OER in electrolytic cells as well as their alternative reactions, such as formic acid/methanol/ethanol/glycerol/urea/5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation reactions as key reactions. The catalytic merits of different oxidation reactions and the decoding of structure&#8211;activity relationships are specifically discussed to guide the precise design and structural regulation of IASCs from the perspective of a comprehensive reaction mechanism. Finally, future prospects and challenges are put forward, aiming to motivate more application possibilities for diverse functional IASCs.

         <title>Electrolyte Regulation toward Cathodes with Enhanced&#8208;Performance in Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to highlight the effect of electrolyte regulation on alleviating issues on the cathode side in aqueous ZIBs. The recent advances of electrolyte regulation strategies are present, with a comprehensive discussion and summary of regulation mechanisms, which can provide guidance to develop novel and multifunctional electrolytes for next&#8208;generation aqueous ZIBs.








Abstract
Enhancing cathodic performance is crucial for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, with the primary focus of research efforts being the regulation of the intrinsic material structure. Electrolyte regulation is also widely used to improve full&#8208;cell performance, whose main optimization mechanisms have been extensively discussed only in regard to the metallic anode. Considering that ionic transport begins in the electrolyte, the modulation of the electrolyte must influence the cathodic performance or even the reaction mechanism. Despite its importance, the discussion of the optimization effects of electrolyte regulation on the cathode has not garnered the attention it deserves. To fill this gap and raise awareness of the importance of electrolyte regulation on cathodic reaction mechanisms, this review comprehensively combs the underlying mechanisms of the electrolyte regulation strategies and classifies the regulation mechanisms into three main categories according to their commonalities for the first time, which are ion effect, solvating effect, and interfacial modulation effect, revealing the missing puzzle piece of the mechanisms of electrolyte regulation in optimizing the cathode.

This review probes recent advancements in PEMWEs for green hydrogen production from the perspective of acidic OER, identifies challenges related to corrosive environments and oxidative conditions, and proposes strategies to enhance the long&#8208;term stability of PEMWEs by addressing both catalyst and membrane electrode assembly deactivation.








Abstract
Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) represents a promising technology for renewable hydrogen production. However, the large&#8208;scale commercialization of PEMWE faces challenges due to the need for acid oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts with long&#8208;term stability and corrosion&#8208;resistant membrane electrode assemblies (MEA). This review thoroughly examines the deactivation mechanisms of acidic OER and crucial factors affecting assembly instability in complex reaction environments, including catalyst degradation, dynamic behavior at the MEA triple&#8208;phase boundary, and equipment failures. Targeted solutions are proposed, including catalyst improvements, optimized MEA designs, and operational strategies. Finally, the review highlights perspectives on strict activity/stability evaluation standards, in situ/operando characteristics, and practical electrolyzer optimization. These insights emphasize the interrelationship between catalysts, MEAs, activity, and stability, offering new guidance for accelerating the commercialization of PEMWE catalysts and systems.

         <title>Heterostructured Electrocatalysts: from Fundamental Microkinetic Model to Electron Configuration and Interfacial Reactive Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructures have emerged as advanced electrocatalysts to convert earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. On the basis of atomistic understanding to accelerate the electrochemical processes, the architecture of heterostructured electrocatalysts is comprehensively discussed from the point of view of modulating electronic configuration and interface reactive microenvironment. The influence of rectification, space charge region, built&#8208;in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect is considered.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts can efficiently convert earth&#8208;abundant simple molecules into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products. In this context, heterostructures, which are largely determined by the interface, have emerged as a pivotal architecture for enhancing the activity of electrocatalysts. In this review, the atomistic understanding of heterostructured electrocatalysts is considered, focusing on the reaction kinetic rate and electron configuration, gained from both empirical studies and theoretical models. We start from the fundamentals of the microkinetic model, adsorption energy theory, and electric double layer model. The importance of heterostructures to accelerate electrochemical processes via modulating electron configuration and interfacial reactive microenvironment is highlighted, by considering rectification, space charge region, built&#8208;in electric field, synergistic interactions, lattice strain, and geometric effect. We conclude this review by summarizing the challenges and perspectives in the field of heterostructured electrocatalysts, such as the determination of transition state energy, their dynamic evolution, refinement of the theoretical approaches, and the use of machine learning.

         <title>Rapid Drying Principle for High&#8208;speed, Pinhole&#8208;Less, Uniform Wet Deposition Protocols of Water&#8208;Dispersed 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;speed and inexpensive deposition techniques are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. Rapid drying principle deriving hot dipping and air knife sweeping deposition protocols achieves film uniformity, scalability, and tunable thickness simultaneously by suppressing time for secondary flows. The large&#8208;area extendibility, pinhole&#8208;less feature, and m2&#160;min&#8722;1&#8208;level deposition speed offer unprecedented processes for 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices more cheaply.








Abstract
Inexpensive, high&#8208;speed deposition techniques that ensure uniformity, scalability, wide applicability, and tunable thickness are crucial for the practical application of 2D materials. In this work, rapid drying is identified as a key mechanism for pioneering two high&#8208;speed wet deposition methods: hot dipping and air knife sweeping (AKS). Both techniques allow thickness control proportional to flake concentration, achieving tiled monolayers and pinhole&#8208;free coverage across the entire substrate, as long as evaporation outpaces flake diffusion. AKS prevents non&#8208;uniformity along substrate edges by eliminating contact line pinning. The achieved deposition speed of 0.21 m2&#160;min&#8722;1 with AKS significantly surpasses traditional methods, enabling the equipment for large substrates &gt;&#160;1 m2. Combined with the ultralow debonding force for mechanically susceptible flexible display production and short&#8208;circuit&#8208;proof nanometer&#8208;thin capacitors with capacitance comparable to commercial multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), these new protocols showcase simple and swift solutions for manufacturing 2D materials&#8208;based nanodevices.

AKS prevents non-uniformity along substrate edges by eliminating contact line pinning. The achieved deposition speed of 0.21 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with AKS significantly surpasses traditional methods, enabling the equipment for large substrates &amp;gt;&#160;1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Combined with the ultralow debonding force for mechanically susceptible flexible display production and short-circuit-proof nanometer-thin capacitors with capacitance comparable to commercial multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), these new protocols showcase simple and swift solutions for manufacturing 2D materials-based nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Vacancy Confinement in Anatase TiO2 for Enhanced Photocatalytic Activities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to spatially confine oxygen vacancy (VO) is demonstrated in the homo&#8208;interface of anatase TiO2. The confined VO in anatase TiO2 not only exhibits metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility, but also promotes photocarrier lifetime. This synthetic strategy emphasizes how sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels in confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light&#8208;driven catalytic reactions.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven energy conversion devices call for the atomic&#8208;level manipulation of defects associated with electronic states in solids. However, previous approaches to produce oxygen vacancy (VO) as a source of sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels have hampered the precise control of the distribution and concentration of VO. Here, a new strategy to spatially confine VO at the homo&#8208;interfaces is demonstrated by exploiting the sequential growth of anatase TiO2 under dissimilar thermodynamic conditions. Remarkably, metallic behavior with high carrier density and electron mobility is observed after sequential growth of the TiO2 films under low pressure and temperature (L&#8208;TiO2) on top of high&#8208;quality anatase TiO2 epitaxial films (H&#8208;TiO2), despite the insulating properties of L&#8208;TiO2 and H&#8208;TiO2 single layers. Multiple characterizations elucidate that the VO layer is geometrically confined within 4 unit cells at the interface, along with low&#8208;temperature crystallization of upper L&#8208;TiO2 films; this 2D VO layer is responsible for the formation of in&#8208;gap states, promoting photocarrier lifetime (&#8776;300%) and light absorption. These results suggest a synthetic strategy to locally confine functional defects and emphasize how sub&#8208;bandgap energy levels in the confined imperfections influence the kinetics of light&#8208;driven catalytic reactions.

         <title>Epitaxial Ferroelectric Hexagonal Boron Nitride Grown on Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) multilayer films on graphene, synthesized on a miscut SiC (0001) substrate, is demonstrated using nitrogen plasma&#8208;assisted molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy. Robust ferroelectricity with switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization via interlayer sliding is supported by theoretical and experimental insights, providing a scalable pathway for integrating ferroelectric vdW materials into advanced 2D devices with diverse functionalities.








Abstract
Ferroelectricity realized in van der Waals (vdW) materials with non&#8208;centrosymmetric stacking configurations holds promise for future 2D devices with nonvolatile and reconfigurable functionalities. However, the epitaxial growth of ferroelectric vdW materials often struggles to achieve an energetically unfavorable stacking configuration that enables electric polarization. This challenge is particularly evident when performing heteroepitaxy on another vdW substrate to create versatile and scalable ferroelectric building blocks designed for large&#8208;area, atomic&#8208;scale thicknesses. Here, epitaxial hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) multilayer films are successfully grew on single&#8208;crystal graphene synthesized on a miscut SiC (0001) substrate. Theoretical calculations illustrate that the moir&#233;&#8208;patterned h&#8208;BN/graphene hetero&#8208;interface intrinsically exhibits polarization, leading to a polarized AB stacking in multilayer h&#8208;BN films to minimize the total formation energy, which is validated experimentally by the layer&#8208;dependent band dispersions. The as&#8208;grown multilayer h&#8208;BN layers demonstrated robust, homogeneous ferroelectricity with switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization via interlayer sliding. This study establishes an effective route for stacking&#8208;controlled heteroepitaxy, enabling the large&#8208;scale integration of vdW materials with ferroelectricity and versatile functionalities, offering a promising platform for next&#8208;generation 2D ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Unconventional Ferroelectric&#8208;Ferroelastic Switching Mediated by Non&#8208;Polar Phase in Fluorite Oxides</title>

The in situ atomic scale transmission electron microscopy experiment reveals a non&#8208;polar phase&#8208;mediated ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic coupled switching pathway in fluorite oxides.








Abstract
HfO2/ZrO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics present tremendous potential for next&#8208;generation non&#8208;volatile memory due to their high scalability and compatibility with silicon technology. Unlike the continuous polar layers in perovskite ferroelectrics, HfO2/ZrO2&#8208;based ferroelectrics are composed of alternating polar layers with oxygen shifts and non&#8208;polar spacers, which leads to a distinct ferroelectric switching mechanism. However, directly observing the switching process has been a big challenge due to the polymorph feature of nanoscale fluorites and the difficulty in in situ imaging on light elements. Here, the ferroelectric&#8208;ferroelastic coupled switching process in freestanding ZrO2 thin films is directly visualized by in situ imaging on oxygen motions. A multi&#8208;step 90&#8208;degree polarization switching mechanism is uncovered that challenges the conventional one&#8208;step 180&#8208;degree switching paradigms in fluorite oxides, which is highly consistent with the interlocked nature of ferroelectricity and ferroelasticity. A non&#8208;polar tetragonal (T) phase is discovered as a crucial intermediate state, lowering the energy barrier for polarization switching by 35%. More importantly, the T phase prevents irreversible transitions to the non&#8208;polar ground state and facilitates stable ferroelectric switching. These findings are fundamental to understanding nanoscale polarization switching mechanisms in fluorite ferroelectrics, paving the way for advanced high&#8208;durability devices.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Resistive Redox Mediator in Lithium&#8211;Oxygen Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic redox mediators (ORMs) reactive nature with 1O2 causes the functional degradation but the reactivity of ORMs is often neglected. The ORM is systematically designed, which has superior 1O2 stability than ORMs with similar molecular structures and promises enhanced cyclability sustaining its catalytic function. This work emphasizes the necessity of suitable design of ORMs and the importance of controlling 1O2.








Abstract
The utilization of redox mediators (RMs) in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries (LOBs) has underscored their utility in high overpotential during the charging process. Among the currently known RMs, it is exceptionally challenging to identify those with a redox potential capable of attenuating singlet oxygen (1O2) generation while resisting degradation by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as 1O2 and superoxide (O2&#8226;&#8722;). In this context, computational and experimental approaches for rational molecular design have led to the development of 7,7&#8242;&#8208;bi&#8208;7&#8208;azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (BAC), a newly suggested RM incorporating N&#8211;N interconnected aza&#8208;bicycles. BAC harnesses the advantages of falling within the potential range that suppresses 1O2 generation, as previously reported N&#8211;N embedded non&#8208;bicyclic RMs, and effectively defends against ROS&#8208;induced degradation due to the incorporation of a novel bicyclic moiety. Unlike the non&#8208;bicyclic RMs, which exhibit reduced O2 evolution after exposure to 1O2, BAC maintains consistent O2 profiles during charging, indicating its superior 1O2 resistance and steady redox&#8208;catalyst performance in LOBs. This study introduces a precise and rational design strategy for low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight RMs, marking a significant step forward in advancing LOB development by improving efficiency, stability, and practical applicability.

BAC harnesses the advantages of falling within the potential range that suppresses &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation, as previously reported N&#8211;N embedded non-bicyclic RMs, and effectively defends against ROS-induced degradation due to the incorporation of a novel bicyclic moiety. Unlike the non-bicyclic RMs, which exhibit reduced O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution after exposure to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, BAC maintains consistent O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; profiles during charging, indicating its superior &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resistance and steady redox-catalyst performance in LOBs. This study introduces a precise and rational design strategy for low-molecular-weight RMs, marking a significant step forward in advancing LOB development by improving efficiency, stability, and practical applicability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buckle&#8208;Barrel Correspondence Based on Topological Polarization Conversion in Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number XXXX, Jingyi Zhang, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers take a mechanical metamaterial approach to study topological transitions in the context of complex deformations. A buckle&#8208;barrel correspondence has been established that links local polarization conversions to global instabilities.








Abstract
Harnessing instabilities in architected lattices and metamaterials allows for controlled nonlinear deformations, enabling desired mechanical functions like shape morphing and energy absorption. By precisely tailoring instabilities such as buckling into the structure, deformations become a powerful instrument rather than a failure mode, offering new possibilities for predictable responses to mechanical loads. Inspired by the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence in condensed matter physics, an analogous relationship is explored in metamaterials, where the underlying topology dictates whether the structure under load buckles or barrels. The underlying mechanism that originates from a polarization conversion in the elementary beam network is discussed. Moreover, these predictions, which can be extended to more complex topologies and higher dimensions, showcase that a mode inversion process governs both global deformations and the orientation of localized shear strains within the bulk. It is anticipated that the buckle&#8208;barrel correspondence can be extended to non&#8208;Hookean materials, paving the way for predicting the onset and evolution of true&#160;failure.

         <title>Xantphos&#8211;Cu&#8208;Decorated Covalent Organic Frameworks for C&#9472;H Arylation through Sensitized Electron Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of a tetrahedral Cu(I) single site into the bipyridine&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) is shown to effectively drive photocatalytic carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation through simultaneous energy and electron transfer pathways. The COF&#8208;based photocatalyst demonstrates efficient and durable performance for the preparation of a series of oxindole and isoindolinones.








Abstract
The isoindolinone scaffold is an important structural motif found in a wide range of naturally occurring and synthetic biologically active compounds. However, the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives typically requires multi&#8208;step procedures or the use of palladium&#8208;based catalysts, which are often hampered by low reaction yields and high costs. Recently, covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8212;emerging crystalline and porous materials&#8212;have gained considerable attention for their applications in various organic transformations, particularly in C&#9472;H functionalization, cross&#8208;coupling and redox reactions. Although COFs have been extensively studied for photocatalysis, the development of sustainable heterogeneous catalysts using low&#8208;cost transition metal&#8208;based photosensitizers is still in its early stages. Herein, a strategy is presented to incorporate a copper&#8208;Xantphos complex with a tetrahedral Cu(I) geometry into a crystalline and porous COF matrix. This modification enables unprecedented simultaneous electron and energy transfer efficiency during photocatalysis. The Cu&#8211;Xantphos coordinated COF exhibits potent photocatalytic activity for the synthesis of isoindolinone derivatives via C&#9472;Br and C&#9472;H bond cleavage followed by C&#9472;C bond formation. In addition, the catalyst shows excellent recyclability as it can be rejuvenated by reintroducing the Cu&#8211;Xantphos complex after multiple photocatalytic cycles&#8212;highlighting its potential as a sustainable and cost&#8208;effective solution for valuable organic transformations.

         <title>3D Printed Materials with Nanovoxelated Elastic Moduli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D printing method enables the fabrication of materials with precisely controlled mechanical properties at nanoscale resolution. A volume&#8208;conserving photoresist combined with the free and open&#8208;source software, OpenScribe, achieves mechanical transitions over 770 nanometers &#8208; representing a 130&#8208;fold improvement over existing approaches. This advancement enables the creation of complex materials with unprecedented control over local elasticity.








Abstract
Fabrication methods that synthesize materials with higher precision and complexity at ever smaller scales are rapidly developing. Despite such advances, generating&#160;complex 3D materials with controlled mechanical properties at the nanoscale remains challenging. Exerting precise control over mechanical properties at the nanoscale would enable material strengths near theoretical maxima, and the replication of natural structures with hitherto unattainable strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios. Here, a method for fabricating materials with nanovoxelated elastic moduli by employing a volume&#8208;conserving photoresist composed of a copolymer hydrogel, along with OpenScribe, an open&#8208;source software that enables the precise programming of material mechanics, is presented. Combining these, a material composed of periodic unit cells featuring heteromechanically tessellated soft&#8208;stiff structures, achieving a mechanical transition over an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude change in elastic modulus within 770&#160;nm, a 130&#8208;fold improvement on previous reports, is demonstrated. This work critically advances material design and opens new avenues for fabricating materials with specifically tailored properties and functionalities through unparalleled control over nanoscale mechanics.

         <title>Gasotransmitter&#8208;Nanodonor for Spatial Regulation of Anxiety&#8208;Like Behavior and Bone Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The gasotransmitter&#8208;nanodonor FSG@AB co&#8208;releases hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) and glucose oxidase (GOx) at bone metastases, disrupting mitochondrial function and inhibiting glycolysis to deplete tumor energy sources, exerting robust anti&#8208;tumor effects. The released H&#8322;S travels to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), upregulating glutamate transporter 1 (GLT&#8208;1) expression, reducing extracellular glutamate levels, and mitigating glutamatergic hyperactivity, ultimately alleviating anxiety&#8208;like behaviors.








Abstract
Anxiety is highly prevalent among cancer patients, significantly impacting their prognosis. Current cancer therapies typically lack anxiolytic properties and may even exacerbate anxiety. Here, a gasotransmitter&#8208;nanodonors (GND) system is presented that exerts dual anxiolytic and anti&#8208;tumor effects via a &#8220;tumor&#8208;brain axis&#8221; strategy. The GND, synthesized by co&#8208;embedding Fe2&#8314; and S2&#8315; ions along with glucose oxidase (GOx) within bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (FSG@AB), enables the controlled release of the gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S) in the acidic tumor microenvironment. H&#8322;S and GOx synergistically deplete tumor energy sources, resulting in robust anti&#8208;tumor effects. Meanwhile, H&#8322;S generated at the tumor site is transported through the bloodstream to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the brain, where it modulates neuronal activity. Specifically, in the ACC, H&#8322;S upregulates glutamate transporter 1 (GLT&#8208;1), which reduces extracellular glutamate levels and attenuates the hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons, thereby alleviating anxiety&#8208;like behavior. This study proposes a GND system that targets both oncological and psychiatric dimensions of cancer through the &#8220;tumor&#8208;brain axis&#8221; strategy, resulting in improved therapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Frozen by Heating: Temperature Controlled Dynamic States in Droplet Microswimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the design of smart materials based on active agents or microswimmers, the gaits or motile states of the agents are to be controlled, preferably by external parameters that do not require modifying the composition of the system. A facile, universal parameter is temperature. Here, in the experimental model system of self&#8208;propelling active emulsions, a temperature sensitive mixture of co&#8208;surfactants is used as fuel for propulsion. It is demonstrated that three distinct states of reorienting, then straight motion, and subsequent arrest, can be accessed, counterintuitively, with increasing temperature.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, an experimental system of self&#8208;propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states is presented, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P&#233;clet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which can now be tuned by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. The droplet dynamics are quantified by analyzing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self&#8208;propelled&#160;motility, is experimentally demonstrated.

         <title>Engineering Ultra&#8208;Small Ag Nanoparticles with Enhanced Activity in Microporous Polymer Membranes for C2H4/C2H6 Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small silver nanoparticles are formed in situ and activated in an amidoxime&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity to fabricate a metallic nanocomposite membrane for C2H4/C2H6 separation. The activated silver nanoparticles promote C2H4 transport and effectively enhance C2H4/C2H6 separation selectivity, resulting in an outstanding membrane separation performance with C2H4 permeability of 322.1 barrer and C2H4/C2H6 selectivity as high as 8.8.








Abstract
The separation of C2H4 and C2H6 is a critical yet energy&#8208;intensive operation in the petrochemical industry. Gas separation membranes offer energy&#8208;efficient alternatives, but their effectiveness is hindered by the similar physical properties of C2H4 and C2H6. Here, a metallic nanocomposite membrane (MNM) comprising ultra&#8208;small Ag nanoparticles embedded in an amidoxime&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (AOPIM&#8208;1) is reported for highly efficient C2H4/C2H6 separation. The microporous structure of AOPIM&#8208;1, combined with anchoring groups (amidoxime groups) inside the microcavities, enables size&#8208;controlled growth of Ag nanoparticles with &#8210;&#8776;3&#160;nm diameter, which maximizes the contact with ethylene molecules. The amidoxime groups as electron acceptors effectively enrich the positive charge on the surface of Ag nanoparticles. The activated Ag form reversible complexes with ethylene molecules endowing them with preferential affinity over ethane. The resulting Ag nanocomposite membrane demonstrates a &#8776;10&#8208;fold increase in C2H4 permeability, reaching 322.1 barrer, and a &#8776;3&#8208;fold increase in C2H4/C2H6 selectivity, reaching 8.8. The comprehensive separation performance is superior over all the polymer membranes and mixed matrix membranes reported so far. The MNMs also demonstrate stable mixed gas separation performance under elevated feed gas pressures. This study provides valuable insights into designing and fabricating polymer membranes with high C2H4/C2H6 separation performance.

         <title>Antibody&#8208;level Bacteria Grabbing by &#8220;Mechanic Invasion&#8221; of Bioinspired Hedgehog Artificial Mesoporous Nanostructure for Hierarchical Dynamic Identification and Light&#8208;Response Sterilization</title>

         <dc:description>
Through the de novo design of bioinspired hedgehog artificial mesoporous nanostructure with virus&#8208;like spiky topography (mAPt), the antibody&#8208;level bacteria grabbing attributed to the &#8220;mechanic invasion&#8221;&#8208;induced hierarchical dynamic identification ranging from rough surface contact to penetration fixation is verified. Further integrated with spiky&#8208;induced near&#8208;superblack characteristic and plasmonic &#8220;hot spot&#8221;, mAPt enables advanced applications in immunoassay and photothermal sterilization.








Abstract
The interactions exploration between microorganisms and nanostructures are pivotal steps toward advanced applications, but the antibody&#8208;level bacteria grabbing is limited by the poor understanding of interface identification mechanisms in small&#8208;sized systems. Herein, the de novo design of a bioinspired hedgehog artificial mesoporous nanostructure (core&#8211;shell mesoporous Au@Pt (mAPt)) are proposed to investigate the association between the topography design and efficient bacteria grabbing. These observations indicate that virus&#8208;like spiky topography compensates for the obstacles faced by small&#8208;sized materials for bacteria grabbing, including the lack of requisite microscopic cavities and sufficient contact area. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals that spiky topography with heightened mechano&#8208;invasiveness (6.56&#160;&#215;&#160;103 KJ mol&#8722;1) facilitates antibody&#8208;level bacteria grabbing, attributed to the &#8220;mechanic invasion&#8221;&#8208;induced hierarchical dynamic identification ranging from rough surface contact to penetration fixation. Furthermore, light reflectance and finite element calculation confirmed that mAPt exhibits near&#8208;superblack characteristic and plasmonic hot spot, facilitating enhanced photothermal conversion with power dissipation density at 2.04&#160;&#215;&#160;1021&#160;W m&#8722;3. After integrating the hierarchical dynamic identification with enhanced light response, mAPt enables advanced applications in immunoassay with 50&#8208;fold sensitivity enhancement and over 99.99% in vitro photothermal sterilization. It is anticipated that this novel biomimetic design provides a deeper understanding of bacteria grabbing and a promising paradigm for bacteria combating.

         <title>Cholesterol Cocrystal Ferroelectrics Modulated by Solvent Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ferroelectric cocrystals of cholesterol methanol (CHOL&#8208;MeOH) and cholesterol ethanol (CHOL&#8208;EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect, where the introduction of hydroxyl&#8208;containing solvents like methanol and ethanol can induce ferroelectricity in cholesterol by reducing the O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond length as well as largely decreasing the maximum energy barrier for polarization reversal.








Abstract
Cholesterol (CHOL) is an inherently biodegradable material with multiple chiral centers, being an essential component for cell membranes. Considering the close relationship between chirality and ferroelectric feature, this compound with chiral&#8208;polar structure is an intrinsic polar material. However, the ferroelectricity of CHOL crystals has never been found to date. Herein, a series of ferroelectric cocrystals of CHOL methanol (CHOL&#8208;MeOH) and CHOL ethanol (CHOL&#8208;EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect. It is found that the introduction of some solvent molecules containing hydroxyls such as methanol and ethanol can reduce the acceptor&#183;&#183;&#183;donor length and thus form a 1D electroactive channel and further induce ferroelectricity in CHOL. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation analyses represented by CHOL&#8208;EtOH, the largely decreased maximum energy barrier for the polarization reversal of &#8776;50% suggests that the electric polarization of the cocrystal is much easier to be reoriented under the external electric field through the solvent effect. These ferroelectric materials show good biocompatibility and biodegradability through in vitro and in vivo evaluation. These attributes make these CHOL cocrystals good candidates for the application of next&#8208;generation smart implantable electronic devices. This work sheds light on the chemical design of biodegradable ferroelectrics in biomaterials.

         <title>Strong Proquinoidal Acceptor Enables High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proquinoidal building blocks are demonstrated that could enable a narrow bandgap while facilitating the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, making them ideal for high&#8208;performance ambipolar OECTs. Using this strategy, a record&#8208;breaking ambipolar OECT material featuring high &#181;C*, low operating voltage, and rapid response is developed.








Abstract
Ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) can simplify manufacturing processes and reduce device footprints, yet their performance still lags behind their p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type counterparts due to limited molecular design strategies. Here, incorporating strong proquinoidal building blocks effectively addresses this challenge is demonstrated. Using a computational acceptor screening approach, three TBDOPV&#8208;based polymers are designed and synthesized: P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;T), P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT), and P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;MeOT2), all exhibiting ambipolar behavior across various donor moieties. Remarkably, P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) achieves record&#8208;high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) values, reaching 268&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and 107&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type operations. Additionally, P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) exhibits low operation voltages (VTh,p&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.55&#160;V and VTh,n&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;V), with fast response times (&#964;on/&#964;off = 0.48/0.36&#160;ms for p&#8208;type and 0.41/0.41&#160;ms for n&#8208;type) and enhanced operational stability. Inverter devices based on P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) show high voltage gains of 173&#160;V/V. Theoretical calculations and data analysis confirm that strong proquinoidal acceptors significantly enhance the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, offering an effective pathway for higher&#8208;performance ambipolar OECT materials.

         <title>Deciphering the Purification Additive Chemistries for Ultra&#8208;Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

This work deciphers the fundamental factors and proposes a general design rule for screening hydrogen fluoride (HF)&#8208;elimination additives. The cherry&#8208;picked additive according to this rule enables a remarkable success in protecting electrodes and interphases over high&#8208;voltage LIBs.









Abstract
Hydrogen fluoride (HF)&#8208;induced degradation of electrode materials and interphases presents a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, progress in developing advanced HF&#8208;scavenging additives is hindered by a limited understanding of HF&#8208;elimination reactions and the absence of a robust design principle. Herein, it is proposed to analyze the energy decomposition analysis of 24 additives to elucidate the underlying HF&#8208;scavenging mechanism and identify key factors influencing HF&#8208;additives reactions. The findings reveal that orbital contribution ratio (OCR) is a critical determinant of chemical bonding in HF&#8208;additive reactions. Specifically, an 80% OCR for H+ and a 53% OCR for F&#8722; are essential for completing HF elimination. Based on these insights, a general principle for designing effective HF&#8208;elimination additives is proposed and heptamethyldisilazane as a particularly well&#8208;suited candidate, exhibiting optimal OCR for both H+ and F&#8722; ions is identified. Remarkably, the addition of just 1&#160;wt.% HMDS significantly eliminats HF, inhibiting cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crosstalk behaviors and limiting electrode and interphase degradation. This guardian endows graphite/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells with a significant performance improvement, achieving 80% capacity retention over 2528 cycles, a substantial improvement compared to the 1139 cycles observed without HF&#8208;elimination additive. The study provides valuable insights for the design of advanced electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Radical Molecular Network&#8208;Buffer Minimizes Photovoltage Loss in FAPbI&#8323; Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerizable radical molecule (ATEMPO) preferentially interacting with the {111}c facets, is employed as an additive to promote perovskite crystal growth. During annealing, ATEMPO polymerizes, forming a network&#8208;buffer that mitigates lattice strain and suppresses intragrain planar defects. This strategy yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, minimizing photovoltage loss in FAPbI&#8323; perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&#8323;) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold immense potential for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics, but maximizing their open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) remains challenging. Targeting the inherently stable {111}c&#8208;dominant facets is a promising approach for enhancing stability, but their formation typically suffers from high defect densities and disordered growth. This study introduces a novel approach using an in situ polymerizable radical molecule, ATEMPO, as an additive to address these issues. ATEMPO preferentially interacts with the {111}c perovskite facets, guiding their growth and forming a &#8220;radical molecular network&#8208;buffer&#8221; upon polymerization. The network effectively mitigates lattice strain, suppresses defect formation, enhances charge transport via redox&#8208;mediated hopping, and provides a hydrophobic barrier, significantly improving moisture resistance. This strategy yields high&#8208;quality, {111}c &#8208;oriented FAPbI&#8323; films, leading to a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, corresponding to an energy loss (Eloss) of only 0.297 eV, among the highest VOC reported for FAPbI&#8323;&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a mini&#8208;module fabricate with an active area of 12.5 cm2 achieve a high PCE of 21.39%. the work paves the way for developing high&#8208;performance, stable PSCs with minimized photovoltage loss. Furthermore, it offers a promising strategy to enhance device longevity and address environmental concerns.

Spatiotemporal Controlled Release Inks of Biocompatible polyEsters (SCRIBE) is a novel 2PP resin family with sub&#8208;micron resolution and tuneable hydrolysis. SCRIBE enables direct printing of hollow microparticles with complex chemistries and geometries inaccessible to molding techniques, which are used to modulate antibody titers and class switching as a function of antigen release rate in vivo.









Abstract
Two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing enables top&#8211;down biomaterial synthesis with nanoscale spatial resolution for de novo design of monodisperse injectable drug delivery systems. Spatiotemporal Controlled Release Inks of Biocompatible polyEsters (SCRIBE) is a novel poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid)&#8208;triacrylate resin family with sub&#8208;micron resolution and tuneable hydrolysis that addresses the limitations of current 2PP resins. SCRIBE enables the direct printing of hollow microparticles with tuneable chemistry and complex geometries inaccessible to molding techniques, which are used to engineer controlled protein release in vitro and in vivo. SCRIBE microparticles are used to modulate antibody titers and class switching as a function of antigen release rate and extend these findings to enable a single&#8208;injection vaccine formulation with extended antibody induction kinetics. Demonstrating how the chemistry and computer&#8208;aided design of 2PP&#8208;printed microparticles can be used to tune responses to biomacromolecule release in vivo opens significant opportunities for a new generation of drug delivery vehicles.

         <title>Fully Recyclable Pluripotent Networks for 3D Printing Enabled by Dissociative Dynamic Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pluripotent materials, i.e., materials that can attain different properties from a single stock, where applied to 3D printing. Their accessibility is expanded using a monomer that is CO2&#8208;derived and is prepared at the 100&#8208;gram scale. Exploiting pluripotency, spatially patterned 3D objects are produced showcasing new direction for the additive manufacturing community.








Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM) has risen in popularity due to its ability to produce complex shapes in a material&#8208;efficient way. However, to produce objects with advanced properties, complex multimaterial strategies are often employed. This one&#8208;polymer&#8208;one&#8208;property paradigm significantly slows down the application of AM, and in particular of fused deposition modeling (FDM), for manufacturing of functional objects. In this study advantage of pluripotency in materials is taken, i.e., the ability to attain different properties from a single stock, to afford mechanically tunable 3D printed dynamic thermosets (moduli from 2&#160;MPa &#8211; 3&#160;GPa, 1500&#215; increase, Stress at break from 2 to 70&#160;MPa, 35&#215; increase). To do so, FDM&#8208;compatible CO2&#8208;derived dissociative polymer networks are designed that undergo a dynamic reaction&#8208;induced phase&#8208;separation (DRIPS). This strategy enables the control of the size of the rigid phase with a simple post&#8208;printing thermal treatment, cascading in spatially patterned mechanical properties. This study showcases new directions for the 3D printing communities, with deep implications in soft robotics and compliant mechanics.

         <title>Organomolecular Ferroelectric Nanocatalyst Augments Tumor Immunotherapy by Inducing Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a biodegradable organomolecular ferroelectric nanoplatform to facilitate effective ferroelectric nanocatalyst catalysis for augmented tumor immunotherapy through inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis.








Abstract
Immunogenic programmed cell death effectively triggers acute inflammatory responses, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity. The advancement of biodegradable nonmetallic dual inducers represents a promising strategy. Herein, a biodegradable organomolecular ferroelectric nanoplatform (C60&#8208;TCNQ, CT) is designed to facilitate effective ferroelectric catalysis, thereby augmenting tumor immunotherapy through apoptosis and ferroptosis. CT&#8208;mediated ultrasound&#8208;triggered ferroelectric catalysis promotes ferroelectric polarization and significantly increases the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to substantial tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, the polycyano group of CT nanoparticles selectively reacts with cysteine under mild conditions, resulting in redox imbalances and the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which contribute to the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the apoptosis and ferroptosis induced by CT stimulate immunogenic cell death progression, eliciting robust immune responses. In vivo evaluation using a bilateral tumor model demonstrates the capacity of CT to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy under ultrasound irradiation, achieving an impressive antitumor response rate of 96.2% against malignant melanoma and an 80% inhibition of tumor metastasis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that treatment with CT resulted in a downregulation of gene signatures associated with the immune&#8208;related Jak&#8208;Stat signaling pathway. This study opens a novel avenue to developing organomolecular ferroelectric nanomedicines for effective tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Cooling&#8208;induced Strains in 2D Materials and Their Modulation via Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the internal and external cooling&#8208;induced strains in monolayer MoSe2 at cryogenic temperatures, focusing on strain effects arising from thermal expansion coefficient mismatch at 2D&#8208;bulk interfaces. Interface engineering demonstrates that compressive strain induces direct&#8208;to&#8208;indirect bandgap transitions. Notably, hexagonal boron nitride encapsulation effectively mitigates external strain via 2D&#8211;2D interfaces, yielding performance comparable to suspended samples.








Abstract
2D materials exhibit unique properties for next&#8208;generation electronics and quantum devices. However, their sensitivity to temperature variations, particularly concerning cooling&#8208;induced strain, remains underexplored systematically. This study investigates the effects of cooling&#8208;induced strain on monolayer MoSe2 at cryogenic temperatures. It is emphasized that the mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients between the material and bulk substrate leads to significant external strain, which superimposes the internal strain of the material. By engineering the material&#8208;substrate 2D&#8208;bulk interface, the resulting strain conditions are characterized and reveal that substantial compressive strain induces new emission features linked to direct&#8208;to&#8208;indirect bandgap transition, as confirmed by photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy studies. Finally, it is demonstrated that encapsulation with hexagonal boron nitride can mitigate the external strain by 2D&#8211;2D interfaces, achieving results similar to those of suspended samples. The findings address key challenges in quantifying and characterizing strain types across different 2D&#8208;bulk interfaces, distinguishing cooling&#8208;induced strain effects from other temperature&#8208;dependent phenomena, and designing strain&#8208;sensitive 2D material devices for extreme temperature conditions.

         <title>Exploring Structure Diversity in Atomic Resolution Microscopy With Graph</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a few&#8208;shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network to automatically analyze a library of atomic structures (vacancies, grain boundaries, stacking configurations, etc.) represented by graphs. This framework significantly promotes robustness, reduces computing parameters by three orders of magnitude compared to the image&#8208;driven learning framework, and facilitates new structure and knowledge discovery.








Abstract
The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high&#8208;throughput analysis of atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, a few&#8208;shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.) is described, showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image&#8208;driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic&#8208;scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self&#8208;assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub&#8208;models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.

         <title>LiF&#8208;Rich Cathode Electrolyte Interphases Homogenizing Li+ Fluxes toward Stable Interface in Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel vapor phase method is first proposed to reconstruct a robust LiF coating layer on the Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase&#160;(CEI). The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes on the electrode surface, contributing to a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Constructing a stable cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial to enhance the battery performance of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based oxide (LMO) cathodes. To achieve an ideal CEI, a gas&#8208;phase fluorination technique is proposed to pre&#8208;structure a robust LiF layer (&#8776;1&#160;nm) on the LMO surface. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface and mitigates undesirable side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer on the LMO&#8208;F&#8208;1. The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li+ fluxes across the electrode surface and enhances Li+ diffusion in the electrode during (de)intercalation, contributing to a stable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface. Moreover, the robust LiF&#8208;rich CEI layer effectively suppresses the decomposition of lithium salts in the electrolyte and reduces autocatalytic side reactions triggered by the by&#8208;products. In addition, it improves the structural stability of LMO by increasing the formation energies of oxygen and manganese vacancies. As a result, the modified LMO with the LiF&#8208;rich CEI retains 95% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability. The proposed gas&#8208;phase Li+ flux homogenization strategy offers a promising avenue for enhancing the interface stability of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials with lithium storage.

&lt;p&gt;A novel vapor phase method is first proposed to reconstruct a robust LiF coating layer on the Li-rich Mn-based oxide cathodes. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF-rich cathode electrolyte interphase&#160;(CEI). The optimized CEI facilitates homogeneous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fluxes on the electrode surface, contributing to a stable electrode-electrolyte interface.

&lt;p&gt;Constructing a stable cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) is crucial to enhance the battery performance of Li-rich Mn-based oxide (LMO) cathodes. To achieve an ideal CEI, a gas-phase fluorination technique is proposed to pre-structure a robust LiF layer (&#8776;1&#160;nm) on the LMO surface. The designed LiF layer effectively modulates the electric field distribution on the electrode surface and mitigates undesirable side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, thereby promoting the formation of a uniform LiF-rich CEI layer on the LMO-F-1.

In addition, it improves the structural stability of LMO by increasing the formation energies of oxygen and manganese vacancies. As a result, the modified LMO with the LiF-rich CEI retains 95% of its initial capacity after 100 cycles, demonstrating remarkable electrochemical stability.

         <title>Stereoisomerism of Vicinal Polydichloronorbornene for Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stereoisomerism engineering plays a crucial role in tailoring the properties of vicinal dichloronorbornene (PDCNB), with profound effects in backbone spacing, &#960;&#8208;stacking, barrier height, and trap states, empowering PDCNB with superior capacitive performance that outperforms existing polymers and nanocomposites in capacitive energy storage at 250 &#176;C.








Abstract
The emergence of high&#8208;density electronics in aerospace and renewable energies demands high temperature dielectrics. Molecular engineering represents a vital strategy for designing dielectric polymers, yet the influence of stereochemistry remains untapped. Herein, by designing halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant attached to a bicyclic mainchain, vicinal polydichloronorbornene (PDCNB) with a high glass&#8208;transition temperature (Tg) of 263&#160;&#176;C is obtained. Further study unveils the profound effect of stereochemistry on the properties of exo&#8208; and endo&#8208;PDCNB. Both isomers show identical high Tg and bandgap (4.3 eV), imparting PDCNBs with remarkable capacitive energy storage, outperforming existing polymers and nanocomposites with two orders of magnitude lower conduction at an ultra&#8208;high temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the effect of stereoisomerism is manifested in the differences in backbone spacing, &#960;&#8208;stacking, barrier height, and trap states, and the resulting distinct high field performance. Exo&#8208;PDCNB displays an extremely low conduction of 6.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14 S&#160;m&#8315;1 at 200 mV&#160;m&#8315;1 and maintains a record charge&#8208;discharge efficiency of 82% at 450 mV&#160;m&#8315;1, while endo&#8208;PDCNB exhibits a high breakdown strength of 600 mV&#160;m&#8315;1 with a remarkable discharged density of 4.47 J&#160;cm&#8315;3, all at 250 &#176;C. This study unleashes a stereochemistry&#8208;based strategy with vicinal dichloro substitution to further boost the Tg of polynorbornene for ultra&#8208;high&#8208;temperature&#160;applications.

         <title>Quantum Geometric Moment Encodes Stacking Order of Moir&#233; Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Berry curvature dipole (BCD) changes across valley Chern transitions. A new electrical technique is developed to use such BCD sign flips for distinguishing the stacking order of a moir&#233; material, namely twisted double bilayer graphene. Such a method, analogous to spectroscopic techniques, establishes a link between quantum geometry and stacking order, and is applicable to other moir&#233; materials.








Abstract
Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moir&#233; materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moir&#233; materials that break either time&#8208;reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4&#176; twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB&#8208;AB, AB&#8208;BA) and forms an inversion broken moir&#233; superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB&#8208;AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB&#8208;BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking&#8208;induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and&#160;detection.

         <title>Strong Metal&#8208;Support Interaction to Invert Hydrogen Evolution Overpotential of Cu Coating for High&#8208;Coulombic&#8208;Efficiency Stable Zn Anode in Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inherently small HER overpotential of Cu is reversed by strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) to modulate the electronic structure of the coating surface, thereby overturning the high HER tendency of Cu unsolved in previous Cu metal/alloy&#8208;based Zn anode protection strategies. This revolution enables an impressive 99.11% CE of Zn plating/stripping at very harsh conditions (0.2 mA cm&#8315;2) in asymmetric cells, as well as long cycle life (1400 h) and high DOD (51.7%) at 30 mA cm&#8315;2 in symmetric cells.








Abstract
Cu exhibits strong zincophilic properties but suffers from a much lower hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) overpotential compared to Zn, which significantly undermines the coulombic efficiency and stability of the Zn anode. Consequently, Cu is regarded as an unsuitable coating for Zn anode protection. In this work, the HER overpotential of Cu versus Zn is inverted through strong metal&#8208;support interaction (SMSI) to modify the electronic structure of Cu. This interaction facilitates electron transfer, enriching positive charge and slowing down the adsorption kinetics of H+ on the Cu surface. As a result, at very low current densities of 0.2 and 2 mA cm&#8315;2, the Cu&#8208;coated&#8208;Zn||Cu cell achieves exceptionally high coulombic efficiencies of 99.11% and 99.91% over 2500 and 1600 h of cycling (100% depth of discharge (DOD)), which remarkably surpasses the performance of Zn anode protective coatings all reported. Moreover, a 1 Ah soft&#8208;packed full battery is not bulged and retains 94.7% of its initial capacity after 150 cycles. This study overturns the conventional concept by leveraging SMSI to tune the electronic structure, reverses the HER overpotential, and expands the range of viable metals for anode protection in aqueous metal batteries.

QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1 and QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;2 isomers were synthesized for the construction of sequential stimuli&#8208;response (SSR) system. Solvent&#8208;driven structural transformation of the two isomers into QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 occurred, accompanied by the solid color changes from white to yellow and emergence of new emission band centered at 495 nm. Furthermore, yellow QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 powder transformed into brown QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;4 powder upon light illumination.








Abstract
Multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive materials hold excellent potential for the next generation smart materials owing to their unique response to external stimuli, providing a powerful impetus for the development of intelligent optical devices. The stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior of common multiple stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are independent of each other, causing the lack of multiplicity and identification for information technology, which is easy to decode. Herein, QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1 and QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;2 isomers were prepared from QIPA and EuCl3&#183;6H2O in different solvent thermal conditions for building sequential stimuli&#8208;response (SSR) system. Solvent&#8208;driven structural transformations of the isomers into QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 occurred, along with color change and fluorescence emission variation ascribed to the generation of QIPA aggregates. Furthermore, QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;3 displayed excellent photochromic behaviors. Combining theoretical calculation with well&#8208;defined experiments to reveal the mechanism, it was found that light drove the change in the dihedral angles between the quinoline nucleus and adjacent benzene rings in QIPA aggregates. Finally, on the basis of sequential stimuli&#8208;induced stepwise responsive behavior of QIPA&#8208;Eu&#8208;1, the sequential logic gate and time&#8208;dependent fluorescence dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting pattern were successfully constructed. This study provided a new perspective for design and construction of SSR system, which showed promising potential in the fields of data transmission and information encryption.

         <title>Biomimetic rhCOL17&#8208;P334 Conjugate for Enhanced Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel bioscaffold combining recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) with porphyra&#8208;334 (P334) to create a transparent, injectable hydrogel (GCP) for enhanced wound healing. GCP integrates extracellular matrix&#8208;like cues with UVA shielding properties, preventing fibroblast senescence and improving repair outcomes. This platform offers significant potential for advanced, protective wound management.








Abstract
Wound healing remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions annually and imposing substantial economic burdens. Most commercially available biomaterials for wound management primarily address external symptoms, including hemostasis, exudation, scarring, and infection. Advanced biomaterials derived from endogenous molecules aim to better replicate the native wound microenvironment, promoting enhanced repair. Since wounds frequently occur on exposed skin, which is vulnerable to UVA radiation and requires protective yet invisible materials, traditional wound care products often lack these essential features. Inspired by natural UV protection mechanisms, a novel bioscaffold is developed using recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) crosslinked with porphyra&#8208;334 (P334) to improve wound healing under UVA exposure. The resulting rhCOL17&#8208;P334 conjugate integrates extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;like cues with UVA&#8208;shielding properties provided by P334. This conjugate is used to construct a transparent, injectable hydrogel combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and rhCOL17&#8208;P334 (GCP). GCP significantly inhibits UVA&#8208;induced fibroblast senescence and improves wound healing outcomes by targeting integrin &#945;6&#946;4 through rhCOL17. Its transparency facilitates convenient wound monitoring while also addressing the aesthetic requirement for invisibility. By combining UVA shielding with wound repair capabilities, GCP presents a promising platform for advanced wound management.

         <title>Electrolyte Chemistry Modulation Toward High&#8208;Performance and Ultralow&#8208;Temperature Silicon Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategic electrolyte design principle is reported to enhance the electrochemical performance of Si anode at subzero temperature (e.g., &#8804; &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C). The combination of cyclopentylmethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran solvents simultaneously enables enhanced electrode reaction kinetics and interfacial stability, including high cation conductivity, low Li&#8208;ion desolvation barrier, and formation of robust LiF&#8208;rich solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase with polymer outer layer.








Abstract
The high&#8208;capacity silicon (Si) anode usually suffers from rapid capacity decay and low Coulombic efficiency in carbonate electrolytes resulting from large volume expansion and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). In addition, the sluggish electrode kinetics in routine electrolytes at subzero temperatures severely hampers the operational capabilities of Si&#8208;based batteries. Herein, a rational electrolyte design strategy is reported to tune the solvation chemistry and interfacial behavior of the electrolyte for high&#8208;performance Si anode. The interfacial stability and electrochemical reaction kinetics can be enhanced simultaneously at both room temperature and ultralow temperature by combining two kinds of ether&#8208;based solvents (cyclopentylmethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran), which enables high cation conductivity, low Li&#8208;ion desolvation barrier, and formation of a robust LiF&#8208;elastic polymer SEI. Consequently, the optimized electrolyte extends the cyclability of the Si anode, maintaining more than 80% capacity retention over 200 cycles at &#8722;20 and &#8722;35&#160;&#176;C. Even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, the Si electrode still delivers a high reversible capacity of 2157.0 mAh g&#8722;1, showing the highest capacity retention of 68.5% up to date relative to its room&#8208;temperature capacity. Moreover, the assembled full cells Si||LiFePO4 and Si||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance with no capacity degradation over 180 and 120 cycles, respectively, at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C.

The nanoplatform based on engineered attenuated OMVs has good biosafety and can cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep&#8208;2. The co&#8208;delivery of doxorubicin and CD47&#8208;siRNA and the immunogenicity of OMVs synergistically overcome the intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance of GBM, which ultimately triggers a powerful antitumor immune response.








Abstract
Apart from the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), the efficacy of immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) is limited by the presence of intrinsic and adaptive immune resistance, implying that co&#8208;delivery of various immunotherapeutic agents or simultaneous regulation of different cells is urgently needed. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) offer a unique advantage in the treatment of GBM, owing to their multifunctional properties as carriers and immune adjuvants and their ability to cross the BBB. However, traditional OMVs can lead to toxic side effects and disruption of tight junctions in the BBB. Therefore, to enhance the in vivo safety and targeting capability of OMVs, we introduced engineered OMVs to reduce toxicity and further constructed a modularly assembled nanoplatform by performing simple peptide modifications. This nanoplatform demonstrates satisfactory biosafety and is able to continuously cross the BBB and target GBM with the assistance of Angiopep&#8208;2. Subsequently, immunogenic substances on OMVs, along with carried small&#8208;interfering RNA (siRNA) and doxorubicin, can promote and enhance the reprogramming and phagocytic abilities of macrophages and microglia, respectively, and increase the immunogenicity of GBM, ultimately overcoming GBM immune resistance to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy. This OMVs&#8208;based nanoplatform provides a new paradigm and insights into the development of immunotherapy for GBM.

         <title>Directly Printed 3D Soft Microwave Plasmonic Enhanced&#8208;Q Resonators by Decoupling from Lossy Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional 2D plasmonic resonators are limited to be employed onto soft electronic platforms owing to the attenuation caused by lossy media. To overcome this, directly printed 3D plasmonic resonator configurations are developed with highly conductive elastomeric composites. These 3D soft resonators demonstrate wireless, multidirectional strain&#8208;sensing capabilities with higher quality factor resonances than their 2D counterparts, enabling advanced sensing applications.









Abstract
Soft electronic components are essential building blocks for realizing form&#8208;factor&#8208;free applications; however, most designs are confined to 2D or 2.5D structures due to challenges in maintaining 3D structural integrity.

&lt;p&gt;Traditional 2D plasmonic resonators are limited to be employed onto soft electronic platforms owing to the attenuation caused by lossy media. To overcome this, directly printed 3D plasmonic resonator configurations are developed with highly conductive elastomeric composites. These 3D soft resonators demonstrate wireless, multidirectional strain-sensing capabilities with higher quality factor resonances than their 2D counterparts, enabling advanced sensing applications.

&lt;p&gt;Soft electronic components are essential building blocks for realizing form-factor-free applications; however, most designs are confined to 2D or 2.5D structures due to challenges in maintaining 3D structural integrity. This limitation is particularly critical for electromagnetic devices, such as resonators, where dielectric losses from elastomeric substrates severely hinder high-performance functionality. Here, directly printed 3D electromagnetic soft plasmonic enhanced-quality(Q) factor resonators are proposed, using highly conductive composites.

         <title>Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis for High&#8208;Efficiency LiCl/Cl2 Conversion in Rechargeable Lithium&#8208;Chlorine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>

A Co single&#8208;atom catalyst (Co&#8208;N&#8324;) enhances Cl&#8322; adsorption and lowers LiCl reaction barriers in Li&#8208;Cl&#8322; batteries. The Li&#8208;Cl&#8322;@Co&#8208;NC battery exhibits &gt;600 cycles at 1500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at room temperature and 650 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8315;&#185; at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, with a 0.6 V reduction in polarization voltage. This strategy delivers high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;Cl&#8322; batteries with wide temperature adaptability.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;chlorine (Li&#8208;Cl2) secondary batteries are emerging as promising candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources and an extensive operational temperature range. However, conventional electrode materials suffer from weak adsorption for&#160;chlorine gas (Cl2) and low conversion efficiency of lithium chloride (LiCl), leading to significant loss of chlorine&#8208;based active materials. This issue hampers the cyclability of Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries. In this work, it is demonstrated that synergistic Cl2 adsorption on the electrode surface and the energy barrier for LiCl reactions are crucial for enhancing Cl2/LiCl conversion efficiency. Consequently, a cobalt (Co) single&#8208;atom site catalyst with a Co&#8208;N4 coordination environment has been developed, which significantly diminishes the transformation barrier of solid LiCl particles into Cl2 and concurrently enhances the chemical adsorption of Cl2, facilitating uniform nucleation of LiCl. As a result, the Li&#8208;Cl2@Co&#8208;NC battery developed has achieved a 0.6&#160;V reduction in polarization voltage under high current densities, effectively addressing the issue of low conversion efficiency between Cl2 and LiCl. At room temperature, the Li&#8208;Cl2@Co&#8208;NC battery achieves over 600 cycles at 1500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1; At &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, it reaches 650 cycles at 500&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. The research overcomes the cycle stability barrier in high&#8208;current Li&#8208;Cl2 batteries and offers a strategy for batteries with a wide temperature range and long cycle life.

         <title>Infrared In&#8208;Sensor Computing Based on Flexible Photothermoelectric Tellurium Nanomesh Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An infrared&#8208;sensitive image sensor based on self&#8208;welded tellurium (Te) nanomesh is proposed, demonstrating advancements in flexible integration and scalable fabrication. By leveraging the unique photothermolelectric (PTE) operation, thermal&#8208;coupled bi&#8208;directional photoresponse is explored to illustrate the proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in&#8208;sensor convolutional network for edge computing.








Abstract
The inherent limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures hinder the rapid development of internet of things technologies. Beyond conventional, complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technologies, imaging sensors integrated with near&#8208; or in&#8208;sensor computing architectures emerge as a promising solution. In this study, the multi&#8208;scale van der Waals (vdWs) interactions in 1D tellurium (Te) atomic chains are explored, leading to the deposition of a photothermoelectric (PTE) Te nanomesh on a polymeric polyimide substrate. The self&#8208;welding process enables the lateral vapor growth of a well&#8208;connected Te nanomesh with robust electrical and mechanical properties, including a PTE responsivity of &#8776;120&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 in the infrared light regime. Leveraging the PTE operation, the thermal&#8208;coupled bi&#8208;directional photoresponse is investigated to demonstrate a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle in&#8208;sensor convolutional network for edge computing. This work presents a scalable approach for assembling functional vdWs Te nanomesh and highlights its potential applications in PTE image sensing and convolutional processing.

         <title>Unveiling the Origin of Oxygen Framework Stability in Ultra&#8208;High Nickel Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The origin of oxygen framework stability is studied by integrating high covalent element Mo into the bulk and surface of ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode materials through a one&#8208;step method. Mo with strong covalency can suppress Li/Ni antisite defects and reduce Li&#8208;O&#8208;Li configurations, thus suppressing irreversible phase transition and stabilizing the oxygen framework structure at high voltage.








Abstract
Ultra&#8208;high nickel layered oxides are recognized as promising cathode candidates for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to their enhanced overall capacity and elevated operating voltage. However, the interlayer sliding of transition metal&#8208;oxygen octahedra (TMO6) and the instability of lattice oxygen at high voltages for ultra&#8208;high nickel oxide cathodes pose significant challenges to their development. Herein, the origin of oxygen framework stability is investigated by incorporating high&#8208;covalent element Mo in both bulk and surface using a one&#8208;step integrated method for ultra&#8208;high nickel cathode material LiNi0.92Co0.08O2. It is revealed that apart from the isolation and protection effect of the Mo&#8208;enriched surface layer, the suppression of Li/Ni antisite defects by Mo6+ with strong covalency in the bulk plays a critical role in reducing the configurations of the activated anionic redox reaction and stabilizing the lattice oxygen and oxygen framework structure. Benefiting from this, the reversibility of anionic redox reaction and the stability of oxygen framework is significantly enhanced, enabling more oxidized oxygen to exist in the form of oxygen dimer ions O2n&#8722;$O_2^{n - }$ rather than being lost as gaseous O2. Consequently, the modified ultra&#8208;high nickel material demonstrates improved diffusion kinetics and optimized electrochemical performance at high voltage.

         <title>Surface Engineering Enabling Efficient Upcycling of Highly Degraded Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acid etching assisted direct upcycling strategy that selectively removals rock&#8208;salt phases on the surface of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and dissociating polycrystalline structure to single crystals simultaneously, facilitating direct repair of its composition and structure via simple solid&#8208;state sintering. The regenerated LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 exhibits comparable capacity and more excellent electrochemical stability to commercialized ones.








Abstract
Direct recycling of cathode materials has attracted phenomenal attention due to its economic and eco&#8208;friendly advantages. However, existing direct recycling technologies are difficult to apply to highly degraded layered materials as the accumulation of thick rock&#8208;salt phases on their surfaces not only blocks lithiation channels but also is thermodynamically difficult to transform into layered phases. Here, a surface engineering&#8208;assisted direct upcycling strategy that reactivates the lithium diffusion channels at the highly degraded cathode surfaces using acid etching explored. Acid can selectively remove the electrochemically inert rock&#8208;salt phases on the surface while simultaneously dissociating the degraded polycrystalline structure to single crystals, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier of the relithiation process and enhancing the stability of the regenerated cathode. This strategy can restore the capacity of highly degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 from 59.7 to 165.4 mAh g&#8722;1, comparable to that of commercialized ones.

&lt;p&gt;Acid etching assisted direct upcycling strategy that selectively removals rock-salt phases on the surface of highly degraded LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dissociating polycrystalline structure to single crystals simultaneously, facilitating direct repair of its composition and structure via simple solid-state sintering. The regenerated LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits comparable capacity and more excellent electrochemical stability to commercialized ones.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct recycling of cathode materials has attracted phenomenal attention due to its economic and eco-friendly advantages. However, existing direct recycling technologies are difficult to apply to highly degraded layered materials as the accumulation of thick rock-salt phases on their surfaces not only blocks lithiation channels but also is thermodynamically difficult to transform into layered phases. Here, a surface engineering-assisted direct upcycling strategy that reactivates the lithium diffusion channels at the highly degraded cathode surfaces using acid etching explored. Acid can selectively remove the electrochemically inert rock-salt phases on the surface while simultaneously dissociating the degraded polycrystalline structure to single crystals, thereby reducing the thermodynamic barrier of the relithiation process and enhancing the stability of the regenerated cathode. This strategy can restore the capacity of highly degraded LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from 59.7 to 165.4 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to that of commercialized ones. The regenerated cathode also exhibits excellent electrochemical stability with a capacity retention of 80.1% at 1 C after 500 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2 V (vs graphite) in pouch-type full cells. In addition, the generality of this strategy has also been validated on Ni-rich layered materials and LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work presents a promising approach for direct recycling of highly degraded cathode materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Towards Stable Metal&#8211;I2 Battery: Design of Iodine&#8211;Containing Functional Groups for Enhanced Halogen Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A halogen bond (XB)&#8208;enhanced strategy is proposed, where &#9472;B(OH)I3 groups are incorporated into a highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF&#8211;BIn) to extend interactions between &#9472;B(OH)I3 and subsequent I2 molecules. The strong intermolecular forces in HOCF&#8211;BIn cathodes significantly enhance I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; confinement, enabling exceptional cycling stability at I2 loadings of 1.8&#8211;6.2 mg cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The redox chemistries of iodine have attracted tremendous attention for charge storage owing to their high theoretical specific capacity and natural abundance. However, the practical capacity and cycle life are greatly limited by the active mass loss originating from the dissolved iodine species in either non&#8208;aqueous or aqueous batteries. Despite intensive progress in physical and physicochemical confinements of iodine species (I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722;), less attention has been paid to confining iodine species beyond the host&#8211;iodine interface, inhibiting further development of iodine cathodes with high I2 contents. Here a halogen bond (XB)&#8211; enhanced design concept is proposed between I2 molecules to achieve stable cycling performances, as exemplified by the Na&#8211;I2 battery. The enhanced XB is derived from the incorporation of &#8211;B(OH)I3 groups in highly integrated porous carbon/I2 cathode (HOCF&#8211;BIn), which can generate extended interactions between &#8211;B(OH)I3 and following I2 molecules. Due to the strong intermolecular force between I2 molecules, the HOCF&#8211;BIn cathodes exhibit substantially strengthened I2/I3&#8722;/I&#8722; confinement, enabling outstanding cycling stability at I2 loading ranging from 1.8 to 6.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This findings demonstrate a functional group to manipulate XB chemistry within I2 molecules and polyiodides for stable and low&#8208;cost metal&#8211;iodine batteries.

         <title>Hydration Induces Dehydration: Creating Negative Swelling Gel by a Paradox</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative swelling of hydrogel is achieved via a paradoxical hydration&#8208;induced&#8208;dehydration pathway. Chemically crosslinked polymer network generates considerable hydrostatic pressure upon swelling, which forces transformable polymers to self&#8208;assemble and collapse. The as&#8208;fabricated gels can lose 35% weight underwater and exhibit water&#8208;strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn&#8208;off effect, which significantly broadened potential applications.









Abstract
Swelling positively in water is a common behavior of hydrogels, which, however, can lead to reduced mechanical performance and stability. Enabling negative swelling represents a promising way to address those issues but is extremely challenging to realize. Here, real negative swelling hydrogels are successfully prepared for the first time through a unique molecular architecture. Specifically designed interpenetrating transformable&#8208;rigid polymer network undergoes self&#8208;assembly and collapses upon hydration, which in turn dehydrates itself. This paradoxical hydration&#8208;induced&#8208;dehydration process brings about revolutionary outcomes. Gels can now lose up to 35% weight underwater and exhibit water&#8208;strengthened mechanical properties, enhanced structural responsiveness, underwater repair ability, resistance to deformation, and swelling turn&#8208;off effect. Those unique properties allow future material development and applications to be carried out in much broader dimensions.

         <title>Transparent and Conductive Polyimide&#8208;Ionene Hybrid Interlayers for High Performance and Cost&#8208;Effective Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel polyimide&#8208;ionene hybrids that exhibit desirable alcohol processability, conductivity, transparency, and metal/semiconductor interface modification ability are furnished by melding pyromellitic diimides into ionene backbones. These merits render them universal cathode interlayer materials with outstanding thickness tolerance, leading to not only highly efficient and stable opaque devices but also high&#8208;performance semitransparent devices even when pairing with low&#8208;cost Cu electrodes.








Abstract
The contradiction between high transmittance and favorable conductivity poses a great challenge in developing effective cathode interlayer (CIL) materials with sufficient thickness tolerance, which hinders the further advancement of organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a completely new class of alcohol processable polyimide&#8208;ionene hybrids (PIIHs) is proposed by melding pyromellitic diimide (PMD) subunits into imidazolium&#8208;based ionenes backbone covalently. These PIIHs, named PMD&#8208;DI and PMD&#8208;PD, boast high transparency, suitable energy levels, and decent conductivity. A higher PMD content endows PMD&#8208;PD with improved work function tunability, electrical properties, and crystallinity, enabling PMD&#8208;PD as CIL material with excellent thickness&#8208;insensitive characteristics, while simultaneously improving device stability significantly. Furthermore, PMD&#8208;PD also exhibits good compatibility with various electrodes and active layers, offering solar cell efficiencies of up to 19.91% and 19.29% with Ag and Cu cathodes, respectively. More importantly, the application of PMD&#8208;PD can improve the performance of semi&#8208;transparent OSCs without losing transmittance, thereby drastically enhancing the light utilization efficiency to 4.04% with an ultrathin, low&#8208;cost Cu cathode, that competes with leading optical modulation&#8208;free semitransparent OSCs with expensive Ag cathodes. This work opens a pathway to realize transparent and conductive interlayers by strategic molecular design, leading to highly efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective OSCs suitable for diverse applications.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Photomultiplication and Photovoltaic Dual&#8208;Mode Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor, BFDO&#8208;4F, is integrated into organic photodetectors (OPDs) to enable electron trapping. The resulting devices exhibit dual&#8208;mode functionality, with bias&#8208;switchable operation between photovoltaic (PV) and photomultiplication (PM) modes. An on&#8208;chip module is demonstrated, where the PV section supplies bias for the PM section achieving self&#8208;powered amplifier&#8208;free system, highlighting the potential for multifunctional OPDs in advanced optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodetectors (PM&#8208;OPDs) provide for signal amplification, ideal for detecting faint light, and simplifying detection systems. However, current designs often suffer from slow response speed and elevated dark current. Conversely, photovoltaic&#8208;type organic photodetectors (PV&#8208;OPDs) provide fast response and high specific detectivity (D*) but have limited photoresponse.

&lt;p&gt;A novel non-fullerene acceptor, BFDO-4F, is integrated into organic photodetectors (OPDs) to enable electron trapping. The resulting devices exhibit dual-mode functionality, with bias-switchable operation between photovoltaic (PV) and photomultiplication (PM) modes. An on-chip module is demonstrated, where the PV section supplies bias for the PM section achieving self-powered amplifier-free system, highlighting the potential for multifunctional OPDs in advanced optoelectronic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photomultiplication-type organic photodetectors (PM-OPDs) provide for signal amplification, ideal for detecting faint light, and simplifying detection systems. However, current designs often suffer from slow response speed and elevated dark current. Conversely, photovoltaic-type organic photodetectors (PV-OPDs) provide fast response and high specific detectivity (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) but have limited photoresponse. This study presents the synthesis and incorporation of a non-fullerene acceptor, BFDO-4F, into the active layer to introduce trap states for capturing photogenerated electrons. The resulting device exhibits dual-mode characteristic and is bias-switchable between PV and PM-modes. In PV-mode, the OPDs achieve high &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Covalent Anchoring of Mechanical Polymer for Highly Stable Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable Zn interfacial architecture is established, where a robust polyimide nanofilm is covalently anchored to the Zn substrate through electronegative F atoms. The strong covalent interactions provide excellent interfacial adhesion during repeated Zn/Zn2+ cycling. The remarkable resilience, modulus, and low creep of FPI film effectively resist the impact stress from electroplated Zn while maintaining structural integrity.








Abstract
Artificial interfacial protective coatings (IPCs) on Zn anodes provide a viable solution for suppressing dendritic growth by spatially confining and homogenizing the Zn2+ flux. However, repeated Zn deformation during electroplating/stripping cycles can lead to the rupture or exfoliation of IPCs, as well as the formation of detrimental interfacial gaps. Herein, a highly durable IPC is developed on a Zn substrate using a mechanically robust fluorinated polyimide nanofilm (FPI). This unique FPI interphase forms strong covalent bonds with Zn through electronegative fluorine atoms, facilitating Zn plating/stripping while maintaining interfacial adhesion. The superior resilience, modulus, and low creep of the FPI film resist the impact stresses from electroplated Zn, ensuring structural integrity. With this FPI coating, the FPI&#8208;Cu||Zn half cells demonstrate high reversibility in Zn2+ electroplating/stripping over 4000 h, maintaining Coulombic efficiency above 99.33%. When coupled with a MnO2 cathode, the MnO2||FPI&#8208;Zn full cells exhibit a long lifespan, surpassing 5000 cycles, with a high specific capacity retention of 75.21%. This study highlights the importance of achieving a balance between the customized compatibility and mechanical properties of IPCs to modulate zinc interfacial chemistries.

         <title>Localized Electrolyte Grain Engineering to Suppress Li Intrusion in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a highly scalable chemical approach based on the anion exchange reaction is developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite&#8208;type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion.








Abstract
Li intrusion is the primary factor contributing to the undesirable cycling durability and rate capability of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. However, conventional engineering methodologies for solid electrolytes (SEs) that focus on crystalline scales, such as doping, have limited efficacy in addressing this issue, as they not only involve cumbersome trial&#8208;and&#8208;error processes but also struggle to simultaneously optimize the multiple macroscopic properties necessary for effectively suppressing Li intrusion. Herein, rather than following the conventional practice of SE engineering, it is concentrated on optimizing SEs at the grain&#8208;aggregate level. A highly scalable chemical approach based on a thermodynamic&#8208;favored anion exchange reaction is first developed to engineer an amorphous metal compound layer on the surface of argyrodite&#8208;type electrolyte grains. Further, a novel localized grain engineering concept is introduced, which combines engineered and pure electrolyte grains to enable aggregates with favorable macroscopic properties for suppressing Li intrusion. The localized grain&#8208;engineered electrolyte aggregates greatly enhance Li reversibility and are able to suppress Li intrusion under practical working conditions. Notably, the 20 &#181;m&#8208;Li||LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 cell using localized grain&#8208;engineered electrolyte aggregates can stably cycle for over 2000 cycles at a high current density of 1.6 mA cm&#8722;2.

Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AAIBs) offer a promising avenue for achieving safe, high&#8208;energy, and low&#8208;cost large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, the practical development of AAIBs is hindered by competitive reduction reactions in the aqueous solution, which lead to insufficient aluminum (Al) deposition and a severe hydrogen evolution reaction (HRE). In this work, an inorganic/organic hybrid hydrogel with a stable silicon&#8208;based network and multiple polar sites is successfully fabricated via an in situ sol&#8208;gel polymerization method. The preferential formation of hydrogen bonds between the polar functional groups and water molecules effectively reduces the thermodynamic reactivity of water. Furthermore, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF&#8208;SIMS) analyses confirm the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer, which kinetically suppresses undesirable side reactions. This hydrogel electrolyte exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 2.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, even under lean&#8208;water conditions. As a result, Al|hydrogel|potassium nickel hexacyanoferrate (KNHCF) full cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, delivering a high initial discharge capacity of 74.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 mA g&#8722;1 and achieving an outstanding capacity retention of 90.0% after 200 cycles. Additionally, pouch cells exhibit stable open&#8208;circuit voltage under various mechanical abuse conditions.

         <title>Machine Learning Relationships Between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study constructs a unified supercapacitor database comprising hundreds of MOF electrodes based on constant&#8208;potential molecular simulation. The relationships between porous structures and electrochemical performance are thoroughly examined through interpretable machine learning techniques, with molecular insights by analyzing in&#8208;pore electrode&#8208;ion coordination and ion diffusion. These findings pave the way for the design and optimization of advanced electrode materials.









Abstract
The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, constant&#8208;potential molecular simulation is used to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well&#8208;trained decision&#8208;tree&#8208;based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode&#8208;ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D&#8208;pore and 3D&#8208;pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D&#8208;pore and 3D&#8208;pore MOFs. Especially for 3D&#8208;pore MOFs, an exponential increase in porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in&#8208;pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing.

     alt="Machine Learning Relationships Between Nanoporous Structures and Electrochemical Performance in MOF Supercapacitors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study constructs a unified supercapacitor database comprising hundreds of MOF electrodes based on constant-potential molecular simulation. The relationships between porous structures and electrochemical performance are thoroughly examined through interpretable machine learning techniques, with molecular insights by analyzing in-pore electrode-ion coordination and ion diffusion. These findings pave the way for the design and optimization of advanced electrode materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of supercapacitors is impeded by the unclear relationships between nanoporous electrode structures and electrochemical performance, primarily due to challenges in decoupling the complex interdependencies of various structural descriptors. While machine learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution, their application is hindered by the lack of large, unified databases. Herein, constant-potential molecular simulation is used to construct a unified supercapacitor database with hundreds of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) electrodes. Leveraging this database, well-trained decision-tree-based ML models achieve fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions of capacitance and charging rate, experimentally validated by a representative case. SHAP analyses reveal that specific surface area (SSA) governs gravimetric capacitance while pore size effects are minimal, attributed to the strong dependence of electrode-ion coordination on SSA rather than pore size. SSA and porosity, respectively, dominate volumetric capacitance in 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs, pinnacling the indispensable effects of pore dimensionality. Meanwhile, porosity is found to be the most decisive factor in the charging rate for both 1D-pore and 3D-pore MOFs. Especially for 3D-pore MOFs, an exponential increase in porosity is observed in both ionic conductance and in-pore ion diffusion coefficient, ascribed to loosened ion packing. These findings provide profound insights for the design of high-performance supercapacitor electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Meter&#8208;scale MXene/GO@monstera nanocellulose core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles are produced, integrating ultra&#8208;broadband EMI shielding covering GHz and THz bands, super&#8208;strong stealth properties within NIR and MIR ranges, and excellent multifunctionality, including heat resistance, flame retardant, joule heating, and stress sensing capabilities, which are promising for comprehensive electromagnetic defense in both military and civilian fields.








Abstract
The rapid development of wireless communication and infrared (IR) detection technologies has generated an increasing demand for large&#8208;size high&#8208;performance wearable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and IR stealth textiles. Herein, meter&#8208;scale MXene/graphene oxide (MG)@monstera nanocellulose (MC) core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles are fabricated for the first time using a multi&#8208;stage cryogenic drying&#8208;assisted coaxial wet spinning assembly strategy, with MG as the conductive composite core and MC as the organic skeleton shell. The highly aligned shell and dense core endow the nanofibers with a great toughness of &#8776;39.6&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, a strong strength &gt;&#8776;180&#160;MPa, and a high conductivity of 6.4 &#215; 103 S&#160;m&#8722;1. The textiles exhibit unprecedented ultra&#8208;broadband EMI shielding performance covering gigahertz and terahertz bands, with optimal shielding effectiveness up to 84 and 85&#160;dB in the band of 8.2&#8211;26.5&#160;GHz and 0.3&#8211;1.5 THz, respectively, at only 185&#160;&#181;m thick. Superb IR stealth performance in the near&#8208; and mid&#8208;IR ranges is also achieved, benefitting from their good heat resistance and low IR emissivity. Furthermore, the textiles also demonstrate excellent dyeability, flame retardancy, Joule heating, and stress&#8208;sensing properties. Such scalable prepared core&#8208;shell nanofiber textiles with superior comprehensive performance have broad application prospects in future smart wearable protective devices.

         <title>Advancing Beyond 800 Nm: Highly Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Thermally Activated Delayed Lasing Triggered by Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A D&#8211;A&#8211;D type TADF molecule, TPA&#8208;DHAQ, is designed and synthesized by introducing an ESIPT&#8208;active molecule DHAQ as the acceptor unit, based on which the NIR TADF laser with a low threshold and high stability is successfully realized. In addition, a single&#8208;mode NIR TADF laser can be realized by adjusting the size of the resonator. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy to overcome the problem of poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers.









Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) organic lasers have undergone rapid development in recent years, but still facing challenges in lowering the threshold and improving the stability. Herein, to overcome these challenges, a &#8220;two in one&#8221; strategy involving the integration of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) activity in a single molecule is proposed. Specifically, a donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor type TADF material 2,6&#8208;bis[4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl]&#8208;1,5&#8208;dihydroxyanthraquinone (TPA&#8208;DHAQ) with an ESIPT&#8208;active moiety as the acceptor, is designed and synthesized, based on which, a NIR organic laser at 820&#160;nm with an exceptionally low threshold of 6.3&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 can be realized. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of the TADF property and the ESIPT process, the resulting organic laser showed excellent stability by maintaining the laser intensity at &#8776;80% of the initial value after 580 min of continuous excitation. Finally, by modulating the size of the resonator, a single&#8208;mode NIR laser is successfully realized. This work provides a novel molecular design strategy for the development of new TADF gain materials to overcome the problem of high threshold and poor stability of conventional NIR organic lasers, and shed light on the future development of NIR organic lasers.

         <title>Recreating Silk's Fibrillar Nanostructure by Spinning Solubilized, Undegummed Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolving Undegummed silk leads to a solution with undegraded silk that exhibits liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). Spinning the solution leads to fibers with a &#8776;20&#160;nm nanofibrillar hierarchy that are 2.3 times tougher than natural silk fibers. This establishes the importance of retaining molecular weight, presence of sericins, and priming LLPS in designing tougher&#8208;than&#8208;nature fibers with fibrillar hierarchy.








Abstract
The remarkable toughness (&gt;70&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) of silkworm silk is largely attributed to its hierarchically arranged nanofibrillar nanostructure. Recreating such tough fibers through artificial spinning is often challenging, in part because degummed, dissolved silk is drastically different to the unspun native feedstock found in the spinning gland. The present work demonstrates a method to dissolve silk without degumming to produce a solution containing undegraded fibroin and sericin. This solution exhibits liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation above 10% (wt/wt), a behavior observed in the silk gland but not in degummed silk solutions to date. This partitioning enhances the stability of the undegummed solution, delaying gelation two&#8208;fold compared with degummed silk at the same concentration. When spun under identical conditions, undegummed solutions produces fibers 8&#215; stronger and 218&#215; tougher than degummed silk feedstocks. Through ultrasonication, undegummed wet spun fibers are seen to possess hierarchical structure of densely packed &#8776;20&#160;nm nanofibrils, similar to native silks, although completely absent from fibers wet&#8208;spun from degummed silk solutions. This work demonstrates that the preservation of molecular weight, presence of sericin and stimulation of liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation underpin a new pathway to recreate a hierarchical fiber with structures akin to native silk.

         <title>Hybrid Soft Segments Boost the Development of Ultratough Thermoplastic Elastomers with Tunable Hardness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hardness of a polymer material greatly affects its applicability, but traditionally, increasing hardness tends to reduce toughness. This study introduces a hybrid soft segment strategy that effectively regulates the hardness of thermoplastic elastomers without compromising their inherent toughness, enhancing their safety and structural integrity for broader applications.








Abstract
The hardness of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) significantly influences their suitability for various applications, but traditionally, enhancing hardness reduces toughness. Herein a method is introduced that leverages hybrid soft segments to fine&#8208;tune the hardness of TPEs without compromising their exceptional toughness. Through the selective copolymerization of polytetramethylene ether glycols (PTMEGs) at various molecular weights, supramolecular poly(urethane&#8208;urea) TPEs are molecularly engineered to cover a wide spectrum of hardness while retaining good toughness. It is achieved through the formation of graded functional zones&#8212;densely packed for enhanced hardness and strength, and loosely packed for greater extensibility and toughness&#8212;driven by variations in PTMEG chain length and mismatched supramolecular interactions. Through the establishment and systematic investigation of a TPE library, the intricate interplay between design, structure, and performance of these materials is elucidated, refining the optimization techniques. The TPEs demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a variant with a Shore hardness of 86A and a toughness of 819&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, alongside a softer variant with a 59A hardness and a 786&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 toughness. The innovation extends to a scalable solvent&#8208;based TPE production line, promising widespread industrial application. This advancement reimagines the potential of high&#8208;performance TPEs and composites, offering versatile materials for demanding applications.

&lt;p&gt;The hardness of thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) significantly influences their suitability for various applications, but traditionally, enhancing hardness reduces toughness. Herein a method is introduced that leverages hybrid soft segments to fine-tune the hardness of TPEs without compromising their exceptional toughness. Through the selective copolymerization of polytetramethylene ether glycols (PTMEGs) at various molecular weights, supramolecular poly(urethane-urea) TPEs are molecularly engineered to cover a wide spectrum of hardness while retaining good toughness. It is achieved through the formation of graded functional zones&#8212;densely packed for enhanced hardness and strength, and loosely packed for greater extensibility and toughness&#8212;driven by variations in PTMEG chain length and mismatched supramolecular interactions. Through the establishment and systematic investigation of a TPE library, the intricate interplay between design, structure, and performance of these materials is elucidated, refining the optimization techniques. The TPEs demonstrate exceptional mechanical properties, including a variant with a Shore hardness of 86A and a toughness of 819&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, alongside a softer variant with a 59A hardness and a 786&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; toughness. The innovation extends to a scalable solvent-based TPE production line, promising widespread industrial application. This advancement reimagines the potential of high-performance TPEs and composites, offering versatile materials for demanding applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Template Realizing Oriented Perovskites for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface quasi&#8208;2D template is introduced in the two&#8208;step fabrication technology to induce an ordered crystallization, enhancing photovoltaic device stability and efficiency. This resulted in 25.79% power conversion efficiency and a 1.188V open&#8208;circuit voltage, retaining 90.38% efficiency after 500 h.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films, ensuring optically active phase purity with uniform crystal orientation, are ideal for photovoltaic applications. However, the optically active &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 phase is easy to degrade into &#948;&#8208;phase due to numerous defects within randomly oriented films. Here, a &#8220;quasi&#8208;2D&#8221; perovskite template is pre&#8208;deposited on the film surface within the crystallization process based on the two&#8208;step preparation technology, which directly induced pure and highly orientated crystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 across the downward growth process. Furthermore, the enlarged interaction between 2D components with colloidal properties and lead iodide delayed the crystallization process effectively, yielding high crystallinity with low trap state density. The resulting perovskite photovoltaic devices exhibited a champion efficiency as high as 25.79% with comprehensively improved device stability. This work provides new insights into the utilization of 2D components and the formation mechanism behind 2D perovskites.

         <title>A Library of Polyphenol&#8208;Amino Acid Condensates for High&#8208;Throughput Continuous Flow Production of Nanomedicines with Ultra&#8208;High Drug Loading</title>

         <dc:description>
A scalable and flexible library of natural, renewable tea polyphenol, and amino acid condensate colloidal spheres, synthesized via a one&#8208;step process, facilitates the preparation of ultra&#8208;high drug&#8208;loading nanomedicines with precise size control and uniform dispersion using continuous&#8208;flow microfluidics. This approach effectively addresses the challenges associated with the nanonization of poorly soluble drugs and holds significant promise for advancing pharmaceutical formulations.









Abstract
Synthesizing high drug&#8208;loading nanomedicines remains a formidable challenge, and achieving universally applicable, continuous, large&#8208;scale engineered production of such nanomedicines presents even greater difficulties. This study presents a scalable library of polyphenol&#8208;amino acid condensates. By selecting amino acids, the library enables precise customization of key properties, such as carrier capacity, bioactivity, and other critical attributes, offering a versatile range of options for various application scenarios. Leveraging the properties of solvent&#8208;mediated disassembly and reassembly of condensates achieved an ultra&#8208;high drug loading of 86% for paclitaxel. For a range of poorly soluble molecules, the drug loading capacity exceeded 50%, indicating broad applicability. Furthermore, employing a continuous microfluidic device, the production rate can reach 5 mL&#160;min&#8722;1 (36 g&#160;per day), with the nanoparticle size precisely tunable and a polydispersity index (PDI) below 0.2. The polyphenol&#8208;based carrier demonstrates efficient cellular uptake and, in three distinct animal models, has been shown to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel without significant side effects. This study presents a streamlined, efficient, and scalable approach using microfluidics to produce nanomedicines with ultra&#8208;high drug loading, offering a promising strategy for the nanoformulation of poorly soluble drugs.

         <title>Folding of mRNA&#8208;DNA Origami for Controlled Translation and Viral Vector Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The packaging of mRNA into a compact, predefined shape can impact cellular delivery. This study presents a first set of design rules for the efficient folding of mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures, while preserving its initial translation functionality, which is demonstrated extracellularly as well as in vitro by using virus capsid proteins for packaging and enhancing cellular uptake.








Abstract
mRNA is an important molecule in vaccine development and treatment of genetic disorders. Its capability to hybridize with DNA oligonucleotides in a programmable manner facilitates the formation of RNA&#8208;DNA origami structures, which can possess a well&#8208;defined morphology and serve as rigid supports for mRNA delivery. However, to date, comprehensive studies on the requirements for efficient folding of mRNA into distinct mRNA&#8208;DNA structures while preserving its translation functionality remain elusive. Here, the impact of design parameters on the folding of protein&#8208;encoding mRNA into mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures is systematically investigated and the importance of the availability of ribosome&#8208;binding sequences on the translation efficiency is demonstrated. Furthermore, these hybrid structures are encapsulated inside virus capsids resulting in protecting them against nuclease degradation and also in enhancement of their cellular uptake. This multicomponent system therefore showcases a modular and versatile nanocarrier. The work provides valuable insight into the design of mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures contributing to the development of mRNA&#8208;based gene delivery platforms.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Ceria Nanozyme Reinforced Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Treatments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an effective strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;catalytic and stable nanozymes, and introduces the first example of amyloid&#8208;ceria nanozymes reinforced microneedle which features a complex, synergistic catalytic behavior combining superoxide dismutase and catalase&#8208;like activities, promoting to remodel the infection microenvironment in diabetic wounds, and holding significant promise for clinical applications.








Abstract
Amyloid fibrils have emerged as excellent templates and building blocks for the development of ordered functional materials with considerable potential in biomedical applications. Here, lysozyme amyloid fibrils (Lys&#8208;AFs) are employed as templates for the in situ synthesis of ceria nanozymes (Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria) with ultrafine dimensions, an optimized Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, and uniform distribution on the fibril surface, addressing the challenges of low catalytic efficiency and high susceptibility to aggregation typical of traditional methods. As a proof of concept, it is further applied Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria to develop hydrogel/microneedle for treating bacteria&#8208;infected diabetic wounds via non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyphenols and amyloid fibrils incorporating glucose oxidase (GOX). The hydrogel/microneedle facilitates superoxide dismutase and catalase cascade catalysis by Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria, and integrates GOX&#8208;mediated glucose consumption, synergistically achieving glucose reduction, reactive oxygen species elimination, and hypoxia alleviation in the diabetic wound infection microenvironment. In addition to antibacterial properties and tissue regeneration promotion of Lys&#8208;AFs scaffold, Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria regulates macrophages polarization toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 state. Collectively, these attributes contribute to the enhanced efficacy of diabetic wound healing, with in vivo studies demonstrating increased healing efficiency following a single application, and more in general an effective strategy toward high&#8208;catalytic and stable nanozymes.

         <title>Nanopore&#8208;Functionalized Hybrid Lipid&#8208;Block Copolymer Membranes Allow Efficient Single&#8208;Molecule Sampling and Stable Sensing of Human Serum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological nanopores are highly promising tools for single&#8208;molecule biosensors, but the fragile supporting lipid membranes is a major bottleneck. An alternative hybrid membrane is presented, comprising phospholipids and block co&#8208;polymers, that can be functionalized by a broad variety of nanopores for single&#8208;molecule sensing. Crucially, the hybrid membrane provides substantially increased stability to harsh conditions, providing new opportunities for nanopore&#8208;based biosensors.








Abstract
Biological nanopores are powerful tools for single&#8208;molecule detection, with promising potential as next&#8208;generation biosensors. A major bottleneck in nanopore analysis is the fragility of the supporting lipid membranes, that easily rupture after exposure to biological samples. Membranes comprising PMOXA&#8208;PDMS&#8208;PMOXA (poly(2&#8208;methyloxazoline&#8208;b&#8208;dimethylsiloxane&#8208;b&#8208;2&#8208;methyloxazoline)) or PBD&#8208;PEO (poly(1,2&#8208;butadiene)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(ethylene oxide)) polymers may form robust alternatives, but their suitability for the reconstitution of a broad range of nanopores has not yet been investigated. Here, PBD&#8208;PEO membranes are found to be highly robust toward applied voltages and human serum, while providing a poor environment for nanopore reconstitution. However, hybrid membranes containing a similar molar ratio of PBD11PEO8 polymers and diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPhPC) lipids show the best of both worlds: highly robust membranes suitable for the reconstitution of a wide variety of nanopores. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that lipids form &#8776;12&#160;nm domains interspersed by a polymer matrix. Nanopores partition into these lipid nanodomains and sequester lipids, possibly offering the same binding strength as in a native bilayer. Nanopores reconstituted in hybrid membranes yield efficient sampling of biomolecules and enable sensing of high concentrations of human serum. This work thus shows that hybrid membranes functionalized with nanopores allow single&#8208;molecule sensing, while forming robust interfaces, resolving an important bottleneck for novel nanopore&#8208;based biosensors.

         <title>Elimination of Concentration Polarization Under Ultra&#8208;High Current Density Zinc Deposition by Nanofluid Self&#8208;Driven Ion Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc anodes face severe instability under extreme conditions of high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge (DOD) due to severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalance between Zn2&#8314; consumption and transfer rates. To overcome this, a nanofluid layer is introduced to rapidly absorb Zn2&#8314; and regulate interfacial ion transport, effectively mitigating polarization and enabling stable zinc deposition. This work provides key insights into interfacial engineering for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The commercialization of zinc metal batteries aims at high&#8208;rate capability and lightweight, which requires zinc anodes working at high current density, high areal capacity, and high depth of discharge. However, frequent zinc anode fades drastically under extreme conditions. Herein, it is revealed that the primary reason for the anode instability is the severe concentration polarization caused by the imbalanced consumption rate and transfer rate of Zn2+ under extreme conditions. Based on this finding, a nanofluid layer is constructed to rapidly absorb Zn2+ and mitigate the polarization induced by the nonlinear transport of interfacial ions. The modified zinc anode sustains at extreme conditions for over 1573 h (40 mA cm&#8722;2, 40 mAh cm&#8722;2, DOD = 75.97%) and 490 h (100 mA cm&#8722;2, 100 mAh cm&#8722;2, DOD = 90.91%), and achieving an unprecedented cumulative capacity of 62.92 Ah cm&#8722;2. This work offers both fundamental and practical insights for the interface design in energy storage devices.

         <title>Negative&#8208;Valent Platinum Stabilized by Pt&#9472;Ni Electron Bridges on Oxygen&#8208;Deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed Pt anchored in oxygen&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH via Pt&#9472;Ni bonds reduces Pt's valence state, enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction performance. Oxygen vacancies facilitate electron transfer, while elevated Ni valence boosts hydrophilicity and lowers hydrolysis barriers. The catalyst achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials and significantly higher mass activity compared to Pt/C, showcasing a novel coordination design strategy.








Abstract
The unique hydrogen adsorption characteristics of negatively charged platinum play a crucial role in enhancing the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. However, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are typically anchored to the support through non&#8208;metallic atom bonds, resulting in a high oxidation state. Here, atomically dispersed Pt atoms are anchored in oxygen&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH. Electron transfer between Pt and NiFe&#8208;LDH occurs primarily through Pt&#9472;Ni bonds rather than the conventional Pt&#9472;O bonds. Oxygen vacancies in the NiFe&#8208;LDH promote additional electron transfer from Ni to Pt, thereby reducing the valence state of Pt and enhancing hydrogen adsorption. Meanwhile, the elevated valence state of Ni increases the catalyst's hydrophilicity and reduces the energy barrier for hydrolysis dissociation. This catalyst demonstrates remarkably low overpotentials of 4 and 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH and 1&#160;m KPi, respectively. Additionally, its mass activity is 51.5 and 23.7 times higher that of Pt/C, respectively. This study presents a novel strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic performance through the rational design of coordination environments and electronic structures in supported metal catalysts.

         <title>Critical Ingredients Revitalize Magnesium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Rationality and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 15, April 16, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Critical ingredients can revitalize magnesium&#8208;metal anode in conventional electrolytes. Mechanistic insights, with an emphasis on Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure regulation, interfacial evolution, solvent ionization, and weak interfacial passivation, have been especially underscored in terms of the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly&#8208;passivated interphase properties.









Abstract
Multivalent&#8208;metal batteries hold tremendous promise in solving safety and sustainability problems encountered by common lithium&#8208;ion batteries, but the lack of ideal electrolyte solutions restricts their large&#8208;scale adoption. Tuning electrolyte structures with functional ingredients, especially amines/methoxy&#8208;based amines and phosphates, can revitalize multivalent&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes in conventional electrolytes, unlocking their full potential. However, a rational and clear understanding of the implications of these ingredients, notwithstanding critically important to commercially available electrolyte design, has not been widely accepted. This concise perspective aims to provide timely analysis and discussion on ingredients&#8217; functionalities of solvation shell speciation, interphase evolution, and consequently metal plating/stripping kinetics acceleration. In addition to prevailing coordination interactions, fresh understandings of intermolecular ionization/association and unique interphase formation are underscored by the close relationship between electrolyte chemistries and weakly passivated interphase properties. The existing understandings and proposed outlooks are expected to promote the next breakthroughs for rechargeable multivalent&#8208;metal batteries.

Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices
Machine Learning designs new nanolattice geometries with the strength of carbon steel, but the density of Styrofoam, offering record strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight of lightweight materials. By implementing multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization in combination with two&#8208;photon polymerization and pyrolysis, these ultrahigh specific strength carbon nanolattices more than double the performance of benchmark materials. More details can be found in article number 2410651 by Peter Serles, Tobin Filleter, Seunghwa Ryu, and co&#8208;workers.

True Random Number Generator
In article number 2419579, Hocheon Yoo and co&#8208;workers present arc discharge light&#8208;induced true random number generator (ALTRNG), using a bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector to generate random bits through unpredictable arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams and, with a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, enables wireless random number transmission for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.

CO2 Photoreduction
A novel family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers, which is capable of mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO2 photoreduction with only H2O vapor, has been developed through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine&#8208;type monomers and acetic anhydride for the first time, opening&#8208;up new possibilities in the development of new polymeric semiconductors for artificial photocatalysis. More details can be found in article number 2417437 by Xiaodong Li, Sheng Dai, and co&#8208;workers.

Bionic Polarization Vision
In article number 2415530, Xiujuan Zhang and co&#8208;workers report a photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor for bionic night&#8208;time polarization perception. Ultrahigh dichroic ratio of &gt;105 is achieved through time accumulation under ultraweak light of 200 nW cm&#8722;2. High&#8208;contrast polarization imaging is realized in artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization of 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles.

         <title>Ultrahigh Specific Strength by Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization algorithm designs high&#8208;strength nanolattices made of pyrolytic carbon which offer the compressive strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam. This study combines machine learning with nanoscale strengthening and nanoscale 3D printing to achieve unattained material properties with millimeter scalability for light&#8208;weight high&#8208;strength materials.








Abstract
Nanoarchitected materials are at the frontier of metamaterial design and have set the benchmark for mechanical performance in several contemporary applications. However, traditional nanoarchitected designs with conventional topologies exhibit poor stress distributions and induce premature nodal failure. Here, using multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization and two&#8208;photon polymerization, optimized carbon nanolattices with an exceptional specific strength of 2.03&#160;MPa&#160;m3&#160;kg&#8722;1 at low densities &lt;215&#160;kg m&#8722;3 are created. Generative design optimization provides experimental improvements in strength and Young's modulus by as much as 118% and 68%, respectively, at equivalent densities with entirely different lattice failure responses. Additionally, the reduction of nanolattice strut diameters to 300&#160;nm produces a unique high&#8208;strength carbon with a pyrolysis&#8208;induced atomic gradient of 94% sp2 aromatic carbon and low oxygen impurities. Using multi&#8208;focus multi&#8208;photon polymerization, a millimeter&#8208;scalable metamaterial consisting of 18.75 million lattice cells with nanometer dimensions is demonstrated. Combining Bayesian optimized designs and nanoarchitected pyrolyzed carbon, the optimal nanostructures exhibit the strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam offering unparalleled capabilities in light&#8208;weighting, fuel reduction, and contemporary design applications.

         <title>Engineered Neutrophil Nanovesicles for Inhibiting Corneal Neovascularization by Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammatory, Anti&#8208;VEGF, and Chemoexcited Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop for cornea neovascularization treatment has been developed. The nanovesicle inherits the chemotactic and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities of the neutrophils and acts as a drug carrier. By incorporating ranibizumab on its surface and loading photosensitizers into the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane, a synergistic and complementary treatment of cornea neovascularization is achieved by anti&#8208;inflammation, anti&#8208;VEGF, and PDT therapy.








Abstract
Corneal neovascularization (CorNV) develops under various pathological conditions and is one of the main causes of blindness. Due to that CorNV progression involves multiple steps, anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs alone could not sufficiently suppress this process, highlighting an urgent need for an efficient delivery system for the multi&#8208;step management of CorNV. In this study, a neutrophil nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop (NCCR) is developed for CorNV therapy that simultaneously inhibits angiogenesis and inflammation, while eliminating pathological cells through chemoexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT). NCCR targets inflammatory lesions by leveraging the expression of chemokine receptors from the source cells. Then, NCCR exerts inhibitory effects on the sequential steps of neovascularization. First, it acts as a decoy and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect by neutralizing cytokines via its receptors on the surface of nanovesicles. Second, thioketals bond&#8208;linked ranibizumab is released in the high reactive oxygen species microenvironment of CorNV sites to bind VEGF, inhibiting vascular endothelial cell activation and proliferation. Finally, chemoexcited PDT eliminates preformed corneal blood vessels, disrupting tube formation and pericyte recruitment. The synergistic effects of NCCR on angiogenesis and inflammation, combined with the induction of apoptosis in neovessels via chemoexcited PDT, offer a novel and efficient strategy for CorNV treatment.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Polarized Photoresponse in Organic Single&#8208;Crystal Phototransistors for Bionic Night&#8208;Time Polarization Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) based on highly anisotropic organic crystals is developed for bionic night&#8208;time polarization perception. Ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of &gt;105 is achieved through time accumulation under ultraweak light of 200 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2. High&#8208;contrast polarization imaging is realized in artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles.








Abstract
The emerging semiconductor micro/nanocrystals with intrinsic anisotropy have provided new perspectives for low&#8208;cost and simplified polarimetry. However, the low polarization sensitivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarimeters based on anisotropic semiconductors under weak and partially polarized light severely hinders their practical application in complex dim environments. Here, a photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) is demonstrated for bionic weak&#8208;light polarization perception. The combination of highly anisotropic organic crystals with charge&#8208;storage accumulative effect enables a self&#8208;adaptive polarized photoresponse of the phototransistor to imitate the bionic scotopic adaptation process. Consequently, an ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of over 105 is achieved through time accumulation under an ultraweak light intensity of 200 nW cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest in polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. Furthermore, POL&#8208;OPT array is constructed for effective polarization perception in an artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) down to 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles. This study offers a new opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance polarimeters for polarization imaging, bionic navigation, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Engineered Stem Cell Booster Breaks&#160;Pathological Barriers to Treat Chronic Pancreatitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), two main pathological barriers are encountered: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based nitric oxide system is constructed to regulate collagen fibers and enhance therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, showing the synergetic effect and successfully breaking two pathological barriers.








Abstract
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a long&#8208;standing progressive fibrosis and has long been considered incurable, which remains a heavy health burden worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with anti&#8208;fibrosis properties are currently used in the treatment of fibroinflammatory diseases. However, its therapeutic effect is limited mainly due to two main types of pathological barriers in CP: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based exogenous nitric oxide (NO) delivery system (MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO) is constructed. In the MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO, NO not only can be a cell booster to regulate collagen fibers, relieve the vascular compression and enhance the accumulation of MSCs in the whole pancreas, but also can form a protective gas layer on the cell surface, which enhances the therapeutic effect of MSCs. In the CP rat model, the pancreatic injury and fibrosis are reduced with 7 days after a single dose administration of this long&#8208;acting MSCs. Collectively, this study offers a promising strategy for enhancing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs to break pathological barriers in CP treatment.

Here, a MSCs-based exogenous nitric oxide (NO) delivery system (MSCs-Lip@RNO) is constructed. In the MSCs-Lip@RNO, NO not only can be a cell booster to regulate collagen fibers, relieve the vascular compression and enhance the accumulation of MSCs in the whole pancreas, but also can form a protective gas layer on the cell surface, which enhances the therapeutic effect of MSCs. In the CP rat model, the pancreatic injury and fibrosis are reduced with 7 days after a single dose administration of this long-acting MSCs. Collectively, this study offers a promising strategy for enhancing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs to break pathological barriers in CP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep Learning Analysis of Localized Interlayer Stacking Displacement and Dynamics in Bilayer Phosphorene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer displacement plays a crucial role in tuning properties of layered crystals, yet its precise and efficient determination remains challenging. A deep learning&#8208;based analysis is presented for atomic&#8208;resolution phase&#8208;contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, accurately identifying stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene with near unit&#8208;cell resolution. The model processes large&#8208;scale in situ TEM data, capturing time&#8208;dependent displacement dynamics linked to edge reconstruction.








Abstract
The interlayer displacement has recently emerged as a crucial tuning parameter to control diverse physical properties in layered crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an exceptionally powerful tool for structural analysis, directly observes the interlayer stacking and strain fields in various crystals. However, conventional analysis methods based on high&#8208;resolution phase&#8208;contrast TEM images are inadequate for recognizing spatially varying unit&#8208;cell patterns and their associated structure factors, hindering precise determination of interlayer displacements. Here, a deep learning&#8208;based analysis is introduced for atomic resolution TEM images, enabling unit&#8208;cell pattern recognition and precise identification of interlayer stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene. The deep learning model applied to bilayer phosphorene accurately determines stacking displacement, with an error level of 3.3% displacement within the unit cell and a spatial resolution approaching the individual unit&#8208;cell level. Additionally, the model successfully processes a large set of in situ TEM data, capturing spatially varying, time&#8208;dependent interlayer displacement dynamics associated with edge reconstruction, demonstrating its potential for processing large&#8208;scale microscopy datasets.

         <title>Hole&#8208;selective Transparent In Situ Passivation Contacts for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Graded Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an in situ internal encapsulation strategy by integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into the antisolvent to construct a highly hole&#8208;selective, transparent, and robust passivation contact. The 1.65 eV n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSC achieves a 19.8% PCE, with better thermal, UV, and operational stabilities, and a bifaciality of 101.4%, alongside a 29.2% certified PCE tandem cell.








Abstract
The optically deficient and intrinsically unstable hole transport layer (HTL) is the Achilles&#8217; heel of n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. Here, a minimalist transparent hole&#8208;selective contact is developed without additional HTL by simply integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into antisolvent. This strategy not only improves the perovskite crystallinity, shields the perovskite from external stressors, and suppresses interfacial mass exchange, but also provides efficient defect passivation and favorable band alignment via the formation of graded heterojunction. Consequently, the corresponding 1.65 eV perovskite solar cell achieves a stabilized efficiency of 19.6%, alongside significantly improved thermal, ultraviolet, and operation stabilities. Furthermore, leveraging its outstanding transparency, a bifacial single&#8208;junction device is showcased achieving a record bifaciality of 101.4%, and a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem boasting a certified efficiency of 29.2% for 1.04 cm2, which represents the highest certified efficiency achieved for n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. The demonstration of efficient and stable minimalist hole&#8208;selective contacts encourages the tandem community to reevaluate the n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure, with the goal of harnessing the high open&#8208;circuit voltage of single&#8208;junction n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs.

         <title>An Electron Transfer Mediated Mechanism for Efficient Photoreforming of Waste Plastics Using a Ni3S4/ZnCdS Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is prepared for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. The catalyst exhibits high H2 production rates of 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with selectivities of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from PLA and PET, respectively.








Abstract
The oxidative degradation of plastics in conjunction with the production of clean hydrogen (H2) represents a significant challenge. Herein, a Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is rationally synthesized and employed for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. By integrating spectroscopic analysis techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a solely electron transfer&#8208;mediated reaction mechanism is confirmed, wherein Ni3S4 extracts electrons from ZnCdS (ZCS) to promote the spatial segregation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which not only facilitates H2 production but also maintains the high oxidation potential of holes on the ZCS&#160;surface, favoring hole&#8208;dominated plastic oxidation. Notably, the catalyst exhibited efficient H2 production rates as high as 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with a selectivity of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), respectively. Additionally, carbon yields of 26.5% for pyruvate and 2.2% for acetate are measured after 9 h of photoreforming, representing the highest values reported to date. Overall, this research presents a promising approach for converting plastic waste into H2 fuel and high&#8208;selectivity valuable chemical products, offering a potential solution to the growing issue of &#8220;White Pollution&#8221;.

         <title>Win&#8211;Win Integration of Genetically Engineered Cellular Nanovesicles with High&#8208;Absorbing Multimodal Phototheranostic Molecules for Boosted Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergistic approach utilizing genetically engineered cancer cellular nanovesicles displaying PD&#8208;1 ligands as both tumor&#8208;targeted nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents, combined with high&#8208;absorbing multimodal AIEgens as phototheranostic module is developed to implement NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging while simultaneously improve the efficacy of photo&#8208;immunotherapy for both primary and distant metastatic tumors.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;immunotherapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment strategies. As immunotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) exhibit substantial potential, but have to face non&#8208;specific distribution and the subsequent immune&#8208;related adverse events. Meanwhile, high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents concurrently possessing multiple phototheranostic modalities and high light&#8208;harvesting capacity are really attractive and highly desired as touching phototheranostic modules. Herein, a win&#8211;win strategy that integrates phototheranostic molecule design and targeted immunotherapeutic module preparation is developed to construct high&#8208;powered photo&#8208;immunotherapy systems. Specifically, the phototheranostic agent (AOTTIT) displaying typical aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence extending to the second near&#8208;infrared II window, as well as outstanding reactive oxygen species and heat production capacity is first obtained via ingenious design. Notably, AOTTIT exhibits a record high molar extinction coefficient among the reported organic multimodal phototheranostic molecules. Meanwhile, PD&#8208;1 genetically engineered cancer cell membrane&#8208;derived nanovesicles (PD&#8208;1/CMNVs) are prepared as both nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents to camouflage AOTTIT nanoparticles, yielding a multifunctional photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agent (CMNPs/PD&#8208;1) with tumor&#8208;specific active and homologous targeting ability. The distinct suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumors after only once treatment to the primary tumor substantiated the synergistically strengthened photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficiency of this win&#8208;win strategy.

&lt;p&gt;Photo-immunotherapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment strategies. As immunotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) exhibit substantial potential, but have to face non-specific distribution and the subsequent immune-related adverse events. Meanwhile, high-performance phototheranostic agents concurrently possessing multiple phototheranostic modalities and high light-harvesting capacity are really attractive and highly desired as touching phototheranostic modules. Herein, a win&#8211;win strategy that integrates phototheranostic molecule design and targeted immunotherapeutic module preparation is developed to construct high-powered photo-immunotherapy systems.

The distinct suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumors after only once treatment to the primary tumor substantiated the synergistically strengthened photo-immunotherapeutic efficiency of this win-win strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Arylamine&#8208;Linked Porous Organic Polymers with Abundant Redox&#8208;Active Sites as High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A series of novel arylamine&#8208;linked and bipolar porous organic polymers (POPs) are designed and prepared as organic cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Benefiting from their high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;rate, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability as organic cathode materials for LIBs.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as promising and sustainable organic cathode materials (OCMs) for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their performance is significantly limited by insufficient redox&#8208;active sites and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, a series of novel arylamine&#8208;linked and bipolar POPs (denoted as HATN&#8208;AQ, HATN&#8208;BQ, HATN&#8208;CBD, and HATN&#8208;PTO) are designed and prepared as OCMs for LIBs. Benefiting from their high density of redox&#8208;active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high capacity, high rate, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. Among them, HATN&#8208;PTO displayed an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 329.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 with a high energy density of 716.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, outstanding rate performance (208.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and superior cycling stability (188.9 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retained after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the HATN&#8208;PTO//graphite full battery exhibited a high specific capacity of 227.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and maintained a high capacity of 99.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Ex situ FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra combined with theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. This work provides an effective strategy for designing POPs with high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate for OCMs.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Reinforcing Ether Coordination of Localized High Concentration Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of Pyr13TFSI as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics.








Abstract
The decomposition of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) under high voltage produces fragile and unstable organic fragments at the cathode/electrolyte interphase, which greatly damages the cycling performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, a robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of 1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr13TFSI) as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte to significantly improve the stability of solvated DME through reinforcing the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between TFSI&#8722; and DME. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 coin cells with Pyr13TFSI exhibit capacity retention of 76.1% after 1800 cycles at 1&#160;C rate (4.5 V), and 77.1% after 800 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. Furthermore, the cells using Li anode with the thickness of 50 &#181;m and high LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 loading of 18.68 mg cm&#8722;2 can operate for 175 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of 73.35%. This work demonstrates that modulating the interactions among electrolyte components using ionic liquid can optimize the coordination chemistry for advanced high&#8208;energy density Li metal batteries.

2D polymeric C60 is an emerging all&#8208;carbon semiconductor possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. A hydrogen&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy has been developed to produce gram&#8208;scale large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). The thin&#8208;film photodetectors demonstrate broad spectral response from visible light to near&#8208;infrared region.








Abstract
2D polymeric fullerene scaffolds, composed of covalently bonded superatomic C60 nanoclusters, are emerging semiconductors possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. Hitherto their synthesis has relied on complex and time&#8208;consuming reactions, thereby hindering scalable production and limiting the technological relevance. Here, the study demonstrates a facile electrochemical exfoliation strategy based on the intercalation and expansion of a layered fullerene superlattice, to produce large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). In situ reduction of solvated protons (H+) weakens the interlayer interactions thereby promoting the rapid and uniform intercalation of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium (TBA+), ensuring gram&#8208;scale throughput and high structural integrity of exfoliated 2D polymeric C60. As a proof of concept, the solution&#8208;processed 2D polymeric C60 nanosheets have been integrated into thin&#8208;film photodetectors, exhibiting a broad spectral photoresponse ranging from 405 to 1200 nm, with a peak photocurrent at 850 nm and a stable response time. This efficient and scalable exfoliation method holds great promise for the advancement of multifunctional composites and optoelectronic devices based on 2D polymeric C60.

         <title>Mechanosensitive and pH&#8208;Gated Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Artificial Ion Channel for High&#8208;Selective K+ Transport and Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural ion channels, this research presents a novel butterfly&#8208;shaped bionic K+ transmembrane channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) with record&#8208;breaking K+/Na+ selectivity. The unique mobile channels constructed from poly (propylene imine) dendritic polymers and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;ethers exhibit dual mechanical and pH responsiveness in liposomes/cells. Drastic G4C7&#8208;induced intracellular K+ efflux effectively activates mitochondrial&#8208; and ER&#8208;associated apoptosis.








Abstract
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural multi&#8208;gated ion channels, a novel butterfly&#8208;shaped biomimetic K+ channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) is developed with dual mechanical and pH responsiveness, exhibiting unprecedented K+/Na+ selectivity (G3C7: 34.4; G4C7: 41.3). These channels constructed from poly(propylene imine) dendrimer and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;ethers achieve high K+ transport activity (EC50: 0.72 &#181;m for G3C7; 0.9 &#181;m for G4C7) due to their arc&#8208;like mechanical rotation. The dynamic mode relies on butterfly&#8208;shaped topology derived from the highly symmetrical core and multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds. GnC7 can sense mechanical stimulus applied to liposomes/cells and then adapt the K+ transport rate accordingly. Furthermore, reversible ON/OFF switching of K+ transport is realized through the pH&#8208;controllable host&#8208;guest complexation.

     alt="Mechanosensitive and pH-Gated Butterfly-Shaped Artificial Ion Channel for High-Selective K+ Transport and Cancer Cell Apoptosis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural ion channels, this research presents a novel butterfly-shaped bionic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transmembrane channel &lt;b&gt;GnC7&lt;/b&gt; (n = 3, 4) with record-breaking K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity. The unique mobile channels constructed from poly (propylene imine) dendritic polymers and benzo-21-crown-7-ethers exhibit dual mechanical and pH responsiveness in liposomes/cells. Drastic &lt;b&gt;G4C7&lt;/b&gt;-induced intracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux effectively activates mitochondrial- and ER-associated apoptosis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural multi-gated ion channels, a novel butterfly-shaped biomimetic K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel &lt;b&gt;GnC7&lt;/b&gt; (n = 3, 4) is developed with dual mechanical and pH responsiveness, exhibiting unprecedented K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; selectivity (&lt;b&gt;G3C7&lt;/b&gt;: 34.4; &lt;b&gt;G4C7&lt;/b&gt;: 41.3). These channels constructed from poly(propylene imine) dendrimer and benzo-21-crown-7-ethers achieve high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport activity (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;: 0.72 &#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;b&gt;G3C7&lt;/b&gt;; 0.9 &#181;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;b&gt;G4C7&lt;/b&gt;) due to their arc-like mechanical rotation. The dynamic mode relies on butterfly-shaped topology derived from the highly symmetrical core and multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds. &lt;b&gt;GnC7&lt;/b&gt; can sense mechanical stimulus applied to liposomes/cells and then adapt the K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport rate accordingly. Furthermore, reversible ON/OFF switching of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is realized through the pH-controllable host-guest complexation. &lt;b&gt;G4C7&lt;/b&gt;-induced ultrafast cellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux (70% within only 9 min) efficiently triggers mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis of cancer cells by provoking endoplasmic reticulum stress accompanied by drastic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks.

         <title>Abnormal Slow Phonon Dynamics Toward Prolonging Excited States Dynamics Enabled by Crystalline&#8208;Assembling Donor&#8211;Acceptor Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline&#8208;packing donor&#8211;acceptor molecular structures into dipolar crystals enables slow phonon dynamics from lattice vibrations when optical phonons develop mutual&#8208;opposite phase relations. Through electron&#8211;phonon coupling, slow phonon dynamics interact with light&#8208;emitting singlet charge&#8208;transfer states containing contribution from triplets through triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet intersystem crossing, consequently leading to extended excited states dynamics with prolonged PL lifetime shown as super&#8208;delayed fluorescence in dipolar organic crystals.








Abstract
Phonon dynamics are a critical factor to control the optical properties of excited states in light&#8208;emitting materials. Here, we report an extremely slow relaxation of photoexcited lattice vibrations enabled by assembling the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules [2&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthene 10,10&#8208;dioxide], namely AC molecules, into dipolar crystal. By using photoexcitation&#8208;modulated Raman spectroscopy, we find that the crystalline&#8208;lattice vibrations monitored by Raman&#8208;scattering laser beam of 785&#160;nm demonstrate an un&#8208;usual slow relaxation in the time scale of seconds after ceasing photoexcitation beam of 343&#160;nm in such dipolar crystal. This presents extremely slow phonon dynamics enabled by crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into a dipolar crystal. Simultaneously, the photoluminescence (PL) exhibits a prolonged behavior, lasting 10&#160;ms after ceasing photoexcitation in dipolar AC crystal. This phenomenon provides an experimental hypothesis that the slow phonon dynamics function as an important mechanism to unusually prolong excited states dynamics upon crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into dipolar crystal. This hypothesis can be verified by directly suppressing the phonon dynamics through freezing D&#8211;A molecular liquid into dipolar crystalline solid at 77 K to largely prolong the PL to 1 s&#8208; after removing photoexcitation. Clearly, crystalline&#8208;assembling D&#8211;A molecules provide the necessary conditions to enable slow phonon dynamics toward prolonging excited states dynamics.

         <title>Rational Design of Methylated Triazine&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction with Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is developed for successful photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. The key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks.








Abstract
The development of semiconducting conjugated polymers for photoredox catalysis holds great promise for sustainable utilization of solar energy. Herein a new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is reported that enable efficient photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. It is demonstrated that the key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks. It is also shown that regulating conjugated linear backbones with different lengths of electron&#8208;donated benzyl units provides a facile means to modulate their optical properties and the exciton dissociation, thereby affording more long&#8208;lived photogenerated charge carriers and boosting charge separation and transfer. A high&#8208;performance carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 218.9 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved with &#8776; 100% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by exceptional H2O oxidation to oxygen (O2). It anticipates this new study will advance synthetic approaches toward polymeric semiconductors and facilitate new possibilities for triazine&#8208;based conjugated polymers with promising potential in artificial photocatalysis.

         <title>Pillared Laminar Vermiculite Membranes with Tunable Monovalent and Multivalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alumina pillared vermiculite membrane is fabricated with a laminar structure. Enhanced water stability is observed due to the strengthened interlamellar binding. Through cation doping, the surface charge and pore size of the pillared laminar membrane are tuned, demonstrating highly selective and tunable ion sieving performance promising for water treatment and resource recovery applications.








Abstract
Effective membrane separation of Li+ from Na+ and Mg2+ is crucial for lithium extraction from water yet challenging for conventional polymeric membranes. Two dimensional (2D)&#160;membranes with ordered laminar structures and tunable physicochemical properties offer distinctive ion&#8208;sieving capabilities promising for lithium extraction. Recently, phyllosilicates are introduced as abundant and cost&#8208;effective source materials for such membranes. However, their water instability and low inherent ion transport selectivity hinder practical applications. Herein, a new class of laminar membranes with excellent stability and tunable ion sieving is reported by incorporating inorganic alumina pillars into vermiculite interlayers. Crosslinking vermiculite flakes with alumina pillars significantly strengthens interlamellar interactions, resulting in robust water stability. Doping of Na+ before the pillaring process reverses the membrane's surface charge, substantially boosting Li+ separation from multivalent cations via electrostatic interactions. Lithium extraction is often complicated by the presence of co&#8208;existing monovalent cations (e.g., Na+) at higher concentrations. Here, by introducing excess Na+ into the membrane after the pillaring process, the separation of Li+ from monovalent cations is enhanced through steric effects. This work realizes both monovalent/multivalent and monovalent/monovalent selective ion sieving with the same membrane platform. A separation mechanism is proposed based on Donnan exclusion and size exclusion, providing new insights for membrane design for resource recovery applications.

         <title>Red Phosphorescence at Elevated Temperatures Enabled by Dexter Energy Transfer in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon&#8208;Xanthone Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure Organic red persistent phosphorescent materials, possessing high&#8208;temperature resistance and superior tissue penetration, can be efficiently fabricated using a host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer process plays a crucial role in modulating the luminescent properties of both the host and the guest. These materials hold promise for applications in advanced information encryption and bioimaging.








Abstract
Organic materials with red persistent phosphorescence hold immense promise for biotechnology due to their excellent tissue permeability and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. However, inefficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling, high triplet susceptibility, and narrow energy gapspromoted&#160;nonradiative deactivations, pose a formidable obstacle to achieving efficient red phosphorescence. This study addresses these challenges by introducing xanthone (Xan)&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems.

This DET process between Xan and PAHs not only effectively utilizes the dark triplet state of the Xan host but also significantly enhances the triplet generation of the PAH guests, transforming them into potent phosphorescent luminophores. Furthermore, the inherent rigidity of Xan and PAHs endows the resulting materials with excellent phosphorescence performance, even at elevated temperatures (e.g., 423 K). This strategy, proven to be general, paves the way for designing efficient red/NIR phosphorescent materials through the DET mechanism, enabling their applications in molecular imaging and advanced high&#8208;temperature encryption.

&lt;p&gt;Pure Organic red persistent phosphorescent materials, possessing high-temperature resistance and superior tissue penetration, can be efficiently fabricated using a host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The triplet-to-triplet Dexter energy transfer process plays a crucial role in modulating the luminescent properties of both the host and the guest. These materials hold promise for applications in advanced information encryption and bioimaging.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic materials with red persistent phosphorescence hold immense promise for biotechnology due to their excellent tissue permeability and high signal-to-background ratios. However, inefficient spin-orbit coupling, high triplet susceptibility, and narrow energy gapspromoted&#160;nonradiative deactivations, pose a formidable obstacle to achieving efficient red phosphorescence. This study addresses these challenges by introducing xanthone (Xan)-based host&#8211;guest systems. Utilizing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as guests, efficient red to near-infrared (NIR) phosphorescent materials with ultralong lifetimes and high quantum yields of up to 821 ms and 2.32%, respectively, are successfully developed.

         <title>Photopolymer Resins from Sulfenyl Chloride Commodity Chemicals for Plastic Optics, Photopatterning and 3D&#8208;Printing</title>

From oil refining to high refractive index photopolymers for bulk plastic optics. The synthesis of a new photopolymer resin derived from inexpensive sulfur petrochemicals is reported affording a high&#8208;quality optical glass that is amenable to a wide range of photopolymerization&#8208;based fabricated methods, including 3D Printing, for precision plastic optics and micropatterned arrays.








Abstract
The development of a low&#8208;cost photopolymer resin to fabricate optical glass of high refractive index for plastic optics is reported. This new free radically polymerizable photopolymer resin, termed, disulfide methacrylate resin (DSMR) is synthesized by the direct addition of allyl methacrylate to a commodity sulfur petrochemical, sulfur monochloride (S2Cl2). The rapid rates of free radical photopolymerization confer significant advantages in preparing high&#8208;quality, bulk optical glass. The low&#8208;cost, optical glass produced from this photopolymer possesses a desirable combination of high refractive index (n&#160;&#8776;&#160;1.57&#8211;1.59), low birefringence (&#916;n&#160;&lt;&#160;10&#8722;4), high glass transition values (Tg&#160;&#8776;&#160;100&#160;&#176;C), along with optical transparency rivaling, or exceeding that of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as indicated by very low optical absorption coefficients (&#945;&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 1310&#160;nm) measured for thick glass DSMR photopolymer samples (diameter (D)&#160;=&#160;25&#160;mm; thickness&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;30&#160;mm). The versatile manufacturability of DSMR photopolymers for both molding and diamond turn machining methods is demonstrated to prepare precision optics and nano&#8208;micropatterned arrays. Finally, large&#8208;scale 3D printing vat photopolymerization of DSMR using high&#8208;area rapid printing digital light processing additive manufacturing is demonstrated.

         <title>Leveraging Strong Electric Field Gradients at Anapole Resonances for Enhanced Second Harmonic Generation from Molybdenum Disulfide Disks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks supporting combined anapole scattering and Fabry&#8208;Perot resonances with not just strong electric field enhancement but also enhanced field gradients for application in resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) are designed, fabricated, and experimentally studied. Some of the highest enhancement numbers reported for the case of the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype of MoS2 are reported.








Abstract
Van der Waals layered materials are emerging as promising nanophotonic platforms for realizing linear and nonlinear optical devices. In particular, the high refractive indices of transition metal dichalcogenides, combined with their strong layer dependent optical properties offer interesting possibilities for designing photonic functionalities. In this study, the resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks on a silicon substrate with an intermediate silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer is demonstrated. The resonant enhancement observed here is attributed to the combined interaction of the anapole scattering modes supported within the disk and Fabry&#8208;Perot (FP) modes within the multilayer stack. For a fixed MoS2 disk dimensions, an optimized SiO2 layer thickness results in constructive interference between the anapole and FP modes, thereby enhancing the fundamental field within the disk. Utilizing this resonance mechanism, SHG enhancements as high as 160 and 85&#8208;times are experimentally demonstrated when compared with unpatterned multilayer and monolayer MoS2 flakes respectively. These are the highest reported enhancement values for the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype MoS2. A significant enhancement in SHG is observed here for 2H&#8208;MoS2 despite the alternating sheet dipoles canceling the far&#8208;field emission owing to the strong electric field gradient setup within the disk at the anapole resonance.

Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows offer energy&#8208;saving potential through temperature&#8208;responsive optical transmittance adjustments, yet face challenges in achieving anti&#8208;UV radiation, fast response, and high&#8208;temperature stability characteristics for long&#8208;term use. Herein, the rational design of Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced, nanoparticle&#8208;shielded composite hydrogels, composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAA), sodium sulfate, and polydopamine nanoparticles, for anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and all&#8208;day&#8208;modulated smart windows is reported. Specifically, a three&#8208;dimensional network of PDMAA is created as the supporting skeleton, markedly enhancing the thermal stability of pristine HPMC hydrogels. Sodium sulfate induces a Hofmeister effect, lowering the lower critical solution temperature to 32 &#176;C while accelerating phase transition rates fivefold (30 s vs. 150 s). Intriguingly, small&#8208;sized polydopamine nanoparticles simultaneously enable high luminous transmittance of 66.9% and outstanding anti&#8208;UV capability. Additionally, the smart window showcases a high solar modulation (51.2%) and maintains a 10.2 &#176;C temperature reduction versus a glass window during all&#8208;day modulation applications. The design strategy is effective, opening up new avenues for manufacturing fast&#8208;response and durable thermochromic smart windows for energy savings and emission reduction.

         <title>Point Defects Enhance Cross&#8208;Plane Thermal Conductivity In Graphite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects typically reduce thermal conductivity (&#954;) by scattering heat&#8208;carrying phonons. However, introducing spiro interstitials through particle irradiation in graphite surprisingly increases cross&#8208;plane &#954; from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The scanning transmission electron microscope and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that these defects bridge graphene planes, increasing group velocity while reducing phonon&#8208;phonon scattering, thereby enhancing cross&#8208;plane &#954; of graphite.








Abstract
Point defects typically reduce the thermal conductivity (&#954;) of a crystal due to increased scattering of heat&#8208;carrying phonons, a mechanism that is well understood and widely used to enhance or impede heat transfer in the material for different applications.

&lt;p&gt;Point defects typically reduce thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;) by scattering heat-carrying phonons. However, introducing spiro interstitials through particle irradiation in graphite surprisingly increases cross-plane &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature. The scanning transmission electron microscope and first-principles calculations reveal that these defects bridge graphene planes, increasing group velocity while reducing phonon-phonon scattering, thereby enhancing cross-plane &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; of graphite.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Point defects typically reduce the thermal conductivity (&lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt;) of a crystal due to increased scattering of heat-carrying phonons, a mechanism that is well understood and widely used to enhance or impede heat transfer in the material for different applications. Here an opposite effect is reported where the introduction of point defects in graphite with energetic particle irradiation increases its cross-plane &lt;i&gt;&#954;&lt;/i&gt; by nearly a factor of two, from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two MCOFs with dual&#8208;active centers are designed as LMB separators to enable efficient Li plating/stripping. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and electron&#8208;donating diarylamine nitrogen create an electron&#8208;rich environment, regulating the local conjugated Li+ microenvironment. The designed Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent Li plating/stripping stability for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has gained attention as an anode material for lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) owing to its low electrochemical potential, high specific capacity, and low density. However, the accumulation of Li dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphases, caused by sluggish Li+ migration and uneven Li deposition, limit practical LMB applications. This study presents the first report on redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with dual&#8208;active centers as functional separators for LMBs. These MCOFs facilitate homogeneous Li nucleation and accelerate Li+ ion transport. The synergistic effects of redox&#8208;active diarylamine units and trinuclear copper clusters modulate local electron&#8208;cloud density, regulating microenvironment of Li+ ions and ensuring homogeneous Li nucleation. The MCOF&#8208;based separator's well&#8208;defined 1D channels in MCOF&#8208;based separator enable uniform Li+ flux, and promote homogeneous Li deposition, resulting in high Li+ transference number of 0.93 and an ionic conductivity of 2.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The Li|Cu cell demonstrates a low Li nucleation barrier of 16 mV, while the Li symmetric cell exhibits stable Li plating/stripping for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the assembled LMB exhibits stable capacity retention of &#8776;98%. This work paves the way for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes in high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Inverse Oxide/Alloy&#8208;Structured Nanozymes with NIR&#8208;Triggered Enzymatic Cascade Regulation of ROS Homeostasis for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme, Co7Fe3/ZnO@C, is developed to achieve near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered enzymatic cascade regulation. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, hot electrons are transferred from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, activating synchronized superoxide dismutase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, peroxidase&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity&#8208;like enzymatic activities. These cascaded activities enable spatiotemporal modulation of reactive oxygen species dynamics, synergistically integrating chemodynamic therapy, photodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy to accelerate infected wound healing.








Abstract
The precise spatiotemporal control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenging remains pivotal for infected wound healing. However, conventional nanozymes fail to adaptively regulate ROS dynamics across inflammatory and proliferative phases. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;activated inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme (Co7Fe3/ZnO@C) is developed, featuring enzymatic cascade activities to tune ROS homeostasis through synergistic chemodynamic (CDT), photodynamic (PDT), and photothermal (PTT) therapies. The nanozyme orchestrates a self&#8208;regulated cascade: peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity initially generates bactericidal hydroxyl radicals in acidic wounds, while subsequent NIR triggers hot electron transfer from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, facilitating synchronized superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) activities to scavenge residual ROS. This cascaded network dynamically balances ROS production (POD) and scavenging (NIR&#8208;driven SOD/CAT/HORAC), eradicating bacteria while resolving inflammation. In vitro/vivo studies have shown that the proposed method for maintaining ROS homeostasis can markedly enhance the rate of wound healing by the regulation of the inflammatory environment within the injured tissue and the facilitation of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization. This work provides an intelligent nanozyme platform that simulates the function of natural enzymes and constructs a cascade reaction strategy to balance the antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory demands in the wound microenvironment.

         <title>Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Type I Photodynamic Therapy for Agonist Independent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis of mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanodrugs containing a BODIPY&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer and a dual nanozyme for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. Their tumor therapeutic ability, dual nanozyme activities, mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation, and intratumoral and systemic immunositimulation capacity underscore their potential as a paradigm for efficient photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
CGAS&#8208;STING agonists generally lead to hyperimmunity and systemic toxicity, hindering their immunotherapeutic outcomes. Herein, a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist (termed HABH) containing boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer (BDP) and Au&#160;nanoparticle&#8208;engineered hollow mesoporous silica (HMSN/AuNPs) has been fabricated for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. The HABH nanoagonist can actively target tumor tissues and release the mitochondrion&#8208;targeted BDP. Under light illumination, BDP achieves type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) in mitochondria, generating massive hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and inducing mitochondrial stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner, promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Simultaneously, the HMSN/AuNPs act as dual nanozymes to derive cascade reactions for &#8226;OH production, elevating the intracellular oxidative state, and together with the BDP&#8208;induced mitochondrial stress, finally evoking the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and facilitating the release of type I interferon. In the orthotopic breast tumor models, the HABH nanoagonist achieved intratumoral and systemic immunoactivation for eradicating primary tumors and preventing metastasis tumors. Therefore, the constructed mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist enabled light&#8208;controlled and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING activation, providing a paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid based wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte inducing static and dynamic interface double shields of Zn anodes is developed for achieving highly stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an operating temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;40&#8211;60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have experienced substantial advancements recently, while the aqueous electrolytes exhibit limited thermal adaptability. The low&#8208;cost Zn(BF4)2 salt possesses potential low&#8208;temperature application, while brings unsatisfied stability of Zn anodes. To address this challenge, an ionic liquid based eutectic electrolyte (ILEE) utilizing the Zn(BF4)2 presenting remarkable stability across a temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;100&#8211;150 &#176;C is developed, enabling ZIBs to operate in diverse thermal conditions.

         <title>Biplane Ion&#8208;Pairing Induced Supramolecular Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Uranium Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) pincer complex probe is proposed to achieve the direct recognition of anionic [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; using a new strategy where the overlapping of thick hydration shells drives an assembly. This hydration&#8208;shell&#8208;promoted assembly endows the probe with excellent specificity, a rapid response, and high sensitivity (14.89&#160;fg). This study paves the way for exploring new approaches for the direct detection of highly hydrated ions.








Abstract
It is still challenging to directly recognize the anionic species [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, the dominant species in the environment (82%&#8208;93%), using current optical probes because of the adverse effects of its thick hydration shell on binding interactions. In this study, a water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) methylated terpyridine complex ([Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+) supramolecular probe is designed to directly target [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; by a new strategy of thick hydration shell overlapping arrangement. The optical response demonstrates excellent selectivity among &#8776;30 investigated interfering substances, along with rapid response (&#8776;15&#160;s), high sensitivity (64.1&#160;nm) and dual&#8208;signals. It is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the superior detection performance is attributed to the formation of a unique supramolecular structure featuring biplane&#8208;like building block, bicolumnar stacking and water&#8208;bridged anionic networks, via the overlap of thick hydration shells of aligned [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; to boost a superentropic driving force, and the distinguishable dual&#8208;signals arises from the emergence of four types of Pt&#8208;Pt interactions, generating low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer adsorption/emission. In addition, a [Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+&#8208;based hydrogel platform is constructed for detecting both anionic and cationic uranium, with a detection limit of 14.89&#160;fg. This work unlocks not only a way to directly detect [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, but also a new idea for sensing ions with extreme thick hydration layers.

         <title>Incorporating Ordered Indium Sites into Rhodium for Ultra&#8208;Low Potential Electrocatalytic Conversion of Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating ordered oxyphilic In sites into Rh to form RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) facilitates the ultra&#8208;low&#8208;potential electrooxidation of ethylene glycol into the high&#8208;value chemical, glycolic acid. The synthesized RhIn IMCs&#160;also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Using RhIn&#160;IMCs as bifunctional catalysts, a two&#8208;electrode system is established for ethylene glycol electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production.








Abstract
The upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA, a biodegradable polymer monomer) via electrocatalysis not only produces valuable chemicals but also mitigates plastic pollution. However, the current reports for electrooxidation of EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA usually operate at reaction potentials of &gt;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than the theoretical potential (0.065 V vs RHE), resulting in substantial energy wastage. Herein, body&#8208;centered cubic RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) anchored on carbon support (denoted as RhIn/C) are synthesized, which shows excellent performance for the EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA with an onset potential of only 0.35 V vs RHE, lower than the values reported in current literature. The catalyst also possesses satisfactory GA selectivity (85% at 0.65 V vs RHE). Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that RhIn IMCs enhance the adsorption of EG and OH&#8722;, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species and thereby improving catalytic performance. RhIn/C also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, ensuring that it can be used as a bifunctional catalyst in the two&#8208;electrode system for EG electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production. This work opens new avenues for reducing the energy consumption of electrocatalytic upcycling of PET&#8208;derived EG and clean energy production.

         <title>3D Molecular&#8208;Reconstructed Disordered Precursor Toward Highly Stable Porous Ramie Carbon</title>

3D disordered ramie precursors (DRPs) with high mechanical strength and high density are achieved via the molecular reconstruction method. As a demonstration, this highly stable porous ramie carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor delivers a prominent energy density of 28.11 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;power density of 47.94 kW kg&#8722;1 simultaneously, evidently higher than commercial YP&#8208;50F (12.67 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 40.86 kW kg&#8722;1).








Abstract
Biomass porous carbon possesses broad application prospects in the field of energy storage. However, soft biomass materials with high cellulose content and orders structure usually represent low mechanical strength, which leads to unstable pore structure of prepared porous carbon and even prone to collapse, thus reducing the quality and stability of carbon. Herein, a simple molecular reconstruction method is proposed to effectively re&#8208;construct 3D disordered ramie precursors (DRPs) by regulating the chemical interaction of hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from high mechanical strength and high density of DRPs, the highly stable porous ramie carbon (PRC) can display a higher specific surface area of 2404.36 m2 g&#8722;1 than that of ordinary ramie carbon (2142.25 m2 g&#8722;1). Moreover, this PRC&#8208;based supercapacitor delivers a high specific capacitance of 39.35 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.5% at 40 A g&#8722;1 in 1 M Et4NBF4/AN. Attractively, the evolution process of ion adsorption during the charge&#8211;discharge process has been uncovered by using in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy, confirming the excellent structural stability of PRC. This work provides new insights into preparing biomass precursors with high strength derived from soft biomass materials, greatly promoting the application of soft biomass materials in commercial activated carbon.

         <title>Hierarchical&#8208;Structured RGO@EGaIn Composites as Advanced Self&#8208;Healing Anode for Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery</title>

GO naturally adsorbs onto the surface of LMPs via electrostatic interactions, self&#8208;assembles into a core&#8211;shell structure, and subsequently reduces to RGO in an acidic solution. The presence of RGO in the hierarchical structural composites significantly improves the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, suppressing and accommodating the irregular deformation of LMPs during the electrochemical reaction process and promoting the formation of a stable SEI film.









Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) has emerged as a promising candidate anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting high theoretical capacity, excellent electrode kinetics, and unique self&#8208;healing ability. However, the liquid&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid transition during the electrochemical reactions can disrupt the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and damage the structural integrity, ultimately limiting the cycling stability. Here, hierarchical&#8208;structured reduced graphene oxide coated eutectic gallium&#8208;indium liquid metal particles (RGO@EGaIn LMPs) are synthesized using a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy. The customized RGO@EGaIn electrode demonstrated impressive performance in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations for LIBs. The morphological and phase transitions of RGO@EGaIn LMPs during the lithiation/delithiation processes are uncovered by real&#8208;time in situ transmission electron microscopy tests. It is clarified that the presence of RGO in the hierarchical structure buffers the volume expansion of LMPs from &#8776;160% to 125% and provides a fast pathway for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons during the electrochemical reaction, which effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the electrode. This work introduces a straightforward and effective method for preparing high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature liquid metal electrodes, representing a significant step forward toward the commercial application of liquid metal batteries.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Decoupling Drives Gold&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation of Large&#8208;Area Monolayer 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au substrate induces a strain in the adhered bottommost MoS2 layer. The strain weakens the coupling at the first MoS2&#8208;MoS2 interface, making it the weakest point in the system, therefore MoS2 crystal preferentially cleaves at this interface, facilitating the selective exfoliation of large&#8208;area monolayers with size comparable to that of the parent crystal.








Abstract
Gold&#8208;assisted exfoliation (GAE) is a groundbreaking mechanical exfoliation technique that produces centimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal monolayers of 2D materials. Such large, high&#8208;quality films offer unparalleled advantages over the micron&#8208;sized flakes typically produced by conventional exfoliation techniques, significantly accelerating the research and technological advancements in the field of 2D materials. Despite its wide applications, the fundamental mechanism of GAE remains poorly understood. In this study, using MoS&#8322; on Au as a model system, ultra&#8208;low frequency Raman spectroscopy is employed to elucidate how the interlayer interactions within MoS2 crystals are impacted by the gold substrate. The results reveal that the coupling at the first MoS2&#8208;MoS2 interface between the adhered layer on the gold substrate and the adjacent layer is substantially weakened, with the binding force being reduced to nearly zero. This renders the first interface the weakest point in the system, thereby the crystal preferentially cleaves at this junction, generating large&#8208;area monolayers with sizes comparable to the parent crystal. Biaxial strain in the adhered layer, induced by the gold substrate, is identified as the driving factor for the decoupling effect. The strain&#8208;induced decoupling effect is established as the primary mechanism of GAE, which can also play a significant role in general mechanical exfoliations.

         <title>&#8220;Water&#8208;In&#8208;Oil&#8221; Electrolyte Enabled by Microphase Separation Regulation for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separated &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8221; (W/O) electrolyte is proposed to simultaneously regulate the water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and electrode interface. Benefiting from the directed movement and reversible demulsification of micelles under the electric field, the as&#8208;developed zinc metal batteries using W/O electrolyte exhibits extended cyclability, improve interface dynamics and negligible H2 evolution.








Abstract
The sustained hydrogen evolution and zinc (Zn) dendrite growth greatly impede the practical application of low&#8208;cost aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, a microphase separation strategy is proposed to construct a &#8243;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (W/O) electrolyte to endow durable ZMBs. As validated by theoretical modeling and experimental characterizations, the unique reverse micelle structure within the electrolyte not only disrupts water hydrogen bonding and efficiently inhibits the water consumption at Zn anode, but also undergoes directed movement and reversible demulsification under electric field, thus enhancing the anode desolvation kinetics and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Owing to the simultaneous regulation of water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and anode interface, this W/O electrolyte achieves a high Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.76% over 6000 cycles, and maintains an extend lifespan in Zn||V10O24&#183;12H2O (VOH) cells with negligible hydrogen evolution and dendrite formation. These key findings are expected to promote the electrolyte engineering toward reversible ZMBs.

         <title>Kinetically Dormant Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode During High&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered cathode remains thermodynamically reversible but undergoes dramatic kinetic degradation at high voltage, leading to the commonly observed capacity loss that in fact can be recovered under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from layered/rock&#8208;salt structural heterogeneity during charge.








Abstract
The degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during long&#8208;term operation at high voltage has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite many post&#8208;mortem qualitative structural analyses, precise quantification of their individual and coupling contributions to the overall capacity degradation remains challenging. Here, by leveraging multiscale synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes, electron microscopy, and post&#8208;galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, the thermodynamically irreversible and kinetically reversible capacity loss is successfully deconvoluted in a polycrystalline LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 cathode during long&#8208;term charge/discharge cycling in full cell configuration. Contradicting the dramatic capacity loss, the layered structure remains highly alive even after 1000 cycles at 4.6 V while undergoing a three&#8208;order of magnitude reduction in the mass transfer kinetics, leading to almost fully recoverable capacity under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior after cycling is not simply ascribed to poor chemical diffusion by reconstructed cathode surface but highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from the structural heterogeneity between deeply delithiated layered and degraded rock&#8208;salt phases at high voltage. These findings deepen the degradation mechanism of high&#8208;voltage cathodes to achieve long&#8208;cycling and fast&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Computing with Visual&#8208;Tactile Perception Enabled by Mechano&#8208;Optical Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechano&#8208;optical artificial synapse that enables in&#8208;sensor computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception is achieved by integrating photostimulated luminescence with self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescence materials.

Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing paradigm holds the promise of realizing rapid and low&#8208;power signal processing. Constructing crossmodal in&#8208;sensor computing systems to emulate human sensory and recognition capabilities has been a persistent pursuit for developing humanoid robotics. Here, an artificial mechano&#8208;optical synapse is reported to implement in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception. By employing mechanoluminescence (ML) material, direct conversion of the mechanical signals into light emission is achieved and the light is transported to an adjacent photostimulated luminescence (PSL) layer without pre&#8208; and post&#8208;irradiation. The PSL layer acts as a photon reservoir as well as a processing unit for achieving in&#8208;memory computing. The approach based on ML coupled with PSL material is different from traditional circuit&#8211;constrained methods, enabling remote operation and easy accessibility. Individual and synergistic plasticity are elaborately investigated under force and light pulses, including paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning behavior, and short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory. A multisensory neural network is built for processing the obtained handwritten patterns with a tablet consisting of the device, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 92.5%. Moreover, material identification has been explored based on visual&#8208;tactile sensing, with an accuracy rate of 98.6%. This work provides a promising strategy to construct in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is the first to propose that the surface reconstruction of a Weyl semimetal creates a Hermitian bulk&#8208;non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The non&#8208;Hermitian effects arising from the surface reconstruction are manifested by the emergence of non&#8208;topological surface Fermi arcs (NTSFAs) and the broadening of both topological surface Fermi arcs (SFAs) and NTSFAs. These effects are demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in a surface&#8208;reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non&#8208;Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non&#8208;Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non&#8208;Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress is hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of the surface&#8208;selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non&#8208;Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, surface&#8208;projected density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc (SFA) connectivity and generates new isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs (NTSFAs) by introducing non&#8208;Hermitian terms. The surface&#8208;selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk &#8211; non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition (OBC) for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non&#8208;Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non&#8208;Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. Furthermore, it provides important enlightenment for constructing topological photonic crystals with surface reconstruction and studying their topological&#160;properties.

         <title>Rolling the Dice with Light Competition: Introducing a True Random Number Generator Powered by Photo&#8208;Induced Polarity Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the ALTRNG, utilizing a BPPD to generate random bits via unpredictable&#160;arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 NIST tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams. With a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, it enables wireless random number transmission, offering potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The pursuit of hardware&#8208;based security solutions has highlighted the true random number generator (TRNG). Various physical phenomena, from noise generation to quantum physics complexities, have been explored for random number generation. The arc discharge light&#8208;induced TRNG (ALTRNG) is introduced, featuring wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent generation and arc discharge irradiation. A bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector (BPPD) differentiates &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221; states, producing highly random bits validated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 15 tests. The BPPD's response to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) and blue light enables distinct photocurrent generation under arc discharge illumination. The ALTRNG generates true random signals, yielding bit streams with unpredictability, uniform distribution, and stability. With a readout circuit achieving 2&#8208;kbps, wireless random number transmission is demonstrated, highlighting potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray image generation.

         <title>A Supramolecular Nanoengine Generates Nanomechanical Force on Demand for Precise Cytosolic Delivery of Anti&#8208;miRNAs and Synergistic TNBC Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carrier&#8208;free supramolecular nanoengine (AMGA) is developed, which significantly enhances the cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNAs without requiring light irradiation for precise targeting and synergistic chemo&#8208;gene therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. AMGA can specifically generate nanomechanical force to promote the endo/lysosome escape of anti&#8208;miRNAs, simultaneously downregulating miRNA&#8208;21 and miRNA&#8208;10b, and release the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine.








Abstract
Although anti&#8208;microRNA (miRNA) is capable of silencing target miRNA and regulating multiple mRNAs in diverse signaling pathways, RNA medicines still encounter numerous challenges, especially in terms of poor delivery, inefficient endo/lysosomal escape, and suboptimal treatment. Herein, we have developed a carrier&#8208;free supramolecular nanoengine, AMGA (anti&#8208;miRNA/GEM2&#8208;Azo), which significantly enhances the cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNA without requiring light irradiation, thereby facilitating precise targeting and synergistic chemo&#8208;gene therapy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). AMGA can be rapidly internalized by cancer cells and specifically generate nanomechanical force to promote the efficient escape of anti&#8208;miRNAs from the endo/lysosome to the cytoplasm, simultaneously downregulating miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;10b. In comparison to Lipofectamine 2000, AMGA demonstrated superior efficacy in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Significantly, AMGA exhibited profound antitumor and gene silencing effects in an orthotopic human TNBC mouse model. This novel supramolecular nanoengine presents a promising strategy for cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNAs.

         <title>Colossal Electromechanical Response in Antiferroelectric&#8208;based Nanoscale Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The careful design of interfaces in PbHfO3&#8208; and PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3&#8208;based multilayer heterostructures results in electromechanical strain &#8776;4.8% for films as thin as 120 nm. Such studies can significantly advance the understanding about electromechanically&#8208;active thin films which can surpass the detrimental effects of substrate&#8208;induced clamping to demonstrate strain values and be implemented in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The pursuit of smaller, energy&#8208;efficient devices drives the exploration of electromechanically active thin films (&lt;1 &#181;m) to enable micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the electromechanical response of such films is limited by substrate&#8208;induced mechanical clamping, large electromechanical responses in antiferroelectric and multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures have garnered interest. Here, multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures based on antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and ferroelectric PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 overcome substrate clamping to produce electromechanical strains &gt;4.5%. By varying the chemistry of the PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 layer (x = 0.3&#8208;0.6) it is possible to alter the threshold field for the antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric phase transition, reducing the field required to induce the onset of large electromechanical response. Furthermore, varying the interface density (from 0.008 to 3.1 nm&#8722;1) enhances the electrical&#8208;breakdown field by &gt;450%. Attaining the electromechanical strains does not necessitate creating a new material with unprecedented piezoelectric coefficients, but developing heterostructures capable of withstanding large fields, thus addressing traditional limitations of thin&#8208;film piezoelectrics.

Such studies can significantly advance the understanding about electromechanically-active thin films which can surpass the detrimental effects of substrate-induced clamping to demonstrate strain values and be implemented in real-world applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of smaller, energy-efficient devices drives the exploration of electromechanically active thin films (&amp;lt;1 &#181;m) to enable micro- and nano-electromechanical systems. While the electromechanical response of such films is limited by substrate-induced mechanical clamping, large electromechanical responses in antiferroelectric and multilayer thin-film heterostructures have garnered interest. Here, multilayer thin-film heterostructures based on antiferroelectric PbHfO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ferroelectric PbHf&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; overcome substrate clamping to produce electromechanical strains &amp;gt;4.5%. By varying the chemistry of the PbHf&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layer (x = 0.3-0.6) it is possible to alter the threshold field for the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition, reducing the field required to induce the onset of large electromechanical response. Furthermore, varying the interface density (from 0.008 to 3.1 nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) enhances the electrical-breakdown field by &amp;gt;450%. Attaining the electromechanical strains does not necessitate creating a new material with unprecedented piezoelectric coefficients, but developing heterostructures capable of withstanding large fields, thus addressing traditional limitations of thin-film piezoelectrics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing the Performance of Fluorinated Graphdiyne Moisture Cells via Hard Acid&#8208;Base Coordination of Aluminum Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a groundbreaking MEG method, highlighting the application of fluorinated graphdiyne in novel moisture cells. A unique Al ion&#8208;F coordination mechanism is introduced, significantly enhancing ion migration and conductivity. Coupled with the FGDY's macroporous structure, the FGDY Al&#8208;ion moisture cell achieves outstanding performance metrics.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;enabled electric generators (MEGs) are emerging as a transformative energy technology, capable of directly converting ambient moisture into electrical energy without producing pollutants or harmful emissions. However, the widespread application of MEGs is hindered by challenges such as intermittent output and low current densities, which limit power density and prevent large&#8208;scale integration. Here, a novel moisture cell based on Al ion&#8208;F coordination&#8212;specifically, a fluorinated graphdiyne (FGDY) Al&#8208;ion moisture cell (FGDY AlMC) is introduced. This new moisture cell achieves an exceptionally high mass&#8208;specific power density of 371.36&#160;&#181;W&#160;g&#8722;&#185;, stable output (0.65 V for 15 h), and broad applicability across varying humid environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the large&#8208;pore molecular structure of FGDY significantly reduces the diffusion barriers for Al ions compared to other 2D carbon materials. Furthermore, the F atoms as &#8220;hard base&#8221; on FGDY effectively coordinate with &#8220;hard acid&#8221; Al ions, enhancing ionic conductivity, accelerating ion migration, and promoting the generation of a higher number of mobile cations. These combined advantages lead to a marked improvement in the performance of the FGDY AlMC. These findings position Al ion coordinated FGDY as a highly promising candidate for the development of high&#8208;performance MEG active materials.

Engineered lipid vesicles, powered by enzyme&#8208;driven symmetry breaking and transient lipid ordering, demonstrate rotational and translational motion. This innovative approach presents exciting possibilities for biomedical applications, particularly in targeted drug delivery.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled lipid&#8208;based artificial cells that can achieve controlled rotation and directed translation present significant potential for biomedical applications, yet their engineering poses considerable challenges. Lipid vesicles synthesized via solution&#8208;based methods naturally adopt isotropic spherical shapes. Active motion of these spherical objects requires symmetry breaking and rigidity. In this study, giant vesicles are employed as chassis, utilizing enzymes that undergo cyclic, non&#8208;reciprocal conformational changes as power sources. Weak, transient protein&#8208;protein interactions induce lipid ordering leading to rigidity and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Upon activation of enzyme reactions, these spherical vesicles demonstrate a variety of motion patterns, from pure spinning to 3D spiral trajectories. From experiments and simulations, it is demonstrated how such motion enables the vesicles to cross complex barriers. By utilizing biocompatible and scalable materials, The methodology establishes a solid framework for the design of such self&#8208;propelled systems. The work paves the way for advancements in biomedical and environmental technologies such as targeted drug delivery and active matter research.

         <title>CuPt Alloy Enabling the Tandem Catalysis for Reduction of HCOOH and NO3&#8722; to Urea at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic liquid HCOOH and NO3&#8722; synthesis of urea with high Faraday efficiency at high current density is successfully achieved by synthesizing the Cu4Pt tandem catalyst loaded on copper foam. The doped Pt sites can enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form a large number of *CO key intermediates to lay the foundation for subsequent C&#9472;N coupling.








Abstract
The formation of urea by electrocatalytic reduction of C1&#8208;reactants and NO3&#8722; is an attractive way to store renewable electricity, close the carbon cycle, and eliminate nitrate contaminants from wastewater. Involving insufficient supply of C1 reactants and multiple electron transfers makes the reaction difficult to achieve high Faraday efficiency and high yield at high current density. Here, a urea synthesis approach is presented via electrocatalytic reductive coupling between liquid HCOOH and NO3&#8722; on copper foam (CF) loaded Cu4Pt catalyst with optimized ratios. A urea yield of 40.08 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved with FE up to 58.1% at a current density of &#8722;502.3 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to the productivity of previously reported catalysts. No degradation is observed over 120&#8208;h continuous operation at such a high yield rate. The highly efficient activity of Cu4Pt/CF can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Pt and Cu sites via tandem catalysis, in which the doped Pt sites enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form and adsorb large amounts of *CO key intermediates. The Cu sites can generate large quantities of the key intermediate *NH2. The Cu4Pt/CF adsorbed intermediates *CO and *NH2 are the basis for subsequent thermodynamic spontaneous C&#9472;N coupling.

         <title>An Opto&#8208;Iontronic Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Retina for Multimodal Circularly Polarized Neuromorphic Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An opto&#8208;iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (i&#8208;CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well&#8208;defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the i&#8208;CLC film enable it to detect CPL across a broad spectrum, with an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (gph = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&lt; 5&#160;V).








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is fundamental to phase&#8208;controlled imaging, quantum optics, and optical computing. Conventional CPL detection, relying on polarizers and quarter&#8208;wave plates, complicates device design and reduces sensitivity. Among emerging CPL detectors, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET) with helical organic semiconductors are highly promising due to their compact structures but suffer tedious synthesis, low dissymmetric factors (gph &lt;&#160;0.1), and high operating voltages (&gt; 50&#160;V). To address these issues, an opto&#8208;iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (i&#8208;CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well&#8208;defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the i&#8208;CLC film enable it to detect CPL with an excellent &#8220;handedness&#8221; selectivity across a broad spectrum. Moreover, its ionic nature provides a high capacitance (up to 580&#160;nF cm&#8722;2 @20&#160;Hz). The resulting flexible CPL detectors achieve an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (gph = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&lt; 5&#160;V), showcasing significant potential in optical communication and data encryption. Furthermore, leveraging high gph, they can perform in&#8208;sensor computing for highly accurate semantic segmentation using fused multimodal visual inputs (e.g., circularly polarized and ordinary light), achieving an accuracy of 75.73% and a mean intersection over the union of 0.3982, surpassing the performance of non&#8208;CPL photodetectors. Additionally, it optimizes power consumption by a factor of 102 compared to most conventional visual processing systems, offering a groundbreaking hardware solution for high&#8208;performance neuromorphic CPL vision.

To address these issues, an opto-iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well-defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-CLC film enable it to detect CPL with an excellent &#8220;handedness&#8221; selectivity across a broad spectrum. Moreover, its ionic nature provides a high capacitance (up to 580&#160;nF cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; @20&#160;Hz). The resulting flexible CPL detectors achieve an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&amp;lt; 5&#160;V), showcasing significant potential in optical communication and data encryption. Furthermore, leveraging high &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ph&lt;/sub&gt;, they can perform in-sensor computing for highly accurate semantic segmentation using fused multimodal visual inputs (e.g., circularly polarized and ordinary light), achieving an accuracy of 75.73% and a mean intersection over the union of 0.3982, surpassing the performance of non-CPL photodetectors. Additionally, it optimizes power consumption by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; compared to most conventional visual processing systems, offering a groundbreaking hardware solution for high-performance neuromorphic CPL vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Soft Nonpolar&#8208;Soluble Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite for General Construction of Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonpolar soluble 2D perovskite, noted as TPA2PbI4, is developed to construct controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions without solid reactions with the initial 3D perovskite films. This strategy improves both the performance of small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and large&#8208;area perovskite modules, promoting 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules to achieve a certified efficiency of 22.06%.








Abstract
Constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions through ion exchange between functional organic ammonium halides and the already&#8208;deposited bulk 3D perovskite films is a widely adopted strategy to effectively passivate and stabilize perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Such process poses challenges in precisely controlling the composition and distribution of the heterojunctions across the film, in particular for large&#8208;area applications. Here, a soft 2D perovskite based on tetrapheptyl&#8208;ammonium iodide (TPAI), noted as TPA2PbI4 is reported. It is the first&#8208;reported nonpolar readily soluble 2D perovskite, leading to highly compact and oriented perovskite layers. In addition, this nonpolar soluble TPA2PbI4 is beneficial to universally construct thickness&#8208;controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination and promote charge&#8208;carrier transfer on all the FA&#8208;, MA&#8208; and CsPbI3 PSCs. Such a unique strategy is also suitable for upscaling fabrication, demonstrated by 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules with a certified efficiency of 22.06%.

         <title>Mixed Electrolyte Enabling Ultrafast Mass Transport and Compatibility with Polypropylene Separator for Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed electrolyte (IL&#8208;FB (1:5)) for aluminum ion batteries is synthesized by incorporating fluorobenzene into ionic liquid electrolyte. The IL&#8208;FB (1:5) promotes mass transport, enabling cycling for 7500 h under high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also exhibits significantly improved wetting ability with the polypropylene separator, guaranteeing 60% reduction in the cost of the AIB.








Abstract
The energy industry has taken notice of aluminum ion batteries (AIB) for their low cost, high safety, and high capacity. However, using the ionic liquid electrolyte results in the uneven Al electrodeposition and the reliance on expensive glass fiber separators, due to the sluggish mass transport and low wettability for the polypropylene separator. Herein, a mixed electrolyte is introduced by incorporating the co&#8208;solvent fluorobenzene into the traditional AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid, in which the fluorobenzene (FB) mitigates electrostatic interactions between ions and facilitates the ion diffusion. The optimization principle for the mixed electrolyte is proposed based on maximizing the mass transportation, as indicated by the limiting current density. The optimized mixed electrolyte IL&#8208;FB (1:5) offers the highest limiting current density of 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, highly reversible plate/stripe of Al, and thus stable cycling for 7500 h with the high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also shows enhanced wettability for the polypropylene separator. The AIB with the polypropylene separator, exhibiting 60% decrease in cost, is achieved for the first time by using IL&#8208;FB (1:5), presenting a crucial step toward the initial practical application.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Hetero Double Junction Coupling Weakens Exciton Effects to Enhance Selective Photocatalytic O2 Activation on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the homo&#8208;hetero double&#8208;junction coupling strategy, the directional electron&#8211;hole migration is precisely regulated, and the exciton effect is substantially weakened. Under the strong built&#8208;in electric field, the FO/HCCN surface exhibits typical charge&#8208;carrier behavior, which achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2.








Abstract
Exciton effects caused by the inherent dielectric confinement in the 2D material carbon nitride (CN) severely limit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of free radicals. Herein, a homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy is reported to address these challenges. Ternary homojunction carbon nitride (HCCN) functionalized with cyano and cyanamide groups is constructed with a built&#8208;in electric field that efficiently separates the electron&#8211;hole into different structural units, thereby reducing reverse charge recombination and weakening exciton effects. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 (FO) subsequently constructs the homo&#8208;hetero double junction catalyst FO/HCCN with a built&#8208;in electric field 127 times stronger than HCCN, which promotes the directional migration of carriers after exciton dissociation and achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2. These results suggest that FO/HCCN achieves 99.6% removal of tetracycline within 20&#160;min, with a degradation rate 12 and 46 times higher than FO/CN and HCCN, respectively. In addition, the system shows excellent stability and cyclability in real&#8208;life light experiments and trace organic contaminant removal. This homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy opens up new avenues in weakening exciton effects and precisely controlling the generation of free radicals.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enabled by Solubility Control Toward 19% Organic Solar Cells via Compatible Air Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted guest acceptor BTP&#8208;4Cl is introduced to fine&#8208;tune the solubility of host components to address the excessive aggregation issue in blade&#8208;coated processing. It is found that the twisted molecular conformation profited in inducing longer intermolecular distance and dispersing molecular distribution in the solvent. Simultaneously, the guest acceptor positively influenced the crystalization kinetics by providing nuclei seeding sites. Finally, a fine phase separation is achieved in the open&#8208;air blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 19.67%.









Abstract
Blade coating is a promising tool for upscaling organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the performances of blade&#8208;coated OSCs still lag behind their spin&#8208;coated counterparts, limiting their competitive edge towards commercialization. One of the main reasons is that controlling the film aggregation kinetics and morphology becomes challenging during the transition from spin coating to blade coating, especially when using high boiling point solvents, which can result in excessive aggregation. Therefore, a deeper understanding and appraisal of film formation kinetics influenced by coating methods is crucial. In this work, it is demonstrated that ink solubility tuning by incorporating a twisted third component (BTP&#8208;4Cl) can induce rapid crystallization behavior and promote fine phase separation between the donor polymer (PM6) and the acceptor (BTP&#8208;eC9) in blade coating. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.67% is obtained in OSCs (0.04 cm2), one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies among the reported blade&#8208;coated OSCs (19.76% for the spin&#8208;coated devices). In addition, it is found that the inhibited phase aggregation contributes to enhancing the light stability of the device. This strategy offered novel insights into the effectiveness of solubility&#8208;tuning approaches for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs under open&#8208;air coating conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Blade coating is a promising tool for upscaling organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the performances of blade-coated OSCs still lag behind their spin-coated counterparts, limiting their competitive edge towards commercialization. One of the main reasons is that controlling the film aggregation kinetics and morphology becomes challenging during the transition from spin coating to blade coating, especially when using high boiling point solvents, which can result in excessive aggregation. Therefore, a deeper understanding and appraisal of film formation kinetics influenced by coating methods is crucial. In this work, it is demonstrated that ink solubility tuning by incorporating a twisted third component (BTP-4Cl) can induce rapid crystallization behavior and promote fine phase separation between the donor polymer (PM6) and the acceptor (BTP-eC9) in blade coating. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.67% is obtained in OSCs (0.04 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), one of the state-of-the-art efficiencies among the reported blade-coated OSCs (19.76% for the spin-coated devices). In addition, it is found that the inhibited phase aggregation contributes to enhancing the light stability of the device. This strategy offered novel insights into the effectiveness of solubility-tuning approaches for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs under open-air coating conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Development of Ternary Hydrogel Electrolytes for Superior Gel Thermocells: Exceptional Anti&#8208;Drying, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible wearable ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) by integrating a thermosensitive crystallizing agent, and supporting electrolyte into a natural nanocellulose hydrogel matrix is designed and constructed, which exhibits a remarkable thermopower, an optimized effective ionic conductivity, anti&#8208;drying, freezing resistance, and mechanical robustness. This work provides a versatile strategy for developing TGTC, contributing to advancements in low&#8208;grade energy harvesting and wearable electronics for the Internet of Things era.








Abstract
Gel thermocells (GTCs) provide a safe, facile, and scalable solution for harvesting waste heat to power ubiquitous electronics. However, achieving a harmonious integration of high power density, wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range stability, and mechanical robustness in GTCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, a novel ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) is proposed and fabricated by integrating ferro/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722;) redox couples, thermosensitive crystallizing agents guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), and supporting electrolytes lithium chloride (LiCl) into natural nanocellulose hydrogels to enhance overall performance. GdmCl selectively induces Fe(CN)64&#8722; crystallization, increasing the concentration difference of redox pairs, resulting in improving thermopower and significantly increased fiber friction, while LiCl rapidly balances charges through electromigration promoting efficient ion transport and reconstructing hydrogen bond networks, contributing to an excellent output power density and the capture of water molecules, which are further elucidated by simulations, achieving synchronous enhancement of anti&#8208;drying, anti&#8208;freezing and mechanical properties. Consequently, the TGTC achieves a remarkable thermopower of 3.42&#160;mV K&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 2.8&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, multiple continuous stable cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and an impressive strength of 3.06&#160;MPa. Notably, this study elucidates the design principles and underlying mechanisms of ternary gel electrolytes, offering a practical strategy for advancing GTC technology.

         <title>A Universal Solution for Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium Iron Phosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design criteria for a lithiation solution that enables spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions for the direct regeneration of spent LiFePO4 are proposed. Using machine learning (ML), the redox potentials of various solution systems are identified and revealed a critical relationship: the lower the redox potential, the more effective the lithiation of degraded LiFePO4 materials.








Abstract
Lithiation reactions driven by chemical potential offer a promising avenue for directly regenerating degraded lithium iron phosphate (LFP). However, the choice of solution system significantly influences the lithium supplementation where improper selection may result in poor lithium recovery or extremely slow kinetics. Herein, it is identified that the most critical factor affecting solution repair effectiveness is the redox potential of the anions in the solution, which determines whether spent LFP (SLFP) can undergo spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions. Then, machine learning (ML) is used for prediction and screening of huge potential solution systems, and finally a general strategy is proposed: creating a low redox potential solution system that incorporates anions with either low redox potential or moderate redox potential at high concentrations. As a demonstration, the regenerated LFP by ascorbic acid and LiOH solution systems exhibits a high discharge capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, retaining 96% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. This work establishes an important criteria for designing solution systems to restore degraded LFP, marking a significant advancement in the direct regeneration of cathode materials from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>17.68% Efficiency Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cell Modules Driven by Seed Crystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

The TOC illustration depicts asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O seed crystals (left) harnessing low nucleation barrier and strong crystallinity to facilitate PM6 crystallization. The module's J&#8211;V curve (right) highlights the transition from small&#8208;area cells to industrial&#8208;scale modules, emphasizing the seed crystal strategy's role in achieving uniform morphology and record efficiencies.








Abstract
Organic solar cells now surpass 20% efficiency in small&#8208;area devices, but the use of chloroform as a solvent poses industrial scalability challenges because of its limited ability of uniform film formation and toxicity. High&#8208;boiling, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are being studied as alternatives, but their low solubility and slow evaporation complicate crystallization process. Here, the study introduces a seed crystal strategy by incorporating oligo (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified small&#8208;molecule donors to optimize the nucleation and crystallization. The asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O molecule, which combines the strong crystallinity of rodanine group and the low nucleation barrier of oligo (ethylene glycol) chain, significantly promotes the crystallization of the polymer donor PM6. Moreover, BDTF&#8208;CA2O effectively suppresses excessive phase separation, and optimizes vertical distribution, resulting in enhanced exciton extraction, balanced carrier transport, and reduced recombination losses. Small&#8208;area toluene&#8208;processed devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%. In the realm of large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules, this strategy leads to a record active area efficiency of 17.68% and aperture area efficiency of 16.80% (certified at 16.26%), which is the highest reported for organic solar cell modules &gt;10 cm2 to date. These achievements highlight the potential of the seed crystal strategy for large&#8208;scale production of efficient, large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Breathable 2D Photothermal Fabric with Three&#8208;Layered Structure for Efficient Four&#8208;Plane Evaporation of Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by leaf structure and the transpiration process, a breathable 2D photothermal fabric with a three&#8208;layer structure for efficient four&#8208;plane evaporation of seawater is developed. The fabric evaporator achieves faster evaporation rates (2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2), outperforming single&#8208;plane (1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and double&#8208;plane (1.9 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) evaporations.








Abstract
2D photothermal membranes have demonstrated numerous advantages in solar desalination due to their flexibility, scalability, and low cost. However, their practical applications are limited by the restricted evaporation area and obstructed vapor channels. A biomimetic design of the breathable 2D photothermal fabric is reported, which is composed of two carbon&#8208;nanotube&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;coated polyester (PET) fabrics separated by fiber pillars, with the upper fabric layer having a hole array as stomatal channels. This fabric shows high solar&#8208;absorption efficiency (96.1%) and decreased water&#8208;evaporation enthalpy (1664.6 kJ kg&#8722;1). The hanging fabric as a heliotropic evaporator exhibits four&#8208;plane evaporation feature and achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2) illumination, better than the traditional floated model (single&#8208;plane, 1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). The evaporation rate can be further enhanced to 4.2 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 upon introducing adscititious airflow (2 m s&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the heliotropic&#8208;hanging design allows the dropping of concentrated brine, avoiding solid&#8208;salt&#8208;crystallization.

The hanging fabric as a heliotropic evaporator exhibits four-plane evaporation feature and achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under sunlight (1.0 kW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) illumination, better than the traditional floated model (single-plane, 1.6 kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The evaporation rate can be further enhanced to 4.2 kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; upon introducing adscititious airflow (2 m s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Simultaneously, the heliotropic-hanging design allows the dropping of concentrated brine, avoiding solid-salt-crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Interface Engineering by Helmholtz Plane Reconstructed Achieves Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic regulation strategy is proposed by introducing a small amount of Pyridine oxide (PNO). The preferentially adsorbed PNO constitutes a protective layer in the Inner Helmholtz Plane and inhibits the activity of water within the Outer Helmholtz plane via customizing solvation sheath. That's blocking the direct contact of active water and the anode, leading to highly reversible aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The rampant dendrite growth and notorious parasitic reactions significantly compromise the stability of zinc anodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries, presenting substantial for their practical applications. Herein, this work proposes a synergistic strategy that reconstructs the Helmholtz plane to precisely regulate the interface chemistry between the anode and the electrolyte. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that even a small amount of pyridine oxide (PNO) additive effectively alters the coordination environment and reorganizes the solvation sheath in the Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP). Simultaneously, PNO molecules preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface, displacing active water from the Inner Helmholtz Plane (IHP). Through synergistic regulation in both the OHP and IHP, zinc ions achieve compact and dense deposition along the Zn (002) crystal plane, while parasitic reactions catalyzed by active water are effectively suppressed. Consequently, the symmetric cell incorporating the PNO additive demonstrates stable cycling performance, maintaining more than 2300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and sustaining over 400&#160;h even at a high depth of discharge of 85%. Furthermore, the Zn||AQ cell retains 80% of its capacity after 3000 cycles and exhibits outstanding cycling stability even under the high active material mass loading (22&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) using the modified electrolyte.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer Aerogels with Increased Accessibility of Well&#8208;Defined Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites as a New Paradigm of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general strategy is developed to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (denoted as M&#8208;CCPA, M = Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) that can markedly increase the accessibility of their well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom metal sites within their hierarchically porous structures with mesopores and nanopores, which can provide a wide space for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts toward various energy&#8208;conversion systems.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum metal utilization efficiency is of significance, which presents enormous potentials to be extensively applied. It is desired yet challenging to elaborately tailor the coordination structures of active sites in SACs and simultaneously enable sufficient accessibility of these active sites to reactants. Here, a facile and general strategy to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (CCPA) with porous architectures that can markedly increase the accessibility of their elaborately&#8208;tailored active sites, which as a new electrocatalyst paradigm can fully present both the structural advantages of SACs and aerogel materials, is reported. Taking nickel (Ni) as an example, Ni&#8208;based CCPA (Ni&#8208;CCPA) and its counterpart Ni&#8208;CCP with non&#8208;aerogel feature are studied as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept case. Electrochemical measurements show that, relative to Ni&#8208;CCP, Ni&#8208;CCPA exhibits appreciably higher performance toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both the experimental results and theoretical simulations unravel that the improved OER performance of Ni&#8208;CCPA arises from the accelerated OH&#8722; diffusion within its porous architecture and enhanced OH&#8722; concentration near its highly exposed active sites at its high&#8208;curvature surfaces with localized electric fields. Importantly, as evidenced by the Cu&#8208;CCPA and Zn&#8208;CCPA examples, such strategy can be promisingly applied to prepare high&#8208;performance CCPA targeted toward various catalytic reactions and beyond.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Urea on High&#8208;Density Ga&#9472;Y Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst via Cross&#8208;Tuning</title>

Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide and nitrate into urea via the C&#8211;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#8211;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate is developed for urea electrosynthesis. Experiments and theories reveal that strong cross&#8208;synergizing coupling between Ga&#8208;Y sites contributed to improving the electrosynthesis performance of urea.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into urea via the C&#9472;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology, but it is still limited by poor yield rate, low Faradaic efficiency, and insufficient coupling kinetics. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#9472;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst is developed with loading up to 14.1 wt.% of Ga and Y supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Ga/Y&#8208;CNP) for urea electrosynthesis. The catalyst facilitates efficient C&#9472;N coupling through co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;, resulting in a high urea yield rate of 41.9 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 22.1% at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations&#160;reveal that the superior performance is attributed to the cross&#8208;tuning between adjacent pair Ga&#9472;Y sites, which can mutually optimize their electronic states for facilitating CO2 reduction to *CO at Ga sites and promoting NO3&#8722; conversion to hydroxylamine (*NH2OH) at Y sites, followed by spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NH2OH intermediates at Ga&#9472;Y sites to form C&#9472;N bonds. This work offers a pioneering strategy to manipulate C&#9472;N coupling pathways by cross&#8208;tuning active sites to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy 1T&#8208;Phase Quantum Sheets of Transition&#8208;Metal Disulfides</title>

         <dc:description>
An efficient high&#8208;entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in&#8208;plane ordered carbide laminates (i&#8208;MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high&#8208;strained high&#8208;entropy transition&#8208;metal disulfides with 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets during the exfoliation process. The resultant 1T&#8208;phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving good electrochemical properties in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. 








Abstract
Quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising nanomaterials owing to the combination of both 2D nanosheets and quantum dots with distinctive properties. However, the quantum sheets usually possess semiconducting behavior associated with 2H phase, it remains challenging to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets due to the easy sliding of the basal plane susceptible to the small lateral sizes. Here, an efficient high&#8208;entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in&#8208;plane ordered carbide laminates (i&#8208;MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high&#8208;entropy transition&#8208;metal disulfides with high strains and 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets with average size of 4.5 nm and thickness of 0.7 nm during the exfoliation process. Thus, the 1T&#8208;phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving a good rate performance of 744 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and a long cycle stability in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Quantum sheets of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising nanomaterials owing to the combination of both 2D nanosheets and quantum dots with distinctive properties. However, the quantum sheets usually possess semiconducting behavior associated with 2H phase, it remains challenging to produce 1T-phase quantum sheets due to the easy sliding of the basal plane susceptible to the small lateral sizes. Here, an efficient high-entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T-phase quantum sheets of transition-metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in-plane ordered carbide laminates (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;-MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high-entropy transition-metal disulfides with high strains and 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T-phase quantum sheets with average size of 4.5 nm and thickness of 0.7 nm during the exfoliation process. Thus, the 1T-phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving a good rate performance of 744 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 5 C and a long cycle stability in lithium-sulfur batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduction of Nonradiative Recombination at Perovskite/C60 Interface in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a bimolecular synergistic passivation strategy, it is feasible to achieve micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structural modulation of the perovskite surface, thereby passivating surface defects, regulating interface energy levels, and enhancing the interface electric field. This approach maximizes the reduction of nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface and demonstrates universal applicability across perovskite/C60 interfaces with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Although p&#8208;i&#8208;n type inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve excellent photoelectric efficiencies, the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface is still the key factor affecting the overall efficiency of p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. Herein, a synergistic passivation strategy (meta&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide and piperazine iodide) is developed to modify the perovskite/C60 interface in p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. This strategy facilitates in situ reconstruction of the perovskite film to obtain a smooth and flat perovskite surface. Furthermore, the two molecules work synergistically to passivate surface defects, adjust the interface energy levels, and bolster the interface electric field, all of which reduce the nonradiative recombination losses at the perovskite/C60 interface. The optimal PSCs adopting this strategy achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.85%. (certified value of 25.22%). After operating at the maximum power point for 1000 h, the 95% initial efficiency can be maintained. Furthermore, this process is universally applicable and scalable.

         <title>Minimizing Buried Interface Energy Losses with Post&#8208;Assembled Chelating Molecular Bridges for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chelating molecule (CB&#8208;PA) serves as both a top&#8208;interface molecular bridge and a void&#8208;filler to improve the buried interface quality and promote carrier extraction, leading to a high efficiency of 25.27% and superior stability for inverted MA&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole&#8208;collecting materials have made remarkable progress in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the incomplete coverage of SAMs and the non&#8208;intimate interface contact between perovskite/SAMs usually cause inferior interface characteristics and significant energy losses at the heterojunction interface. Herein, a post&#8208;assembled chelating molecular bridge strategy using 5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalicacid (CB&#8208;PA) is developed to modify the perovskite/SAMs buried interface. It is found that CB&#8208;PA can be chemically coupled with MeO&#8208;2PACz through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between carbazole groups, and chelate with perovskite by forming double C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb bonds, thus constructing a bridge&#8208;connected interface to promote carrier extraction. Simultaneously, the post&#8208;assembled CB&#8208;PA can fill the voids of MeO&#8208;2PACz to form dense hybrid SAMs, resulting in uniform surface potential and improved interface contact. Moreover, CB&#8208;PA treatment also tends to induce the oriented crystallization of perovskite films, passivate interface defects, and release lattice stress at the buried interface. Consequently, the CB&#8208;PA&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 25.27% with superior operational stability, retaining &#8776;94% of their initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking (65&#160;&#176;C) for 1000 h with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol. This work provides an innovative strategy to address the buried interface challenges for high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Self&#8208;Healable Passive Radiative Cooling Silicone Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the impact of crack damage on passive radiative cooling and introduces a self&#8208;healing, crack&#8208;resistant radiative cooling silicone/boron nitride compound, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack&#8208;resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This approach makes the material self&#8208;heal cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and can prevent further crack propagation under stress through crack blunting and deflection.








Abstract
Crack damage and expansion are prevalent issues in outdoor materials, which absorb or transmit sunlight to damaged areas, substantially impairing the functionality of passive radiative cooling systems. Herein, a silicone/dielectric radiative cooling compound is introduced that is both self&#8208;healing and crack&#8208;resistant, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack&#8208;resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This network incorporates boron nitride dielectrics, which serve as sunlight scatterers and hydrogen bond acceptors, with customized silicone polymer featuring high atmospheric window emissive chain segments and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR transparent hydrogen bond moieties. When cracks form, the polymer's chain mobility allows the hydrogen bond moieties in boron nitride and silicone to re&#8208;associate, realizing self&#8208;healing of cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and restoring cooling performance to &#8776;100%. The combination of rigid boron nitride and sacrificial hydrogen bonds in polymer also enhances the materials&#8217; fracture energy to 865%, effectively preventing further crack propagation under stress through autonomous crack blunting and deflection. These remarkable characteristics make this radiative cooling compound highly suited for increasingly complex, dynamic, and prolonged outdoor application environments.

         <title>Strong and Tough Water&#8208;Tolerant Conductive Eutectogels with Phase&#8208;Separated Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Dual Ionic Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eutectogel (PSDIC&#8208;gel) with exceptional integrative properties is successfully developed by blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, in which spontaneously forming dual ionic channels through in situ polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The transparent PSDIC&#8208;gel exhibits remarkable tensile strength, high toughness, excellent ionic conductivity, improved water tolerance, and rapid room temperature self&#8208;healing ability, thus, has wide application prospects in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Eutectogels are emerging as the next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics due to their superior ionic conductivity, non&#8208;volatility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, most eutectogels suffer from weak mechanical strength and toughness and pronounced hygroscopicity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to fabricate phase&#8208;separated eutectogels with dual ionic channels (PSDIC&#8208;gel), which exhibit exceptional integrative properties, especially water resistance. By blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, dual ionic channels spontaneously form via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) phase containing Li+&#8208;channels, rich in hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, provides mechanical strength and conductivity. The hydrophobic poly(hexafluorobutyl acrylate) (PHFBA) phase incorporating cholinium cation (Ch+) channels enhances toughness, conductivity, and water resistance. Adjusting the phase ratio yields a microphase&#8208;separated transparent eutectogel with high tensile strength (6.03&#160;MPa), toughness (16.18&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent ionic conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#160;m&#8722;1), strong substrate adhesion, and rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing. Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals the conductive mechanism and the phase&#8208;separated structure featuring dual ionic channels in PSDIC&#8208;gels, advancing the understanding of complex ionic interactions at the atomic level. The PSDIC&#8208;gel enables a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator for accurate real&#8208;time self&#8208;powered human motion sensing. This work advances eutectogel design through structure&#8208;property engineering, offering a universal strategy to reconcile mechanical robustness, environmental suitability, and ionic conductivity for wearable electronics.

         <title>Highly Bright Pure Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Circularly Polarized Organic Hyperafterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving highly bright and narrowband organic hyperafterglow by isolating conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. Efficient energy and chirality transfers afford multi&#8208;color hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of&#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39 nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770 ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of&#8776;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Pure room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) promises great advantages in both exciton utilization and lifetime manipulation over existing organic luminophores for a variety of emerging applications, but the low brightness, low efficiency, and low color purity constrain the afterglow luminescence significantly. Here, a promising approach to design highly bright, efficient, and narrowband pRTP with long&#8208;lifetime for organic hyperafterglow is proposed by isolating a conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized (CP) luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. It is shown that the aggregation of chiral P&#8208;containing binaphthyl promotes the generation of CP&#8208;pRTP and afterglow with high brightness up to &#8776;50&#160;cd m&#8722;2, while the simultaneous energy transfer and chirality transfer afford multi&#8208;color organic hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of &#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39&#160;nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770&#160;ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of &#8776;10&#8722;3. Also, excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, organic solvents, and aqueous solutions of strong acids and bases are observed. With these advantages, applications of chirality information encryption, afterglow grayscale imaging, and 3D high&#8208;resolution afterglow models are realized, promoting significantly the fundamental understandings on the modulation of organic afterglow brightness and construction of high&#8208;performance pRTP materials with advanced photophysical properties and applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Corrosion with Anionic Polarity Index for Stable and Fast Aqueous Batteries Even in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the water&#8208;induced corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, will have a very adverse impact on the lifespan and rate performance of aqueous batteries. Through theoretical simulation, a strategy of anionic polarity index is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water simultaneously, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolyte endowing batteries with the merits of safe operation, low&#8208;cost fabrication, and high ionic conductivity, water&#8208;induced corrosion, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, adversely affects lifespan and rate capability. There is still a lack of selection criteria for benchmarking corrosion behavior qualitatively. Through theoretical simulation, an anionic polarity index (API) tactic is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water concomitantly, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries (ZABs). As proof of concept, a low&#8208;cost zinc salt of 0.5 m zinc bis(4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulphonate) (Zn(HBS)2) with low&#8208;API anion is prioritized. Combined in situ spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that, even in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, the low&#8208;API anion reduces interfacial water in the inner Helmholtz plane, shielding the chemical water dissociation. Meanwhile, their entering into the solvation sheath of Zn2+ lowers the solvent&#8208;separated ion pair, suppressing the electrochemical corrosion. The elaborated API&#8208;screened zinc salt endows fast plating kinetics of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 (119.1 mV polarization), high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 1600 h, and prolonged lifespan over 5000 cycles for the Zn&#8208;V cell. The results provide new metrics that can benchmark the success of ZABs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering Modulates Lignin&#8208;Metal Supramolecular Framework to Construct Carbon&#8208;Coated CoRu Alloy for Effective Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts are synthesized via a Lignin&#8208;Metal supramolecular framework by molecular weight engineering. Lignin with low molecular weight formed graphitic carbon layers with high defect density, resulting in excellent activity but limited stability. While lignin with high molecular weight produced amorphous carbon layers that enhanced durability. In&#8208;situ Raman and DFT indicate that defect density controls electron transport and intermediate adsorption.








Abstract
To overcome the challenges of low catalytic activity and instability, a molecular weight engineering strategy coupled with oxidative ammonolysis is developed to synthesize CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts with distinct morphologies and properties from biorefinery lignin. This approach effectively modulates intrinsic active sites and exposes unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;oxygen structures, thereby tailoring the morphology and defect structure of the carbon layers in the catalysts. The as&#8208;synthesized CoRu alloy catalysts from lignin precursors with varying molecular weights are designated as CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOH, and CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual. CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, featuring a defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, exhibited exceptional overall water&#8208;splitting performance (1.48 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly surpassing Pt/C || Ru/C (1.58 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In contrast, CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual, with its amorphous carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, demonstrated remarkable stability (350 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), vastly outperforming Pt/C || Ru/C (6 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that the defect&#8208;rich carbon layers effectively adsorb *H intermediates, accelerating the catalytic process. This strong adsorption also induces carbon layer rearrangement, leading to its dissolution of the carbon layer and oxidation of CoRu metal particles. This strategy provides a universal method for biomass&#8208;derived catalysts, establishing a direct relationship between molecular weight, catalyst morphology, and electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Targeted High&#8208;Resolution 3D Imaging of Tumor Vasculatures at Different Stages Using Far&#8208;Red AIE Nanoparticles Compatible with Tissue Clearing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an imaging technology for precise mapping and analysis of lung tumor vasculature at different stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue optical clearing (TOC). The advanced imaging technique reveals significant insights into tumor vascular dynamics, offering valuable implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
The occurrence and progression of blood vessels plays a pivotal role in different stages of tumor development, while current imaging techniques exhibit limited sensitivity to capture the dynamic changes of vasculature at different tumor stages. This drawback hinders the comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment, thereby impeding the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies. Herein, a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging technology is developed for mapping and analyzing vasculatures at different tumor stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue clearing. The hyaluronic acid (HA) in HA@TANP specifically targets CD44 antigen of tumor vasculature, while the acrylic acid in HA@TANP is applied for temperature&#8208;induced polymerization to ensure the covalent attachment of AIE fluorophores. Additionally, tissue optical clearing technology boosts light penetration and imaging resolution in dense tumor tissues. This strategy allows for the quantitative analyses of vascular diameter, length, and straightness and their correlation with various responses to treatments. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of distinct tumor vascular stages, providing valuable insights for enhanced cancer diagnosis and therapies from a tumor vascular&#8208;targeted perspective.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Multicompartment Photonic Pigments: Unlocking Non&#8208;Iridescent Pure RGB Structural Colors for Versatile Chromatic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel class of multicompartment photonic pigments derived from vegetable oils, leveraging biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers to effectively mitigate Ostwald ripening in complex emulsion systems. Through the development of an innovative structural model, non&#8208;iridescent pure red hues are achieved in photonic glass, enabling unprecedented versatility in chromatic engineering via an RGB three&#8208;primary color mixing strategy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;iridescent photonic glass pigments of block copolymers show great potential for sustainable structural coloration. However, the ability to create accurate RGB color mixtures for real&#8208;world applications is limited by the prevalent use of non&#8208;degradable, fossil oil&#8208;derived components and the difficulty in achieving pure red hues. This work presents an alternative strategy for achieving more sustainable structural coloration by fabricating composite photonic pigments through controlled self&#8208;assembly of water, vegetable oil, and biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in a complex emulsion system. The obtained photonic balls feature unprecedented multicompartment structures characterized by a short&#8208;range ordered assembly of water nanodroplets stabilized by the BBCPs, along with oil droplets stabilized by these nanodroplets, which substantially enhances resistance to Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, a new structural model is introduced to eliminate disordered scattering, successfully creating a pure red structural color and overcoming a long&#8208;standing limitation in versatile chromatic engineering.

A novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, develope via a scalable solid&#8208;state approach, forms a distinctive 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Fe configuration that induces reverse hydrogen spillover and promotes proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction. The optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C with stable operation for 200 h.









Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction (P&#8208;ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid&#8208;state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single&#8208;atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P&#8208;ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single&#8208;atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.

         <title>Universal Prophylactic Antitumor Vaccination Using Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Induced pluripotent stem cell membrane is coated onto adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle cores to create a universal cancer vaccine. The formulation utilizes oncofetal antigens present on the cell membrane to elicit broadly protective immune responses in vivo. The enhanced immunity generated by the nanovaccine enables robust prophylactic efficacy against multiple murine tumor models.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines are a promising immunotherapeutic modality that function by training the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells. As tumor&#8208;specific and tumor&#8208;associated antigens generally cannot be identified until after a tumor has already been established, these vaccines must be applied therapeutically when strong immunosuppressive mechanisms are already in place. Building upon previous work using cell membrane coating nanotechnology, the development of a broad&#8208;spectrum prophylactic cancer nanovaccine that consists of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) membrane coated around an adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle core is shown. The resulting nanostructure is capable of presenting iPSC&#8208;derived oncofetal antigens, which are oftentimes re&#8208;expressed on cancer cells but lowly present on normal adult tissues. When administered in vivo, the iPSC membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are highly immunostimulatory and elicit strong antitumor immunity that can successfully inhibit the growth of multiple tumor types, including five different murine tumor models and in a bilaterial heterogeneous tumor model. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective approach for engineering iPSC&#8208;based nanovaccines that can be applied broadly to prevent cancer before it occurs.

         <title>Molecular Design of Dimeric Acceptor Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.78% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

By optimizing building blocks and linking modes, a dimeric acceptor, named DY&#8208;FL, is innovatively designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the efficient molecular design strategy, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs rendered an efficiency of 19.78%. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices showcased significantly enhanced photo/thermal stability in comparison to small molecule acceptor&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) with high efficiency and stability is highly desirable to facilitate its commercial applications. Although dimeric acceptors with distinctive advantages have been widely studied, high&#8208;performance binary OSCs based on such molecules have rarely been achieved. In this work, a new dimeric acceptor (DY&#8208;FL) is constructed by simultaneously optimizing the linking sites and units, as well as the building blocks. Thanks to the effective molecular design, DY&#8208;FL provides improved molecular stacking for fibrous morphology with favorable exciton/charge dynamics. Consequently, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs render a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78%, representing a record&#8208;breaking efficiency for binary OSCs based on dimeric acceptors. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices display significantly enhanced operational stability under external stimuli such as light and heat, in comparison to their small molecule acceptor (Y&#8208;F)&#8208;based counterpart. These findings highlight the significance of building blocks and linking modes, providing insight into the effective molecular design strategy of dimeric acceptors for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs.

         <title>Monomolecule Coupled to Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt phthalocyanine molecule&#8208;modified oxygen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst achieves superior oxygen reduction with two&#8208;electron selectivity of 99% and hydrogen peroxide yield of 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. The modulation of the electronic structure of active sites through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking&#8208;mediated oxygen doping optimizes the interaction between active sites and intermediate *OOH.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an ideal alternative for the industrial anthraquinone process because of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency, depending on the activity and selectivity of catalysts. Carbon&#8208;based materials possess prospects as candidate catalysts for the production of H2O2. Herein, cedar&#8208;derived monolithic carbon catalysts modified with coupling oxygen doping and phthalocyanine molecules are synthesized. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)&#160;molecules are introduced onto the carbon surface to construct monomolecular active sites via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The electronic structure of CoPc is modulated by oxygen doping on carbon substrates, mediated by monomolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. A synergistic effect optimally modulated the interaction between CoPc and key intermediate to H2O2. The energy barrier for oxygen reduction is reduced to optimize the selectivity to H2O2. CoPc@OCW provided up to 99% selectivity to H2O2 at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE. In a three&#8208;phase flow cell, CoPc@OCW achieved an H2O2 yield up to 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;V versus RHE with stable running for 24 h. The advantages of carbon&#8208;based catalysts including the adjustable chemical structure depending on &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electronic structure of carbon atoms through oxygen doping improved the catalytic performances in the production of H2O2.

&lt;p&gt;Cobalt phthalocyanine molecule-modified oxygen-doped carbon catalyst achieves superior oxygen reduction with two-electron selectivity of 99% and hydrogen peroxide yield of 10.4 mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The modulation of the electronic structure of active sites through &#960;-&#960; stacking-mediated oxygen doping optimizes the interaction between active sites and intermediate *OOH.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is an ideal alternative for the industrial anthraquinone process because of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency, depending on the activity and selectivity of catalysts. Carbon-based materials possess prospects as candidate catalysts for the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Herein, cedar-derived monolithic carbon catalysts modified with coupling oxygen doping and phthalocyanine molecules are synthesized. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)&#160;molecules are introduced onto the carbon surface to construct monomolecular active sites via &#960;-&#960; stacking. The electronic structure of CoPc is modulated by oxygen doping on carbon substrates, mediated by monomolecular &#960;-&#960; stacking. A synergistic effect optimally modulated the interaction between CoPc and key intermediate to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The energy barrier for oxygen reduction is reduced to optimize the selectivity to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. CoPc@OCW provided up to 99% selectivity to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE. In a three-phase flow cell, CoPc@OCW achieved an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield up to 10.4 mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.2&#160;V versus RHE with stable running for 24 h. The advantages of carbon-based catalysts including the adjustable chemical structure depending on &#960;-&#960; stacking and electronic structure of carbon atoms through oxygen doping improved the catalytic performances in the production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This proof-to-concept research demonstrates the potential application of carbon-based molecular catalysts for electrochemical synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Industrial&#8208;current Ammonia Synthesis by Polarized Cuprous Cyanamide Coupled to Valorization of Glycerol at 4,000 mA cm&#8722;2</title>

This work presents a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system featuring Cu2NCN as an efficient nitrate reduction (NO3RR) electrocatalyst, coupled with glycerol oxidation for low&#8208;voltage, industrial&#8208;level NH3 production. Achieving 4000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.52 V with sustained stability at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 over 100 h, the system offers 83% Faradaic efficiency, with theoretical insights on NO&#8323;* adsorption and O&#8211;N bond cleavage.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) holds significance in both NH3 synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation. However, achieving industrial&#8208;scale current and high stability in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer remains challenging due to inherent high full&#8208;cell voltage for sluggish NO3RR and water oxidation. Here, Cu2NCN with positive surface electrostatic potential VS(r) is applied as highly efficient NO3RR electrocatalysts to achieve industrial&#8208;current and low&#8208;voltage stable NH3 production in MEA electrolyzer with coupled anodic glycerol oxidation. This paired electro&#8208;refinery (PER) system reaches 4000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.52 V and remains stable at industrial&#8208;level 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 100 h with the NH3 production rate of 97000 &#181;gNH3 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 83%. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the asymmetric and electron&#8208;withdrawing [N&#8722;C&#8801;N] units enhance polarization and VS(r), promoting robust and asymmetric adsorption of NO3* on Cu2NCN to facilitate O&#8722;N bond dissociation. A comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis demonstrates the profitability and commercial viability of this coupled system. Our work opens a new avenue and marks a significant advancement in MEA systems for industrial NH3 synthesis.

         <title>Lithiophilic&#8208;Gradient, Li+ Supplementary Interphase Design for Lean Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High energy/power density batteries have become an urgent need for the electric vehicle and consumer electronics markets. In this work, Cheng et&#160;al. develop an lean lithium metal batteries (LLMB) prototype with lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design and self&#8208;supplementary Li sources for bare Cu foil. It provides a new perspective for the optimization strategy for next generation lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
The practicability of anode&#8208;less/free lithiummetal batteries (LMBs) is impeded by unregulated dendrite formation on thedeposition substrate. Herein, this study presents a lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design for the lean lithium metal battery (LLMB) model. Engineered via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry approach, the high entropy metalphosphide (HEMP) particles with tunable lithiophilic species are dispersedwithin reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Moreover, a poly (vinylidene fluoride co&#8208;hexafluoropropylenepolymer) (PVDF&#8208;HFP), blended with molten Li at the tailorable amounts, forms aLi supplementary top layer through a layer&#8208;transfer printing technique. Theintegrated layer (HEMP@RGO&#8208;MTL@PH) not only regulates the dendrite&#8208;free lithiumdeposition towards the Cu substrate up to 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, but also maintains robust cyclability of the symmetric cell at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even under 83% depth of discharge. As pairing the modified Cu foil with the LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (NCM811, 16.9 mg cm&#8722;2, double sided, N/P ratio of 0.21) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, achieves gravimetric energy densities of 414.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, power output of 977.1 W kg&#8722;1, as well as highly reversible phasic evolutionmonitored in operando. This gradient interfacial strategy can promotethe commercialization of energy/power&#8208;dense energy storage solutions.

This perspective provides a systematic discussion on the challenges and solutions in designing materials for intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs). It also highlights prospective challenges and offers insights into the development of highly efficient and stable ISOLEDs for practical applications.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require stretchable displays that can withstand large and repeated mechanical deformation without failure. Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) that operate under DC voltage provide promising candidates for wearable display applications. However, the lack of sophisticated stretchable materials and processing techniques suitable for ISOLEDs results in a significant deficit in the efficiency of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ISOLEDs compared to industrial standards. The design of stretchable conducting and semiconducting materials poses a significant challenge because of trade&#8208;off relationships between stretchability and properties such as conductivity and charge carrier mobility. To increase the efficiency of ISOLEDs to meet industrial standards, strategies to overcome these trade&#8208;offs must be developed. This perspective discusses recent progress and challenges in designing stretchable electrodes, light&#8208;emitting materials, transport materials, and potential applications of ISOLEDs. It&#160;provides a useful guide in this field to develop efficient ISOLEDs for system&#8208;level integration.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization
In article number 2420510, Walid A. Daoud and colleagues report an atomic&#8208;scale polarization&#8208;functionalized Mn3O4&#8208;based catalyst for vanadium redox flow battery, where the role of vacancy&#8208;induced local polarization on vanadium redox reactions is investigated. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes
This cross&#8208;sectional STEM image captures the wave&#8208;like rippling observed in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid 2D MXene. Here, these ripples, often referred to as Ripplocations, are formed when the organic surface groups are exposed to the electron beam. Ripplocations are a fundamental defect in layered materials and may play a key role in how the material responds to stress and external conditions. More details can be found in article number 2411669 by Francisco Lagunas, Robert F. Klie, and co&#8208;workers.

Coated Liquid Metal Droplets
In article number 2414519, Yixiong Feng. Jingyu Sun, Xiuju Song, and co&#8208;workers present a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated cadmium telluride (Cr2Te3)&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8208;LM) droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, non&#8208;adhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magneto&#8208;interactive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.

         <title>Pioneering the Future: Principles, Advances, and Challenges in Organic Electrodes for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium&#8208;ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost&#8208;effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+&#8208;ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting&#8208;edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium&#8208;ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids in AAIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium-ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost-effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic-inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting-edge aqueous energy storage systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous ammonium-ion (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next-generation large-scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost-effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, unlocking the NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high-performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting-edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium-ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic-inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic-material-based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting-edge aqueous energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Quantification for In Situ and Operando Liquid&#8208;Phase Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example,&#160;&#947;&#8208; or X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation&#8208;induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP&#8208;TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion&#8208;Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion&#8208;generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage&#8208;induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator&#8208;based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron&#8208;triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese&#8208;activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

         <title>Advanced 3D Food Printing with Simultaneous Cooking and Generative AI Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI&#8208;generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enhanced solution is developed to achieve extrusion&#8208;based printing with simultaneous infrared heating, enabling in&#8208;line and rapid cooking of complex starch&#8208;based food. Noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources present outstanding food quality control with microbial studies, microstructure analysis, and heat transfer simulation models. This integrative 3D food printing method with AI&#8208;enhanced food pattern generation and in&#8208;situ cooking significantly expands the applications for customized food creation. It paves the way for the broader adoption of heating&#8208;based 3D printing of functional materials.

Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell&#8208;laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin&#8208;based bioresins. Tomographic light&#8208;responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self&#8208;organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light&#8208;based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial&#8208;selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi&#8208;material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light&#8208;responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear&#8208;yielding behavior offers a new, single&#8208;component, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use suspension medium for in&#8208;bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi&#8208;color printer, complex multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Ripplocations in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high&#8208;energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h&#8208;MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (&#8776;100&#160;K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h&#8208;MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam&#8208;induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100&#160;K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxygenating PROTAC Microneedle for Spatiotemporally&#8208;Confined Protein Degradation and Enhanced Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oxygenating PROTAC microneedle (MN)&#160;is engineered to circumvent the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and achieve spatiotemporally&#8208;confined bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4) protein degradation. PPT7 NPs are swiftly released for rapid cellular uptake, confining the region of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ARV771 production upon 671 nm laser irradiation. BM NPs are continuously released for generating oxygen (O2) to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This PROTAC&#8208;delivered MN significantly inhibits&#160;tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models.









Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of primary brain tumors, which marginally respond&#160;to standard chemotherapy due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and the low tumor specificity of the therapeutics. Herein, a double&#8208;layered microneedle (MN) patch is rationally engineered by integrating acid and light dual&#8208;activatable PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) nanoparticles and self&#8208;oxygenating BSA&#8208;MnO2 (BM) nanoparticles for GBM treatment. The MN is administrated at the tumor site to locally deliver the PROTAC prodrug and BM nanoparticles. The PROTAC nanoparticles are rapidly released from the outer layer of the MN and specifically activated in the acidic intracellular environment of tumor cells. Subsequently, near&#8208;infrared light activates the photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through photodynamic therapy (PDT), thereby triggering spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable degradation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4). The BM nanoparticles, in the inner layer of the MN, serve as an oxygen supply station, and counteracts tumor hypoxia by converting hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) into oxygen (O2), thus promoting PDT and PROTAC activation. This PROTAC prodrug&#8208;integrated MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models. This study describes the first spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable protein degradation strategy for highly efficient GBM therapy, potentially advancing precise therapy of other kinds of refractory brain tumors.

         <title>Polyamine&#8208;Depleting Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Organic Frameworks Unleash Dendritic Cell and T Cell Vigor for Targeted CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) nanoplatforms depletes polyamines in the tumor microenvironment, reversing T&#8208;cell immunosuppression and enhancing dendritic cell activity. By releasing CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and inducing neoantigen generation via carbonyl stress and mutational burden elevation, this system enables precision cancer immunotherapy through dual&#8208;action mechanisms targeting both immune vigor and tumor vulnerability.








Abstract
Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic&#8208;assisted synthetic hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine&#8208;depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T&#8208;cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR&#8208;assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)&#8208;H2O2 reaction for CRET&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR&#8208;Cas9. Once released, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)&#8208;related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual&#8208;action strategy not only corrects T&#8208;cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Hyperspectral Metachip&#8208;Based 3D Spatial Map for Cancer Cell Screening and Quantification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record&#8208;high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high&#8208;dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes.

&lt;p&gt;A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record-high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high-dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320&#160;kHz&#160;cell&#160;mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This hyperspectral metachips are low-cost, highly compact, and label-free for fast, high-throughput and high-sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Nanoscale 3D Printing of Calcium Phosphates Using Bone Prenucleation Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bone&#8208;bioinspired photoresin containing PNCs of calcium phosphates, enabling nanoscale precision via 2pp. This novel approach allows for 2D patterning and 3D nanostructuring of CaPs with intricate geometries. The technique offers unparalleled control over scaffold design and porosity, paving the way for advanced applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are ubiquitous in biological structures, such as vertebrate bones and teeth, and have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two&#8208;photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of &#8776;300&#160;nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5&#160;nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light&#8208;scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate&#8208;based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage&#8208;tolerant materials, cell&#8208;modulating interfaces, and precision&#8208;engineered coatings.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Layered Functional Devices Using One Stamp with Programmable Surface Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8&#8208;inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a &#8220;one stamp, diverse patterns&#8221; printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions&#160;can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article designs and prepares a photo&#8208;responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn&#8208;CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug&#8208;delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood&#8208;nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc&#8208;citric acid organic metal framework (Zn&#8208;CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL&#8208;MMD&#8208;MAC)&#8208;RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

         <title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co&#8208;Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses ligand&#8208;based virtual screening&#160;(LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co&#8208;assembly ability.








Abstract
Co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co&#8208;assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand&#8208;based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co&#8208;assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co&#8208;assembly combinations that can directly co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG&#8208;L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG&#8208;L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) analysis revealed that the co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co&#8208;assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

         <title>Adhesives with Debonding&#8208;On&#8208;Demand Capability: Leveraging Responsive Microcapsules for Mechanically&#8208;Induced Debonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high&#8208;value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate&#8208;filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive. This simple and highly versatile approach lays the groundwork for advancing the development of more sustainable and functional adhesive materials.

         <title>Engineered MSCs Break Endothelial&#8208;Myofibroblast Crosstalk in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Reconstructing the Vascular Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineered MSCs (MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN) prepared based on surface&#8208;anchoring nanoparticle technology can trigger the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP&#8208;2) response to release drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MM@LPHN) and break the malignant regulatory network between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in the fibroblastic foci. Combined with the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect of MSCs achieve the reconstruction of the vascular niche, the engineered MSCs promote lung tissue regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.








Abstract
In the progress of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the normal vascular niche plays a crucial role in alveolar regeneration by secreting angiocrine factors. However, the malignant interaction between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells results in significant loss of pulmonary capillaries in fibroblast foci, which promotes continuous deterioration of fibrosis. Herein, an engineered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic named MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN is developed for reconstructing the vascular niche, which is formed by modifying the surface of MSC with ROS&#8208;responsive lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles encapsulating the metformin and macitentan. Due to the homing ability of MSC, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN can effectively target lung tissue, then induce myofibroblast dedifferentiation to reduce the secretion of cytokines that cause endothelial cell damage and preventing endothelial cells from turning into a fibrotic phenotype, leading to recovery of the vascular endothelial cells function. Combined with the role of MSC&#8208;secreted growth factors promoting angiogenesis, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN ultimately constructs normal vascular structure in the fibroblast area and reverses bleomycin&#8208;induced PF. The findings suggest targeting the cell network in the vascular niche can effectively treat PF, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Development of Bioorthogonally Degradable Tough Hydrogels Using Enamine N&#8208;Oxide Based Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducibly degradable enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are integrated into tough double network hydrogels, enabling rapid and bioorthogonal degradation by aqueous diboron solutions. These chemical reagent&#8208;responsive biomaterials maintain structural integrity during use while enabling rapid degradation when needed, making them ideal for applications in intraoral wound dressings. These findings highlight the potential of the enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinker in polymer and materials chemistry.








Abstract
Inducibly degradable polymers present new opportunities to integrate tough hydrogels into a wide range of biomaterials. Rapid and inducible degradation enables fast transition in material properties without sacrificing material integrity prior to removal. In pursuit of bioorthogonal chemical modalities that will enable inducible polymer degradation in biologically relevant environments, enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are developed for double network acrylamide&#8208;based polymer/alginate hydrogels. Bioorthogonal dissociation initiated by the application of aqueous diboron solution through several delivery mechanisms effectively lead to polymer degradation. Their degradation by aqueous B2(OH)4 solution results in a fracture energy half&#8208;life of &lt;10 min. The biocompatibility of the degradable hydrogels and B2(OH)4 reagent is assessed, and the removability of strongly adhered tough hydrogels on mice skin is evaluated. Thermoresponsive PNiPAAm/Alg hydrogels are fabricated and application of the hydrogels as a chemically inducible degradable intraoral wound dressing is demonstrated. It is demonstrated through in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies that diboron solution administered to mice by oral gavage is well tolerated. Successful integration of enamine N&#8208;oxides within the tough double network hydrogels as chemically degradable motifs demonstrates the applicability of enamine N&#8208;oxides in the realm of polymer chemistry and highlights the importance of chemically induced bioorthogonal dissociation reactions for materials science.

         <title>Red, Green and Blue Liquid&#8208;Film Lasers Based on Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution&#8208;processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution&#8208;processibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing &#8220;entropic ligands and solvent&#8221; to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid&#8208;state vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe&#8208;based and InP&#8208;based cQDs. Furthermore, by integrating the liquid&#8208;state VCSEL with a microfluidic channel, it is demonstrated that heat dissipation during intense excitation is pivotal for cQD lasing likely across various excitation modes&#8212;whether pulsed or continuous&#8208;wave, optically or electrically&#8208;pumped&#8212;and different media, including liquid and solid states. The research will lay the foundation for a new era of liquid&#8208;state cQD lasers for specific occasions, distinguished by their customizable and largely&#8208;variable wavelengths, compact form factors, diverse materials basis, and dependable performance.

         <title>Nanoporous Ag Microparticles with Tailorable and Noncontaminated Nanopores for SERS Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface-enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.

         <title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin&#8208;10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.

         <title>Lipoic Acid/Choline Ionic Liquid Enhanced Intratumoral Heat/Mass Transfer for Suppressing Thermo&#8208;Mediated Tumor Relapse and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid consisting of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) as a multifunctional thermal ablation sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA disrupts tumor matrix and modulates cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thus facilitating its heat/mass transfer in tumors. Meanwhile, LACH/PNA demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on hepatoma cells and is further intensified by thermal treatment.








Abstract
Thermal ablation (TA) is widely used for clinical treatment of various cancers. However, TA often struggles to efficiently kill tumor cells without injuring adjacent normal tissues/cells, leading to thermo&#8208;mediated tumor relapse and metastasis, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding residual tumor cells. In this study, a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid composed of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) is developed as a multifunctional TA sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA exhibits a high diffusion coefficient by disrupting the tumor matrix and modulating cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating heat and mass transfer in tumors. LACH/PNA demonstrates greater cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells than on normal hepatocytes with this effect further intensified by thermal treatment. These findings highlight LACH/PNA as a promising multifunctional sensitizer for clinical chemoablation&#8208;microwave ablation synergy.

         <title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

         <title>Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid&#8208;Based Archival File System for Random Accessible In Vivo DNA Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed&#8208;loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte&#8208;to&#8208;yottabyte&#8208;scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key&#8208;value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence&#8208;based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital&#8208;to&#8208;biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large&#8208;scale DNA databases.

         <title>M&#246;bius Solvation Structure for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low&#8208;temperature performance. Herein, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first&#8208;ever pioneered, forming the surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non&#8208;polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity&#8208;reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity&#8208;reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D&#8208;A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual&#8208;Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light&#8208;Coupled Low&#8208;Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor&#8211;acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full&#8208;spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based metal&#8208;air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal&#8208;air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar&#8208;coupled metal&#8208;air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low&#8208;temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering, it exploits a novel full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Zn/Na&#8208;air batteries (Zn&#8208;SWAB/Na&#8208;SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre&#8208;designed analogous [A1&#8208;D1]m&#8208;[A1&#8208;D2]n copolymers with gradient energy&#8208;levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal&#8208;free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated&#8208;sunlight produces remarkably&#8208;enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight&#8208;coupled PGH&#8208;enabled Zn&#8208;SWAB and Na&#8208;SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room&#8208;temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room&#8208;temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

         <title>Lab&#8208;in&#8208;Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>

The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems&#8208;targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA&#8208;NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non&#8208;invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP&#8208;PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non&#8208;covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol&#8208;yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

         <title>Thermal Processing Creates Water&#8208;Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of using chemical cross&#8211;linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water&#8208;stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for &gt;20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross&#8211;linking agents such as (3&#8208;glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water&#8208;stable by simply baking at high temperatures (&gt;150 &#176;C) for a short time (&#8776; 2 min). It is shown that heat&#8208;treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically&#8208;cross&#8211;linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for &gt;20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat&#8208;treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross&#8211;linkers, resulting in a 3&#215; increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

         <title>Generating Self&#8208;Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum&#8208;based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection&#8208;associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria&#8208;derived flagella is described to construct self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge&#8208;reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self&#8208;adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell and B&#8208;cell immune responses. In ovalbumin&#8208;overexpressing melanoma&#8208;bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin&#8208;carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella&#8208;based self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>2D Metastable&#8208;Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable&#8208;phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate&#8208;dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable&#8208;phase 2D edge&#8208;sharing oxide: six&#8208;hexagonal phase&#8208;hafnium oxide (Hex&#8208;HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M&#8208;HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex&#8208;HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex&#8208;HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex&#8208;HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable&#8208;phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

         <title>Friction Memory Ionogels With Hysteretic Sticky&#8208;Slippery Transition via Thermolocking the Metastable state</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the kinetic differences between the evolution of the condensed structure in the bulk and the adsorption of droplets on the surface, on&#8208;demand friction memory is achieved without persistent stimulus.








Abstract
Many biological organisms possess adaptive friction states and display hysteretic friction recovery, allowing them to achieve specific friction memory after environment change. However, current artificial materials have limitations in maintaining on&#8208;demand friction states upon withdrawal of external triggers due to their strong dependence on external stimulus. Here, thermally induced phase separation ionogels with friction memory are reported. The kinetic difference between the evolution of bulk condensed structure and the adsorption of surface droplets after removing external stimulus delayed the recovery of friction state transition from slippery to sticky, thus achieving responsive friction memory. In addition, the metastable intermediate state generated during phase separation could be locked through vitrification, resulting in three distinct friction states determined by the synergy of stiffness and surface properties, including sticky state (coefficient of friction of 1.8), medium state (0.3&#8211;0.5) and slippery state (0.03&#8211;0.07). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, smart devices with diverse surface friction performance are engineered to realize various functions, including recognition of thermal range for target objects, de&#8208;icing, and movement manipulation. These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.

         <title>Giant and Anisotropic Enhancement of Spin&#8208;Charge Conversion in Graphene&#8208;Based Quantum System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New magnetic Fe/Graphene/Pt double Rashba interface displays record spin&#8208;charge current interconversion efficiency at room temperature. The effect, which is anisotropic along the &#915;&#8208;K and &#915;&#8208;M directions, arises from the Direct and Inverse Edelstein mechanism in this new quantum epitaxial heterostructure.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34&#8208;fold increase in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin&#8208;pumping on&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad&#8208;hoc first&#8208;principles theory. The improvement in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D&#8208;thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional&#160;computing.

A grid&#8208;like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). It enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675 Wh kg&#8722;1 in KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid&#8208;like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as&#8208;fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in redox&#8208;active electrolyte (KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro&#8208;activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox&#8208;active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application&#8208;inspired cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

         <title>Self&#8208;Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient&#8208;Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self&#8208;manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non&#8208;invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in&#160;ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self&#8208;manipulating sodium ion gradient&#8208;based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig&#8208;EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non&#8208;invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig&#8208;EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig&#8208;EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+&#8208;ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig&#8208;EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury&#8208;associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig&#8208;EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

         <title>Bionic Olfactory Neuron with In&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing for Intelligent Gas Recognition</title>

A material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy integrates an OFET array with in&#8208;sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) array with in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs&#8212;among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e&#8208;noses.

         <title>Restrictive Heterointerfacial Delamination in Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics Using a Bifacial Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80&#160;cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD&#8208;L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD&#8208;L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 inhibits intracellular PD&#8208;L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage but also maximizing T&#8208;cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B&#8208;containing polymer that self&#8208;assembled with PD&#8208;L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD&#8208;L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD&#8208;L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T&#8208;cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

Moreover, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/siPD-L1 inhibits intracellular PD-L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT-induced DNA damage but also maximizing T-cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT-immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B-containing polymer that self-assembled with PD-L1 siRNA to form &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/siPD-L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT-immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD-L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD-L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T-cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT-induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B/siPD-L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well&#8208;ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl&#8208;binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high&#8208;affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of &#8776;140 and &#8776;40, respectively, while maintaining long&#8208;term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high&#8208;performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Rapid and Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self&#8208;Generated Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low&#8208;cost self&#8208;accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent&#8208;free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self&#8208;accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent&#8208;free, vacuum&#8208;free, and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self&#8208;accelerated synthesis is driven by the self&#8208;generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o&#8208;substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol&#8208;functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self&#8208;accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial&#8208;scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post&#8208;treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA&#8208;K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high&#8208;performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA&#8208;K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA&#8208;K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial&#8208;scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA&#8208;K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

         <title>Neural Network&#8208;Assisted End&#8208;to&#8208;End Design for Full Light Field Control of Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive system&#8208;level neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework of meta&#8208;optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non&#8208;orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing.








Abstract
Meta&#8208;optics, with unique light&#8208;matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi&#8208;parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano&#8208;structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high&#8208;performance full&#8208;light field control. Here, a neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework that facilitates global, gradient&#8208;based optimization of multifunctional meta&#8208;optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., &#8776;6 &#215; structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full&#8208;parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non&#8208;orthogonal polarizations (&gt;3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta&#8208;optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent optical technologies.

         <title>Diluted Ternary Heterojunctions to Suppress Charge Recombination for Organic Solar Cells with 21% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long&#8208;ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5&#8208;16:L8&#8208;BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8&#8208;BO and C5&#8208;16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of the diluted p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY&#8208;IT diluted)/L8&#8208;BO:C5&#8208;16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

         <title>Stochastically Broken Inversion Symmetry of Van der Waals Topological Insulator for Nanoscale Physically Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;step process, and low&#8208;temperature condition with back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy&#160;hysteresis mapping, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, top&#8208;view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force&#8208;distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size&#8208;controllable challenge&#8208;response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new&#8208;generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, high&#8208;temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on&#8208;demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr3Te4/WS2/Fe3GeTe2/WTe2 Magnetic Memory with Field&#8208;Free Switching and Low Power Consumption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance&#8208;area product by integrating chemically vapor&#8208;deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin&#8208;orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high&#8208;performance spintronics but also paves the way for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field&#8208;free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT&#8208;memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor&#8208;deposited two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non&#8208;volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance&#8208;area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low&#8208;power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti&#8208;parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT&#8208;memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT&#8208;memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT&#8208;memory with PMA field&#8208;free switching.

         <title>Interfacial &#960;&#8208;Electron Cloud Extension and Charge Transfer Between Preferable Single&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated MOFs and Graphene for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin&#8208;conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single&#8208;crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, the preparation of high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single&#8208;crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG&#8208;VHS and NiNsG&#8208;VHS) are achieved by ultrasound&#8208;assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third&#8208;order NLO polarizability of CuNsG&#8208;VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG&#8208;VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

Herein, the ultrathin Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTP)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single-crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant-assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG-VHS and NiNsG-VHS) are achieved by ultrasound-assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;-conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third-order NLO polarizability of CuNsG-VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near-infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG-VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode-locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high-order harmonic mode-locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rhodamine B&#8208;Derived Low&#8208;Toxicity Full&#8208;Color Carbon Dots with Wide Tunable High&#8208;Stable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703&#160;nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid&#8208;state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non&#8208;toxic, cost&#8208;effective, and highly&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full&#8208;color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B&#8208;CDs, G&#8208;CDs, Y&#8208;CDs, R&#8208;CDs, and NIR&#8208;CDs) fluorescence through cross&#8208;linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703&#160;nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Polarization Convolution Based on Ferroelectric&#8208;Reconfigurable Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in&#8208;sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire&#8208;induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two&#8208;order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization&#8208;based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in&#8208;sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in&#8208;sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric&#8208;reconfigurable polarization&#8208;sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in&#8208;sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non&#8208;volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road&#8208;scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

         <title>The Critical Role of Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization in Transition Metal Oxides on Vanadium&#8208;Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic&#8208;scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long&#8208;term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid&#8208;scale all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy&#8208;induced physicochemical properties on vanadium&#8208;redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic&#8208;scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest&#8208;coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V2+/V3+ couple and expedite its round&#8208;tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long&#8208;term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000&#8208;cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outclassing others. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in TMOEs, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

         <title>Regulating the Isomerization Geometry and Energy State of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal&#8208;free COF&#8208;based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3&#8208;substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (&#916;E), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#945; with 2,2&#8208;substitution, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#946;&#946; with 3,3&#8208;substitution, and Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with 2,3&#8208;substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

Based on this strategy, isomeric &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#945;&#945;&lt;/b&gt; with 2,2-substitution, &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#946;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with 3,3-substitution, and &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#945;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with 2,3-substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, &lt;b&gt;Py-COF-&#945;&#946;&lt;/b&gt; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half-wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal-free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non-uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic-carbon (thiophene &#946;-position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Etchless InSe Cavities Based on Bound States in the Continuum for Enhanced Exciton&#8208;Mediated Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An etchless bound&#8208;state&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton&#8208;exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off&#8208;cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (&#947;&#8208;InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton&#8208;photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton&#8208;exciton scattering process, which is not observable off&#8208;cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self&#8208;enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro&#8208;inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro&#8208;inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune&#8208;inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls&#8208;Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth&#8208;abundant widely&#8208;used non&#8208;reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls&#8208;assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely&#8208;used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide&#8208;anchored copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen&#8208;species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Gelatin Hydrogel Scaffold with Drug Loading Remodels the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Enhance Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength exceeding 10&#160;MPa is developed, combined with rapid photocross&#8208;linking capability. This hydrogel enables the fabrication of complex and precise scaffolds through 3D printing. When loaded with roxadustat, the scaffold facilitates sustained&#8208;release therapy, effectively remodeling inflammatory microenvironments. This approach presents a promising solution for the repair of osteoporotic bone defects.









Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10&#160;MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug&#8208;loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation&#8208;induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

         <title>Unravelling the Atomic Structure of a Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Assembled from Ruthenium Metalloligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure&#8208;properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium&#8208;MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light&#8208;driven processes mainly due to their ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure&#8208;properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2&#8242;,6,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff&#8208;base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Magnetointeractive Cr2Te3&#8208;Coated Liquid Metal Droplets for Flexible Memory Arrays and Wearable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8211;LM) droplets via a simple self&#8208;assembly process. The CT&#8211;LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost&#8208;effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT&#8211;LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single object with dual properties &#8211; degradable and non&#8208;degradable &#8211; is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi&#8208;material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi&#8208;material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi&#8208;material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties &#8211; typically hard versus soft &#8211; and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi&#8208;material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength&#8208;differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual&#8208;wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio&#8208;temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway&#8208;independent wavelength&#8208;orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi&#8208;wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths &#8211; each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction &#8211; are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi&#8208;material objects with degradable and non&#8208;degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site&#8208;specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946;1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load&#8208;bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk&#8208;based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual&#8208;gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects, the dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

         <title>Toward High&#8208;Performance, Flexible, Photo&#8208;Assisted All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Screening of Solid&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes Coupled with Photoelectrochemical Storage Cathodes</title>

Highly cycle&#8208;stable photo&#8208;assisted all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light&#8208;driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo&#8208;assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light&#8208;driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light&#8208;driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm&#8722;1). Meanwhile, energy&#8208;level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch&#8208;type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Acoustic Valley Filter, Valve, and Diverter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>

The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics. The implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Utilizing the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the long&#8208;desired valley devices, such as filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. The designed devices may serve as a basis for developing advanced valley&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley&#8208;polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley&#8208;polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.
