         <title>Ohmic&#8208;Contact&#8208;Gated Carbon Nanotube Transistors for High&#8208;Performance Analog Amplifiers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing demand for small&#8208;signal biological sensing applications requires improved low&#8208;power, high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed analog amplifiers. To achieve this goal, a novel ohmic&#8208;contact&#8208;gated transistor is introduced and demonstrated for solution&#8208;processed semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes. These devices achieve the highest reported combination of channel&#8208;width&#8208;normalized drive current and channel&#8208;length&#8208;normalized signal gain, resulting in analog amplifiers that are well&#8208;suited for biological and physiological signals.








Abstract
The growing demand for ubiquitous data collection has driven the development of sensing technologies with local data processing. As a result, solution&#8208;processed semiconductors are widely employed due to their compatibility with low&#8208;cost additive manufacturing on a wide range of substrates. However, to fully realize their potential in sensing applications, high&#8208;performance scalable analog amplifiers must be realized. Here, ohmic&#8208;contact&#8208;gated transistors (OCGTs) based on solution&#8208;processed semiconducting single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes are introduced to address this unmet need. This new device concept enables output current saturation in the short&#8208;channel limit without compromising output current drive. The resulting OCGTs are used in common&#8208;source amplifiers to achieve the highest width&#8208;normalized output current (&#8776;30 &#181;A &#181;m&#8211;1) and length&#8208;scaled signal gain (&#8776;230 &#181;m&#8211;1) to date for solution&#8208;processed semiconductors. The utility of these amplifiers for emerging sensing technologies is demonstrated by the amplification of complex millivolt&#8208;scale analog biological signals including the outputs of electromyography, photoplethysmogram, and accelerometer sensors. Since the OCGT design is compatible with other solution&#8208;processed semiconducting materials, this work establishes a general route to high&#8208;performance, solution&#8208;processed analog electronics.

         <title>Borophene via Micromechanical Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromechanical exfoliation of borophene and transfer to arbitrary substrates are experimentally demonstrated with molecular dynamics simulation providing further validation. While high&#8208;resolution electron imaging provides an atomistic glimpse of the crystallographic phases of borophene, Raman and XPS spectral data establishes its chemical phase purity. When heterolayered with gold, borophene exhibits SERS&#8208;based molecular sensing. Borophene&#8208;based heterolayered excitonic devices are thus demonstrated.








Abstract
Borophene, the lightest among all Xenes, possesses extreme electronic mobility along with high carrier density and high Young's modulus. To accomplish device&#8208;quality borophene, novel approaches of realization of monolayers need to be urgently explored. In this work, micromechanical exfoliation is discovered to result in mono&#8208; and few&#8208;layered borophene of device quality. Borophene sheets are successfully fabricated down to monolayer thickness. Distinct crystallographic phases of borophene viz. XRD study reveals crystallographic phase transition from rhombohedral to several other eigen phases of borophene. The role of the destination substrates is held crucial in determining the final phase of the transferred sheet. The exfoliation energy is calculated by density functional theory. Molecular dynamics simulations are used to simulate the exfoliation process. Heterolayers of borophene, with black phosphorene (BP) or with molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) atomic sheets, are found to result in photoexcited coupling quantum states. Gold&#8208;coated borophene bestows promising anchoring capability for surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Successful demonstration of the electronic behavior of micromechanically exfoliated borophene and excitonic behavior of borophene&#8208;based heterolayers will guide future generation devices not only in electronics and excitonics, but also in thermal management, electronic packaging, hydrogen storage, hybrid energy storage, and clean energy solutions.

         <title>A Mobile and Self&#8208;Powered Micro&#8208;Flow Pump Based on Triboelectricity Driven Electroosmosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the unique output characteristics of the triboelectric nanogenerator, a mobile and motion&#8208;controlled triboelectric electroosmotic pump (TEOP) is proposed with much higher micro&#8208;flow generation efficiency compared to commercial high&#8208;voltage sources. This TEOP can produce a controllable micro&#8208;flow by mechanical movements and may contribute a more conducive option to achieve wider applications in motion&#8208;activated micro/nanofluidic transportation and manipulation.








Abstract
Electroosmotic pumps have been widely used in microfluidic systems. However, traditional high&#8208;voltage (HV)&#8208;sources are bulky in size and induce numerous accessional reactions, which largely reduce the system's portability and efficiency. Herein, a motion&#8208;controlled, highly efficient micro&#8208;flow pump based on triboelectricity driven electroosmosis is reported. Utilizing the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a strong electric field can be formed between two electrodes in the microfluidic channel with an electric double layer, thus driving the controllable electroosmotic flow by biomechanical movements. The performance and operation mechanism of this triboelectric electroosmotic pump (TEOP) is systematically studied and analyzed using a basic free&#8208;standing mode TENG. The TEOP produces &#8776;600 nL min&#8722;1 micro&#8208;flow with a Joule heat down to 1.76 J cm&#8722;3 nL&#8722;1 compared with &#8776;50 nL min&#8722;1 and 8.12 J cm&#8722;3 nL&#8722;1 for an HV&#8208;source. The advantages of economy, efficiency, portability, and safety render the TEOP a more conducive option to achieve wider applications in motion&#8208;activated micro/nanofluidic transportation and manipulation.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Cathode Materials for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Structural Design and Electrochemical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention due to their obvious advantage regarding the potassium reserves. Cathode materials, which determine the energy density of PIBs, usually suffer from serious structural deformation during continuous K+ (de)intercalation. Therefore, proper structural&#8208;design principles of cathode materials should be focused on to ensure high performance to promote the further development of PIBs.








Abstract
Due to the obvious advantage in potassium reserves, potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention as an alternative energy storage system for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the large size of K+ makes it a challenging task to identify suitable electrode materials, particularly cathode ones that determine the energy density of PIBs, capable of tolerating the serious structural deformation during the continuous intercalation/deintercalation of K+. It is therefore of paramount importance that proper design principles of cathode materials be followed to ensure stable electrochemical performance if a practical application of PIBs is expected. Herein, the current knowledge on the structural engineering of cathode materials acquired during the battle against its performance degradation is summarized.

     alt="High-Performance Cathode Materials for Potassium-Ion Batteries: Structural Design and Electrochemical Properties"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention due to their obvious advantage regarding the potassium reserves. Cathode materials, which determine the energy density of PIBs, usually suffer from serious structural deformation during continuous K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (de)intercalation. Therefore, proper structural-design principles of cathode materials should be focused on to ensure high performance to promote the further development of PIBs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the obvious advantage in potassium reserves, potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) are now receiving increasing research attention as an alternative energy storage system for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Unfortunately, the large size of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; makes it a challenging task to identify suitable electrode materials, particularly cathode ones that determine the energy density of PIBs, capable of tolerating the serious structural deformation during the continuous intercalation/deintercalation of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. It is therefore of paramount importance that proper design principles of cathode materials be followed to ensure stable electrochemical performance if a practical application of PIBs is expected. Herein, the current knowledge on the structural engineering of cathode materials acquired during the battle against its performance degradation is summarized. The K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; storage behavior of different types of cathodes is discussed in detail and the structure&#8211;performance relationship of materials sensitive to their different lattice frameworks is highlighted. The key issues facing the future development of different categories of cathode materials are also highlighted and perspectives for potential approaches and strategies to promote the further development of PIBs are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Noninvasive Gut&#8208;to&#8208;Brain Oral Drug Delivery System for Treating Brain Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Following oral administration, the prodrug transpasses the intestinal epithelial barrier via M cells, and then undergoes endocytosis by resident macrophages. The macrophage&#8208;hitchhiked prodrug is transported to the circulatory system via the lymphatic system, crossing the blood&#8211;brain barrier, ultimately penetrating the brain tumor. The tumor&#8208;overexpressed glutathione cleaves the disulfide bond within the prodrug, releasing the active drug, facilitating antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Most orally administered drugs fail to reach the intracerebral regions because of the intestinal epithelial barrier (IEB) and the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which are located between the gut and the brain. Herein, an oral prodrug delivery system that can overcome both the IEB and the BBB noninvasively is developed for treating gliomas. The prodrug is prepared by conjugating an anticancer drug on &#946;&#8208;glucans using a disulfide&#8208;containing linker. Following oral administration in glioma&#8208;bearing mice, the as&#8208;prepared prodrug can specifically target intestinal M cells, transpass the IEB, and be phagocytosed/hitchhiked by local macrophages (M&#981;). The M&#981;&#8208;hitchhiked prodrug is transported to the circulatory system via the lymphatic system, crossing the BBB. The tumor&#8208;overexpressed glutathione then cleaves the disulfide bond within the prodrug, releasing the active drug, improving its therapeutic efficacy. These findings reveal that the developed prodrug may serve as a gut&#8208;to&#8208;brain oral drug delivery platform for the well&#8208;targeted treatment of gliomas.

         <title>Mechanosensation Mediates Long&#8208;Range Spatial Decision&#8208;Making in an Aneural Organism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physarum polycephalum, a unicellular slime mold, is an important model for research into the physical basis of primitive cognition. In an arena containing 3 or 1 inert glass disks, it reliably chooses to grow outward toward the 3 disks. Computational modeling shows how Physarum exploits material properties to extract information about its environment that guides its morphogenesis and behavior.








Abstract
The unicellular protist Physarum polycephalum is an important emerging model for understanding how aneural organisms process information toward adaptive behavior. Here, it is revealed that Physarum can use mechanosensation to reliably make decisions about distant objects in its environment, preferentially growing in the direction of heavier, substrate&#8208;deforming, but chemically inert masses. This long&#8208;range sensing is abolished by gentle rhythmic mechanical disruption, changing substrate stiffness, or the addition of an inhibitor of mechanosensitive transient receptor potential channels. Additionally, it is demonstrated that Physarum does not respond to the absolute magnitude of strain. Computational modeling reveales that Physarum may perform this calculation by sensing the fraction of its perimeter that is distorted above a threshold substrate strain&#8212;a fundamentally novel method of mechanosensation. Using its body as both a distributed sensor array and computational substrate, this aneural organism leverages its unique morphology to make long&#8208;range decisions. Together, these data identify a surprising behavioral preference relying on biomechanical features and quantitatively characterize how the Physarum exploits physics to adaptively regulate its growth and shape.

         <title>Highly Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Rubidium and Chlorine Alloyed Metal Halide Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with external quantum efficiency reaching 10.1% and maximum luminance of 14&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 are realized by simultaneous incorporation of Rb+ and Cl&#8722; ions and long&#8208;chain ligands into CsPbBr3. The compositional engineering promotes the formation of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with wide bandgap, and results in sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;sized particles on the film surface that enhance the light outcoupling.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are promising candidates for display and solid&#8208;state lighting, due to their tunable colors, high conversion efficiencies, and low cost. However, the performance of blue PeLEDs is far inferior to that of the near&#8208;infrared, red, and green counterparts. Here, the fabrication of pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with an emission peak at 475&#160;nm, a peak external quantum efficiency of 10.1%, and a maximum luminance of 14&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 is demonstrated by tailoring the compositions of perovskites. The pure&#8208;blue electroluminescence is achieved by simultaneous addition of rubidium and chlorine ions into CsPbBr3 and incorporation of phenylethylammonium chloride forms quasi&#8208;2D hybrid perovskites. The combination of these composition engineering results in blueshifted emissions without reducing the quantum yield. The judicious alloying is shown to be critical to result in the better morphology with suppressed current leakage and enhanced light outcoupling.

         <title>A COF&#8208;Like N&#8208;Rich Conjugated Microporous Polytriphenylamine Cathode with Pseudocapacitive Anion Storage Behavior for High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Zinc Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;like poriferous polytriphenylamine conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) cathode with a pseudocapacitive anion storage behavior is demonstrated for aqueous zinc dual&#8208;ion batteries. The as&#8208;fabricated electrode displays both high active&#8208;site utilization efficacy (83.2% at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and good cycling stability (87.6% capacity retention at 1000 cycles).








Abstract
Conducting polymers with good electron conductivity and rich redox functional groups are promising cathode candidates for constructing high&#8208;energy aqueous zinc batteries. However, the glaring flaw of active&#8208;site underutilization impairs their electrochemical performance. Herein, we&#160;report a poriferous polytriphenylamine conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) cathode capable of accommodating Cl&#8722; anions in a pseudocapative&#8208;dominated manner for energy storage. Its specific 3D, covalent&#8208;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;like conjugated network ensures high accessibility efficacy of N active sites (up to 83.2% at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and distinct physicochemical stability (87.6% capacity retention after 1000 cycles) during repeated charging/discharging courses. Such a robust CMP electrode also leads to a zinc dual&#8208;ion battery device with a high energy density of 236 W h kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 6.8&#160;kW kg&#8722;1, substantially surpassing most recently reported organic&#8208;based zinc batteries. This study paves the way for the rational design of advanced CMP&#8208;based organic cathodes for high&#8208;energy devices.

         <dc:description>
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials by structure&#8208;retaining delignification show excellent mechanical properties and facilitate the embedding of advanced functionality. To pave the way for a multitude of applications and substitute less ecofriendly materials, future research needs to focus on a deeper understanding of the impact of the various processing steps and the resulting structure&#8211;property relationships.








Abstract
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials obtained by structure&#8208;retaining delignification are attracting increasing attention due to their excellent mechanical properties and great potential to serve as renewable and CO2 storing cellulose scaffolds for advanced hybrid materials with embedded functionality. Various delignification protocols and a multitude of further processing steps including polymer impregnation and densification are applied resulting in a large range of properties. However, treatment optimization requires a more comprehensive characterization of the developed materials in terms of structure, chemical composition, and mechanical properties for faster progress in the field. Herein, the current protocols for structure&#8208;retaining delignification are reviewed and the emphasis is placed on the mechanical characterization at different hierarchical levels of the cellulose scaffolds by experiments and modeling to reveal the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships.

Top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up wood&#8208;based structures provide a hierarchically porous, fibrous material platform for ion transport and regulation through multiscale channels. Through structural and compositional engineering, the ion transport behavior in wood&#8208;based structures can be regulated toward various emerging device applications.








Abstract
Ion transport and regulation are fundamental processes for various devices and applications related to energy storage and conversion, environmental remediation, sensing, ionotronics, and biotechnology. Wood&#8208;based materials, fabricated by top&#8208;down or bottom&#8208;up approaches, possess a unique hierarchically porous fibrous structure that offers an appealing material platform for multiscale ion regulation. The ion transport behavior in these materials can be regulated through structural and compositional engineering from the macroscale down to the nanoscale, imparting wood&#8208;based materials with multiple functions for a range of emerging applications. A fundamental understanding of ion transport behavior in wood&#8208;based structures enhances the capability to design high&#8208;performance ion&#8208;regulating devices and promotes the utilization of sustainable wood materials. Combining this unique ion regulation capability with the renewable and cost&#8208;effective raw materials available, wood and its derivatives are the natural choice of materials toward sustainability.

         <title>Beyond What Meets the Eye: Imaging and Imagining Wood Mechanical&#8211;Structural Properties</title>

A review of the imaging of wood at various length scales is presented, showing how hierarchical properties are achieved and demonstrating unique levels of physical and mechanical performance.








Abstract
Wood presents a hierarchical structure, containing features at all length scales: from the tracheids or vessels that make up its cellular structure, through to the microfibrils within the cell walls, down to the molecular architecture of the cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses that comprise its chemical makeup. This structure renders it with high mechanical (e.g., modulus and strength) and interesting physical (e.g., optical) properties. A better understanding of this structure, and how it plays a role in governing mechanical and other physical parameters, will help to better exploit this sustainable resource. Here, recent developments on the use of advanced imaging techniques for studying the structural properties of wood in relation to its mechanical properties are explored. The focus is on synchrotron nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray tomographical imaging, Raman and infrared spectroscopies, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Critical discussion on the role of imaging techniques and how fields are developing rapidly to incorporate both spatial and temporal ranges of analysis is presented.

         <title>Nanocellulose in Emulsions and Heterogeneous Water&#8208;Based Polymer Systems: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsions and latexes. The use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymer systems is reported. Comprehensive tables with past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives are presented, and properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses (i.e., bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals, and cellulose nanofibrils) are cellulose&#8208;based materials with at least one dimension in the nanoscale. These materials have unique and useful properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsion and latex systems. Herein, the use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymers is reviewed, including dispersion, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. Comprehensive tables describe past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives and the properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted. Even at low loadings, nanocellulose offers an unprecedented level of control as a property modifier for a range of emulsion and polymer applications, influencing, for example, emulsion type, stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. Nanocellulose can tune polymer particle properties such as size, surface charge, and morphology, or be used to produce capsules and polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and adhesive properties. The role of nanocellulose is discussed, and a perspective for future direction is presented.

         <title>Surface and Interface Engineering for Nanocellulosic Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses, the natural reinforcement for plants, are incredibly strong and stiff, and are therefore under great scrutiny for incorporation in sustainable, ecofriendly, and strong man&#8208;made materials. Nanocelluloses enable dramatic tailoring of surface chemistry, interface interactions, and functionalities via chemical and/or physical surface and interface engineering that permit assembly of diverse nanocellulosic materials. Some of the promising progress in this area is reviewed.








Abstract
How do trees support their upright massive bodies? The support comes from the incredibly strong and stiff, and highly crystalline nanoscale fibrils of extended cellulose chains, called cellulose nanofibers. Cellulose nanofibers and their crystalline parts&#8212;cellulose nanocrystals, collectively nanocelluloses, are therefore the recent hot materials to incorporate in man&#8208;made sustainable, environmentally sound, and mechanically strong materials. Nanocelluloses are generally obtained through a top&#8208;down process, during or after which the original surface chemistry and interface interactions can be dramatically changed. Therefore, surface and interface engineering are extremely important when nanocellulosic materials with a bottom&#8208;up process are fabricated. Herein, the main focus is on promising chemical modification and nonmodification approaches, aiming to prospect this hot topic from novel aspects, including nanocellulose&#8208;, chemistry&#8208;, and process&#8208;oriented surface and interface engineering for advanced nanocellulosic materials. The reinforcement of nanocelluloses in some functional materials, such as structural materials, films, filaments, aerogels, and foams, is discussed, relating to tailored surface and/or interface engineering. Although some of the nanocellulosic products have already reached the industrial arena, it is hoped that more and more nanocellulose&#8208;based products will become available in everyday life in the next few years.

         <title>Recent Progress in High&#8208;Strength and Robust Regenerated Cellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rengenerated cellulose materials with the forms of films/membranes, fibers, hydrogels, aerogels, beads/microspheres can be designed via chemical crosslinking, chemically dual&#8208;crosslinking, physical crosslinking, and chemically and physically double crosslinking for achieving the high strength and bidegradability. These cellulose&#8208;based materials are a promising substitute for nonbiodegradable petroleum&#8208;derived synthetic polymers, contribut ing to a sustainable development in the world.








Abstract
High&#8208;strength petroleum&#8208;based materials like plastics have been widely used in various fields, but their nonbiodegradability has caused serious pollution problems. Cellulose, as the most abundant sustainable polymer, has a great chance to act as the ideal substitute for plastics due to its low cost, wide availability, biodegradability, etc. Herein, the recent achievements for developing cellulose &#8220;green&#8221; solvents and regenerated cellulose materials with high strength via the &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; route are presented. Cellulose can be regenerated to produce films/membranes, hydrogels/aerogels, filaments/fibers, microspheres/beads, bioplastics, etc., which show potential applications in textiles, biomedicine, energy storage, packaging, etc. Importantly, these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be biodegraded in soil and oceans, reducing environmental pollution. The cellulose solvents, dissolving mechanism, and strategies for constructing the regenerated cellulose functional materials with high strength and performances, together with the current achievements and urgent challenges are summarized, and some perspectives are also proposed. The near future will be an exciting era for high&#8208;strength biodegradable and renewable materials. The hope is that many environmentally friendly materials with good properties and low cost will be produced for commercial use, which will be beneficial for sustainable development in the world.

         <title>The Use of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Self&#8208;Assembly and Nanocellulose to Prepare Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current literature on the use of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembled structures of nanocelluloses and oppositely charged polyelectrolytes for the preparation of strong, adhesive, electrically interactive, and biologically interactive thin films is summarized. By using this renewable and biodegradable nanomaterial, it is shown possible to prepare high&#8208;performance materials in a noncomplicated way.








Abstract
The current knowledge about the formation of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) self&#8208;assemblies using combinations of nanocelluloses (NCs) and polyelectrolytes is reviewed. Herein, the fundamentals behind the LbL formation, with a major focus on NCs, are considered. Following this, a special description of the limiting factors for the formation of LbLs of only NCs, both anionic and cationic, and the combination&#160;of NCs and polyelectrolytes/nanoparticles is provided. The ability of the NCs and polyelectrolytes to form dense films with excellent mechanical properties and with tailored optical properties is then reviewed. How low&#8208;density, wet stable&#160;networks of cellulose nanofibrils can be used as substrates for the preparation of antibacterial, electrically interactive, and fire&#8208;retardant materials by forming well&#8208;defined LbLs inside these networks is then considered. A short outlook of the possible uses of LbLs containing NCs is given to conclude.

         <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Functional Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood components are considered as important feedstocks to fabricate functional materials. An insightful summary of recent wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials is provided from the perspective of macromolecular engineering, including the structural characteristics of cellulose and lignin, molecular modification, and subsequent assembly behavior to generate distinctive functional materials.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials due to their distinctive properties, including environmental friendliness, renewability, and biodegradability. Thus, the uniqueness of the main components in wood (cellulose and lignin) has attracted enormous interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, the emerging field of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood&#8208;derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials.

Herein, the emerging field of wood-derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood-derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood-derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self-healing and shape-memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood-derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood-derived functional polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Recent Progress on Cellulose&#8208;Based Ionic Compounds for Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds as either polymeric cellulose derivatives or ionic nanocellulose have gained tremendous attention within the last years due to their remarkable properties, especially their biological properties. Recent advances about various ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds with diverse functional moieties either along the cellulose chains or on the surface of nanocellulose for biomedical applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Glycans play important roles in all major kingdoms of organisms, such as archea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Cellulose, the most abundant polysaccharide on the Earth, plays a predominant role for mechanical stability in plants, and finds a plethora of applications by humans. Beyond traditional use, biomedical application of cellulose becomes feasible with advances of soluble cellulose derivatives with diverse functional moieties along the backbone and modified nanocellulose with versatile functional groups on the surface due to the native features of cellulose as both cellulose chains and supramolecular ordered domains as extractable nanocellulose. With the focus on ionic cellulose&#8208;based compounds involving both these groups primarily for biomedical applications, a brief introduction about glycoscience and especially native biologically active glycosaminoglycans with specific biomedical application areas on humans is given, which inspires further development of bioactive compounds from glycans. Then, both polymeric cellulose derivatives and nanocellulose&#8208;based compounds synthesized as versatile biomaterials for a large variety of biomedical applications, such as for wound dressings, controlled release, encapsulation of cells and enzymes, and tissue engineering, are separately described, regarding the diverse routes of synthesis and the established and suggested applications for these highly interesting materials.

         <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Flexible Functional Materials for Emerging Intelligent Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent research in the field of cellulose&#8208;based materials for flexible electronic applications is reviewed, including flexible sensors, biomimetic electronic skin, portable electrochemical energy storage devices, flexible nanogenerators, flexible organic thin&#8208;film transistors, printed radio&#8208;frequency identification devices, thin&#8208;film photovoltaic devices, and miniaturized bioelectronic devices. An outlook of future perspectives for this field is also presented.








Abstract
There is currently enormous and growing demand for flexible electronics for personalized mobile equipment, human&#8211;machine interface units, wearable medical&#8208;healthcare systems, and bionic intelligent robots. Cellulose is a well&#8208;known natural biopolymer that has multiple advantages including low cost, renewability, easy processability, and biodegradability, as well as appealing mechanical performance, dielectricity, piezoelectricity, and convertibility. Because of its multiple merits, cellulose is frequently used as a substrate, binder, dielectric layer, gel electrolyte, and derived carbon material for flexible electronic devices. Leveraging the advantages of cellulose to design advanced functional materials will have a significant impact on portable intelligent electronics. Herein, the unique molecular structure and nanostructures (nanocrystals, nanofibers, nanosheets, etc.) of cellulose are briefly introduced, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of cellulosic materials summarized, and the processing technologies for fabricating cellulose&#8208;based flexible electronics considered. The focus then turns to the recent advances of cellulose&#8208;based functional materials toward emerging intelligent electronic devices including flexible sensors, optoelectronic devices, field&#8208;effect transistors, nanogenerators, electrochemical energy storage devices, biomimetic electronic skins, and biological detection devices. Finally, an outlook of the potential challenges and future prospects for developing cellulose&#8208;based wearable devices and bioelectronic systems is presented.

         <title>Recent Developments in Cellulose Nanomaterial Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanomaterial (CNM) composites are sustainable and can compete on strength and stiffness with traditional materials. Unfortunately, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites in manners practical to commercialization.








Abstract
Cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) are a class of materials that have recently garnered attention in fields as varied as structural materials, biomaterials, rheology modifiers, construction, paper enhancement, and others. As the principal structural reinforcement of biomass giving wood its mechanical properties, CNM is strong and stiff, but also nontoxic, biodegradable, and sustainable with a very large (Gton yr&#8722;1) source. Unfortunately, due to the relatively young nature of the field and inherent incompatibility of CNM with most man&#8208;made materials in use today, research has tended to be more basic&#8208;science oriented rather than commercially applicable, so there are few CNM&#8208;enabled products on the market today. Herein, efforts are presented for preparing and forming cellulose nanomaterial nanocomposites. The focus is on recent efforts attempting to mitigate common impediments to practical commercialization but is also placed in context with traditional efforts. The work is presented in terms of the progress made, and still to be made, on solving the most pressing challenges&#8212;getting properties that are competitive with currently used materials, removing organic solvent, solving the inherent incompatibility between CNM and polymers of interest, and incorporation into commonly used industrial processing techniques.

         <title>Understanding Plant Biomass via Computational Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchical structures and properties of plant biomass (especially wood) and relevant computational modeling are reviewed, which may inspire the bottom&#8208;up design of new bio&#8208;based materials and the manufacturing of nanomaterials from plant biomass. Both modeling and relevant experimental studies of wood cell wall, cellulose, lignin, and their molecular units are summarized. Common hierarchical structures in nature are also compared with wood.








Abstract
Plant biomass, especially wood, has been used for structural materials since ancient times. It is also showing great potential for new structural materials and it is the major feedstock for the emerging biorefineries for building a sustainable society. The plant cell wall is a hierarchical matrix of mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Herein, the structure, properties, and reactions of cellulose, lignin, and wood cell walls, studied using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD), which are the widely used computational modeling approaches, are reviewed. Computational modeling, which has played a crucial role in understanding the structure and properties of plant biomass and its nanomaterials, may serve a leading role on developing new hierarchical materials from biomass in the future.

         <title>Thermal Management by Engineering the Alignment of Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A summary of how nanocellulose can be used to fabricate bioinspired building materials, including thermally super&#8208;insulating transparent and translucent aerogels and designable photonic reflectors, like the ones found in cuticles of beetles, is presented. These materials promise a boost of the energy efficiency of building envelopes, especially windows, so that no or very little supplemental energy would be needed to provide year&#8208;round occupant comfort.








Abstract
One of the grand current research challenges is to improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings, which cumulatively consume more than 40% of the energy generated globally. In addition to improving the comfort of the inhabitants and mitigating the growing energy consumption problem, new building materials and technologies could provide a safe strategy for geoengineering to mitigate global climate change. Herein, recent progress in developing such advanced materials from nanocellulose, which is often derived from wood or even dirty feedstocks like waste, is reviewed. By using chemical and bacteria&#8208;enabled processing, nanocellulose can be used to fabricate broadband photonic reflectors, thermally super&#8208;insulating aerogels, solar gain regulators, and low&#8208;emissivity coatings, with potential applications in windows, roofs, walls, and other components of buildings envelopes. These material developments draw inspiration from advanced energy management found in nature, such as the nanoporous photonic structures that evolved in cuticles of beetles. Fabrication of such materials takes advantage of mesoscale liquid crystalline self&#8208;assembly, which allows for pre&#8208;designed control of cellulose nanoparticle orientations at the mesoscale. With the potential fully realized, such materials could one day transform the current energy&#8208;lossy buildings into energy plants on Earth and possibly even enable extraterrestrial habitats.

In addition to improving the comfort of the inhabitants and mitigating the growing energy consumption problem, new building materials and technologies could provide a safe strategy for geoengineering to mitigate global climate change. Herein, recent progress in developing such advanced materials from nanocellulose, which is often derived from wood or even dirty feedstocks like waste, is reviewed. By using chemical and bacteria-enabled processing, nanocellulose can be used to fabricate broadband photonic reflectors, thermally super-insulating aerogels, solar gain regulators, and low-emissivity coatings, with potential applications in windows, roofs, walls, and other components of buildings envelopes. These material developments draw inspiration from advanced energy management found in nature, such as the nanoporous photonic structures that evolved in cuticles of beetles. Fabrication of such materials takes advantage of mesoscale liquid crystalline self-assembly, which allows for pre-designed control of cellulose nanoparticle orientations at the mesoscale. With the potential fully realized, such materials could one day transform the current energy-lossy buildings into energy plants on Earth and possibly even enable extraterrestrial habitats.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Functional Materials from Nanocellulose: Utilizing Structure&#8211;Property Relationships in Bottom&#8208;Up Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a natural and renewable building block for bottom&#8208;up fabrication, nanocellulose has gained considerable interest for the assembly of sophisticated materials with advanced functionality. The organization of nanocellulose into aligned, porous, and fibrous materials is highlighted, focusing on the inherent material properties enabling the formation of such structures, along with discussing key advancements and critical challenges within the field.








Abstract
It is inherently challenging to recapitulate the precise hierarchical architectures found throughout nature (such as in wood, antler, bone, and silk) using synthetic bottom&#8208;up fabrication strategies. However, as a renewable and naturally sourced nanoscale building block, nanocellulose&#8212;both cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibrils&#8212;has gained significant research interest within this area. Altogether, the intrinsic shape anisotropy, surface charge/chemistry, and mechanical/rheological properties are some of the critical material properties leading to advanced structure&#8208;based functionality within nanocellulose&#8208;based bottom&#8208;up fabricated materials. Herein, the organization of nanocellulose into biomimetic&#8208;aligned, porous, and fibrous materials through a variety of fabrication techniques is presented. Moreover, sophisticated material structuring arising from both the alignment of nanocellulose and via specific process&#8208;induced methods is covered. In particular, design rules based on the underlying fundamental properties of nanocellulose are established and discussed as related to their influence on material assembly and resulting structure/function. Finally, key advancements and critical challenges within the field are highlighted, paving the way for the fabrication of truly advanced materials from nanocellulose.

         <title>Plant Nanomaterials and Inspiration from Nature: Water Interactions and Hierarchically Structured Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, wood&#8208;based and man&#8208;made hydrogels are produced taking advantage of the properties and structure of elements present in the cell walls of plants, including (nano)celluloses. They endow new materials with features that include directionality, hierarchy, responsiveness, and function, all of which are associated to the composition and morphology of the building blocks.








Abstract
Recent developments in the area of plant&#8208;based hydrogels are introduced, especially those derived from wood as a widely available, multiscale, and hierarchical source of nanomaterials, as well as other cell wall elements. With water being fundamental in a hydrogel, water interactions, hydration, and swelling, all critically important in designing, processing, and achieving the desired properties of sustainable and functional hydrogels, are highlighted. A plant, by itself, is a form of a hydrogel, at least at given states of development, and for this reason phenomena such as fluid transport, diffusion, capillarity, and ionic effects are examined. These aspects are highly relevant not only to plants, especially lignified tissues, but also to the porous structures produced after removal of water (foams, sponges, cryogels, xerogels, and aerogels). Thus, a useful source of critical and comprehensive information is provided regarding the synthesis of hydrogels from plant materials (and especially wood nanostructures), and about the role of water, not only for processing but for developing hydrogel properties and uses.

         <title>Emerging Bioinspired Artificial Woods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial woods have emerged as a novel kind of wood&#8208;inspired engineering material with almost exactly the same channel microstructures and similar wall components. The performances of artificial woods depend on both the oriented channel and wall designs. The rational combination of other engineering polymers and channel&#8208;making techniques hold promise to develop more useful artificial woods.








Abstract
As an abundant natural resource, wood has gained great attention for thousands of years, spanning from the primitive construction materials to the modern high&#8208;added&#8208;value engineering materials. The unique delicate microstructures and the wonderful properties (e.g., low&#8208;density, high strength and stiffness, good toughness, and environmental sustainability) have made wood a natural source of inspiration that guides researchers to invent various wood&#8208;inspired materials. Herein, as an emerging material system, bioinspired artificial wood, with similar cellular structures and comparable mechanical properties, is discussed in the view of the design concept, fabrication strategy, properties, and possible applications. The present challenges and further research opportunities are also presented for artificial woods to thrive. To achieve the final eco&#8208;friendly artificial wood, more endeavors should be made in biomaterials and biodegradable or recyclable engineering of polymers to gain high mechanical properties and environmental sustainability simultaneously.

         <title>Advanced Nanowood Materials for the Water&#8211;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art review on novel nanowood materials and applications related to the water&#8211;energy nexus is presented. The unique structures and properties are highlighted, and how such features are harnessed by nanomanufacturing to enable sustainable water filtration, adsorption, catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as desalination and environmental cleanup, is discussed. Insights are offered on future development to enable a circular water economy.








Abstract
Wood materials are being reinvented to carry superior properties for a variety of new applications. Cutting&#8208;edge nanomanufacturing transforms traditional bulky and low&#8208;value woods into advanced materials that have desired structures, durability, and functions to replace nonrenewable plastics, polymers, and metals. Here, a first prospect report on how novel nanowood materials have been developed and applied in water and associated industries is provided, wherein their unique features and promises are discussed. First, the unique hierarchical structure and associated properties of the material are introduced, and then how such features can be harnessed and modified by either bottom&#8208;up or top&#8208;down manufacturing to enable different functions for water filtration, chemical adsorption and catalysis, energy and resource recovery, as well as energy&#8208;efficient desalination and environmental cleanup are discussed. The study recognizes that this is a nascent but very promising field; therefore, insights are offered to encourage more research and development. Trees harness solar energy and CO2 and provide abundant carbon&#8208;negative materials. Once harvested and utilized, it is believed that advanced wood materials will play a vital role in enabling a circular water economy.

         <title>Why Cellulose&#8208;Based Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent progress of cellulose, as an appealing natural material that can outperform traditional synthetic materials, for use in energy&#8208;storage devices is described. Cellulose can bring benefits in the fabrication and properties of energy&#8208;storage materials and devices, eventually enabling significant improvements in electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility, cost competitiveness, and form factors, which are difficult to achieve with conventional power source technologies.








Abstract
Recent findings demonstrate that cellulose, a highly abundant, versatile, sustainable, and inexpensive material, can be used in the preparation of very stable and flexible electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy and power densities by using electrodes with high mass loadings, composed of conducting composites with high surface areas and thin layers of electroactive material, as well as cellulose&#8208;based current collectors and functional separators. Close attention should, however, be paid to the properties of the cellulose (e.g., porosity, pore distribution, pore&#8208;size distribution, and crystallinity). The manufacturing of cellulose&#8208;based electrodes and all&#8208;cellulose devices is also well&#8208;suited for large&#8208;scale production since it can be made using straightforward filtration&#8208;based techniques or paper&#8208;making approaches, as well as utilizing various printing techniques. Herein, the recent development and possibilities associated with the use of cellulose are discussed, regarding the manufacturing of electrochemical energy storage devices comprising electrodes with high energy and power densities and lightweight current collectors and functional separators.

The manufacturing of cellulose-based electrodes and all-cellulose devices is also well-suited for large-scale production since it can be made using straightforward filtration-based techniques or paper-making approaches, as well as utilizing various printing techniques. Herein, the recent development and possibilities associated with the use of cellulose are discussed, regarding the manufacturing of electrochemical energy storage devices comprising electrodes with high energy and power densities and lightweight current collectors and functional separators.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
The unique physical and chemical properties of wood and its derivatives endow them with great potential to fabricate advanced materials for use in bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. The unique characteristics of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials are reviewed, with the aim of deepening understanding and inspiring new ideas in the area of advanced wood&#8208;based materials.








Abstract
Wood is a sustainable and renewable material that naturally has a hierarchical structure. Cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin are the three main components of wood. The unique physical and chemical properties of wood and its derivatives endow them with great potential as resources to fabricate advanced materials for use in bioengineering, flexible electronics, and clean energy. Nevertheless, comprehensive information on wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials is scarce, although much excellent progress has been made in this area. Here, the unique characteristics of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials are summarized, with regard to the fabrication principles, properties, applications, challenges, and future prospects of wood&#8208;derived carbon and light&#8208;emitting materials, with the aim of deepening the understanding and inspiring new ideas in the area of advanced wood&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Emerging Nanocellulose Technologies: Recent Developments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. Cellulose nanofibrils have significant amounts of charged groups on their surfaces. These surface&#8208;charged groups can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged to diverse metal and alkylammonium ions.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses have unique morphologies, characteristics, and surface nanostructures, and are prepared from abundant and renewable plant biomass resources. Therefore, expansion of the use of CO2&#8208;accumulating nanocelluloses is expected to partly contribute to the establishment of a sustainable society and help overcome current global environmental issues. Nanocelluloses can be categorized into cellulose nanonetworks, cellulose nanofibrils, and cellulose nanocrystals, depending on their morphologies. All of these materials are first obtained as aqueous dispersions. In particular, cellulose nanofibrils have homogeneous &#8776;3 nm widths and average lengths of &gt;500&#160;nm, and significant amounts of charged groups are present on their surfaces. Such charged groups are formed by carboxymethylation, C6&#8208;carboxylation, phosphorylation, phosphite esterification, xanthation, sulfate esterification, and C2/C3 dicarboxylation during the pretreatment of plant cellulose fibers before their conversion into cellulose nanofibrils via mechanical disintegration in water. These surface&#8208;charged groups in nanocelluloses can be stoichiometrically counterion&#8208;exchanged into diverse metal and alkylammonium ions, resulting in surface&#8208;modified nanocelluloses with various new functions including hydrophobic, water&#8208;resistant, catalytic, superdeodorant, and gas&#8208;separation properties. However, many fundamental and application&#8208;related issues facing nanocelluloses must first be overcome to enable their further expansion.

         <title>Thermally Insulating Nanocellulose&#8208;Based Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recently discovered potential of cellulose nanomaterials (CNMs) as raw materials to produce foams and aerogels for thermal insulation applications is described. The fundamental heat transfer contributions in such porous materials are summarized and put into context, through a selection of works highlighting highly efficient CNM&#8208;based isotropic and anisotropic insulation materials.








Abstract
Thermally insulating materials based on renewable nanomaterials such as nanocellulose could reduce the energy consumption and the environmental impact of the building sector. Recent reports of superinsulating cellulose nanomaterial (CNM)&#8208;based aerogels and foams with significantly better heat transport properties than the commercially dominating materials, such as expanded polystyrene, polyurethane foams, and glass wool, have resulted in a rapidly increasing research activity. Herein, the fundamental basis of thermal conductivity of porous materials is described, and the anisotropic heat transfer properties of CNMs and films with aligned CNMs and the processing and structure of novel CNM&#8208;based aerogels and foams with low thermal conductivities are presented and discussed. The extraordinarily low thermal conductivity of anisotropic porous architectures and multicomponent approaches are highlighted and related to the contributions of the Knudsen effect and phonon scattering.

         <title>Wood and the Activity of Dead Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements by the structural organization of cellulose fibrils. The cellulose fiber orientation determines the response of wood to environmental changes as an active material, thereby processing information and converting energy. Some examples for the harvesting of wood activity as well as bioinspiration are discussed.








Abstract
Wood is a prototypical biological material, which adapts to mechanical requirements. The microarchitecture of cellulose fibrils determines the mechanical properties of woody materials, as well as their actuation properties, based on absorption and desorption of water. Herein it is argued that cellulose fiber orientation corresponds to an analog code that determines the response of wood to humidity as an active material. Examples for the harvesting of wood activity, as well as bioinspiration, are given.

         <title>Biopolymers Derived from Trees as Sustainable Multifunctional Materials: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A timely overview of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is provided. The relationships between the structure, properties, performance, and applications of components from trees are comprehensively reviewed. A concise introduction of the corresponding chemistry and preparation methods of functional elements from the trees is given.








Abstract
The world is currently transitioning from a fossil&#8208;fuel&#8208;driven energy economy to one that is supplied by more renewable and sustainable materials. Trees as the most abundant renewable bioresource have attracted significant attention for advanced materials and manufacturing in this epochal transition. Trees are composed with complex structures and components such as trunk (stem and bark), leaf, flower, seed, and root. Although many excellent reviews have been published regarding advanced applications of wood and wood&#8208;derived biopolymers in different fields, such as energy, electronics, biomedical, and water treatment, no reviews have revisited and systematically discussed functional materials and even devices derived from trees in a full scope yet. Therefore, a timely summary of the recent development of materials and structures derived from different parts of trees for sustainability is prsented here. A concise introduction to the different parts of the trees is given first, which is followed by the corresponding chemistry and preparation of functional materials using various biopolymers from trees. The most promising applications of biopolymer&#8208;based materials are discussed subsequently. A comprehensive review of the different parts of trees as sustainable functional materials and devices for critical applications is thus provided.

         <title>Light Management with Natural Materials: From Whiteness to Transparency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide range of strategies is used to manage light propagation in plants and animals to produce transparent and white appearances. Inspired by nature, various transparent (low&#8208;scattering) and opaque (high&#8208;scattering) cellulose&#8208;based materials have been developed. The possibility to structure materials at the nanoscale is essential to control light&#8211;matter interaction and enables the fabrication of next&#8208;generation optical materials made of renewable biopolymers.








Abstract
The possibility of structuring material at the nanoscale is essential to control light&#8211;matter interactions and therefore fabricate next&#8208;generation paints and coatings. In this context, nature can serve not only as a source of inspiration for the design of such novel optical structures, but also as a primary source of materials. Here, some of the strategies used in nature to optimize light&#8211;matter interaction are reviewed and some of the recent progress in the production of optical materials made solely of plant&#8208;derived building blocks is highlighted. In nature, nano&#8208; to micrometer&#8208;sized structured materials made from biopolymers are at the origin of most of the light&#8208;transport effects. How natural photonic systems manage light scattering and what can be learned from plants and animals to produce photonic materials from biopolymers are discussed. Tuning the light&#8208;scattering properties via structural variations allows a wide range of appearances to be obtained, from whiteness to transparency, using the same renewable and biodegradable building blocks. Here, various transparent and white cellulose&#8208;based materials produced so far are highlighted.

         <title>Mechanics Design in Cellulose&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Performance Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;mechanics relationships of cellulose molecular chains give rise to unconventional cellulose&#8208;based functional materials that possess multiple beneficial mechanical properties such as high strength and toughness, in addition to other fundamentally attractive properties such as low&#8208;cost, lightweight, and sustainability.








Abstract
The abundance of cellulose found in natural resources such as wood, and the wide spectrum of structural diversity of cellulose nanomaterials in the form of micro&#8208;nano&#8208;sized particles and fibers, have sparked a tremendous interest to utilize cellulose's intriguing mechanical properties in designing high&#8208;performance functional materials, where cellulose's structure&#8211;mechanics relationships are pivotal. In this progress report, multiscale mechanics understanding of cellulose, including the key role of hydrogen bonding, the dependence of structural interfaces on the spatial hydrogen bond density, the effect of nanofiber size and orientation on the fracture toughness, are discussed along with recent development on enabling experimental design techniques such as structural alteration, manipulation of anisotropy, interface and topology engineering. Progress in these fronts renders cellulose a prospect of being effectuated in an array of emerging sustainable applications and being fabricated into high&#8208;performance structural materials that are both strong and tough.

         <dc:description>
Wood holocellulose fiber and nanofibrils with highly preserved native cellulose&#8722;hemicellulose structure can be obtained by mild delignification and low&#8208;energy mechanical treatment. Corresponding fiber network materials have excellent mechanical properties, high recycling ability, low embodied energy, and facile modification routes. The processing&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships are discussed, giving more insights into cellulosic material design with the aim of broadening their application areas.








Abstract
Mildly delignified wood holocellulose fibers show well&#8208;preserved cellulose nanofibril (CNF) structure in the fiber cell wall. Fibers, paper, biocomposites, and compression&#8208;molded fiber materials demonstrate excellent mechanical properties. Here, wood holocellulose fibers and corresponding CNFs are discussed with respect to nanostructure, mechanical performance, and advanced materials potential. Functionalization routes are discussed, as well as materials selection, nanoscience of recycling, and the embodied energy in cellulosic candidates for multifunctional structural materials.

         <title>Cellulose Nanomaterials in Interfacial Evaporators for Desalination: A &#8220;Natural&#8221; Choice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, cellulose nanomaterials are highly attractive supporting substrate materials in solar evaporators for sustainable desalination. The physiochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles and natural cellulose are discussed, and recent progress in utilizing cellulose&#8208;based materials such as wood, bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanofibrils, air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric in solar desalination is summarized.








Abstract
Herein, the recent advances in realizing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators for alleviating the global water crisis are summarized. Fresh water scarcity is one of the most threatening issues for sustainable development. Solar steam generation, which harnesses the abundant sunlight, has been recognized as a sustainable approach to harvest fresh water. In contrast to synthetic polymeric materials that can pose serious negative environmental impacts, cellulose&#8208;based materials, owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, are highly attractive for realizing solar steam generators. The molecular and macromolecular features of cellulose and the physicochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles (cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF)) and natural cellulose materials (wood and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC)) that make them attractive as supporting substrate materials in solar steam generators are briefly discussed. Recent progress in designing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators, including utilizing extracted cellulose nanoparticles via bottom&#8208;up assembly CNF, natural cellulose materials with intrinsic hierarchical structure (wood and BNC), and commercial planar cellulose substrates (air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric) is reviewed. The outstanding challenges that need to be addressed for these materials and devices to be utilized in the real&#8208;world and in overcoming global water crisis are also briefly highlighted.

         <title>Elucidating the Opportunities and Challenges for Nanocellulose Spinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 28, July 15, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanocellulose presents an opportunity for the development of a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers that can replace high&#8208;performance fossil&#8208;based fibers, as well as provide fibers with new advanced functionalities. Promising material concepts are available, but successful scale&#8208;up will need more profound insights into the mechanisms that control nanoscale assembly during processing.








Abstract
Man&#8208;made continuous fibers play an essential role in society today. With the increase in global sustainability challenges, there is a broad spectrum of societal needs where the development of advanced biobased fibers could provide means to address the challenges. Biobased regenerated fibers, produced from dissolved cellulose are widely used today for clothes, upholstery, and linens. With new developments in the area of advanced biobased fibers, it would be possible to compete with high&#8208;performance synthetic fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers as well as to provide unique functionalities. One possible development is to fabricate fibers by spinning filaments from nanocellulose, Nature's nanoscale high&#8208;performance building block, which will require detailed insights into nanoscale assembly mechanisms during spinning, as well as knowledge regarding possible functionalization. If successful, this could result in a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers. This work aims to identify the progress made in the field of spinning of nanocellulose filaments, as well as outline necessary steps for efficient fabrication of such nanocellulose&#8208;based filaments with controlled and predictable properties.

         <title>Rational Design of Immunomodulatory Hydrogels for Chronic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro&#8208;inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.








Abstract
With all the advances in tissue engineering for construction of fully functional skin tissue, complete regeneration of chronic wounds is still challenging. Since immune reaction to the tissue damage is critical in regulating both the quality and duration of chronic wound healing cascade, strategies to modulate the immune system are of importance. Generally, in response to an injury, macrophages switch from pro&#8208;inflammatory to an anti&#8208;inflammatory phenotype. Therefore, controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization has become an appealing approach in regenerative medicine. Recently, hydrogels&#8208;based constructs, incorporated with various cellular and molecular signals, have been developed and utilized to adjust immune cell functions in various stages of wound healing. Here, the current state of knowledge on immune cell functions during skin tissue regeneration is first discussed. Recent advanced technologies used to design immunomodulatory hydrogels for controlling macrophages&#8217; polarization are then summarized. Rational design of hydrogels for providing controlled immune stimulation via hydrogel chemistry and surface modification, as well as incorporation of cell and molecules, are also dicussed. In addition, the effects of hydrogels&#8217; properties on immunogenic features and the wound healing process are summarized. Finally, future directions and upcoming research strategies to control immune responses during chronic wound healing are highlighted.

&lt;p&gt;Quality and duration of the healing process can be regulated via modulation of immune responses to tissue injury. Specifically, controlling pro-inflammatory phenotype&#8211;anti-inflammatory phenotype progression is a crucial step to ensure a conversion from the inflammatory to the healing stage. In this regard, immunomodulatory hydrogels with specific chemistry and surface properties can influence immune cell polarization and the chronic wound healing process.

         <title>Engineering Microdomains of Oxides in High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Electrodes toward Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of bulk electrodes is designed by incorporating oxide microdomains into the so&#8208;called high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs). From these, unprecedented oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is&#160;achieved, with an ultralow overpotential of 196&#160;mV and a Tafel slope of 29&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and with stability longer than 120&#160;h in 1&#160;m KOH solution at current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
One important goal of the current electrocatalysis is to develop integrated electrodes from the atomic level design to multilevel structural engineering in simple ways and low prices. Here, a series of oxygen micro&#8208;alloyed high&#8208;entropy alloys (O&#8208;HEAs) is developed via a metallurgy approach. A (CrFeCoNi)97O3 bulk O&#8208;HEA shows exceptional electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), reaching an overpotential as low as 196&#160;mV and a Tafel slope of 29&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and with stability longer than 120&#160;h in 1&#160;m KOH solution at a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. It is shown that the enhanced OER performance can be attributed to the formation of island&#8208;like Cr2O3 microdomains, the leaching of Cr3+ ions, and structural amorphization at the interfaces of the domains. These findings offer a technological&#8208;orientated strategy to integrated electrodes.

         <title>Energy Autonomous Sweat&#8208;Based Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sweat&#8208;based energy harvesting and storage devices, along with the key components of sweat&#8208;based energy autonomous wearables systems are comprehensively reviewed. Various considerations such as the power management and the sweat extraction, etc., are discussed for continuous operation of sweat&#8208;based systems.








Abstract
The continuous operation of wearable electronics demands reliable sources of energy, currently met through Li&#8208;ion batteries and various energy harvesters. These solutions are being used out of necessity despite potential safety issues and unsustainable environmental impact. Safe and sustainable energy sources can boost the use of wearables systems in diverse applications such as health monitoring, prosthetics, and sports. In this regard, sweat&#8208; and sweat&#8208;equivalent&#8208;based studies have attracted tremendous attention through the demonstration of energy&#8208;generating biofuel cells, promising power densities as high as 3.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, storage using sweat&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based supercapacitors with energy and power densities of 1.36&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and 329.70 W&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, and sweat&#8208;activated batteries with an impressive energy density of 67 Ah kg&#8722;1. A combination of these energy generating, and storage devices can lead to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables capable of providing sustainable power in the &#181;W to mW range, which is sufficient to operate both sensing and communication devices. Here, a comprehensive review covering these advances, addressing future challenges and potential solutions related to fully energy&#8208;autonomous wearables is presented, with emphasis on sweat&#8208;based energy storage and energy generation elements along with sweat&#8208;based sensors as applications.

         <title>3D Atomic&#8208;Scale Dynamics of Laser&#8208;Light&#8208;Induced Restructuring of Nanoparticles Unraveled by Electron Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution electron tomography reveals atomic rearrangements in metal nanoparticles upon femtosecond laser excitation. Based on the measured 3D atomic structure, molecular dynamics simulations unravel the dynamics of the underlying process and give insight on how strain, crystal facet distribution, and surface diffusion govern these rearrangements.








Abstract
Understanding light&#8211;matter interactions in nanomaterials is crucial for optoelectronic, photonic, and plasmonic applications. Specifically, metal nanoparticles (NPs) strongly interact with light and can undergo shape transformations, fragmentation and ablation upon (pulsed) laser excitation. Despite being vital for technological applications, experimental insight into the underlying atomistic processes is still lacking due to the complexity of such measurements. Herein, atomic resolution electron tomography is performed on the same mesoporous&#8208;silica&#8208;coated gold nanorod, before and after femtosecond laser irradiation, to assess the missing information. Combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on the experimentally determined 3D atomic&#8208;scale morphology, the complex atomistic rearrangements, causing shape deformations and defect generation, are unraveled. These rearrangements are simultaneously driven by surface diffusion, facet restructuring, and strain formation, and are influenced by subtleties in the atomic distribution at the&#160;surface.

         <title>Size Effect of Organosulfur and In Situ Formed Oligomers Enables High&#8208;Utilization Na&#8211;Organosulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
4,4&#8242;&#8208;Thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT) and its oligomers formed in situ in charging have large size, and therefore can be blocked by the nanosized ion&#8208;conducting clusters in sodiated Nafion membranes, leading to enhanced performance of sodium batteries. The Na|TBBT cell retains 77% of the theoretical capacity of TBBT after 300 cycles (2420 h). In addition, the Na|TBBT flow cell also shows promising rechargeability.








Abstract
Organosulfurs are promising cathode materials for rechargeable metal batteries due to their high capacities, diverse structures, and electrochemical properties. Herein, the electrochemical behavior of three organosulfur compounds, i.e., 4,4&#8242;&#8208;thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT), 1,4&#8208;benzenedithiol (1,4&#8208;BDT), and diphenyl disulfide (DPDS), is revealed in room&#8208;temperature rechargeable sodium (Na) batteries, which show significantly improved performances when sodiated Nafion membranes are used. Large oligomers of organosulfur can be formed during charging, and they are readily blocked by the nanosized ion&#8208;conducting clusters in the Nafion membrane. In addition, large organosulfur monomers can also be blocked. Only 5.4% of TBBT diffuses through the Nafion membrane after 800 h. The Na|TBBT cell sustains 77% of the theoretical capacity after 300 cycles (2420 h). Moreover, the Na|TBBT redox flow cell shows promising rechargeability. Due to the medium molecular size, the organosulfur oligomers are expected to provide a new avenue to develop high&#8208;capacity chalcogen cathodes, besides inorganic S and S&#8208;containing polymers.

         <title>The Manufacture of Unbreakable Bionics via Multifunctional and Self&#8208;Healing Silk&#8211;Graphene Hydrogels</title>

Biomaterials that transmit electricity like the human body can open new opportunities. For seamless mirroring of our&#160;anatomy, they also need to conform to its curvilinear architecture, and display self&#8208;healing ability like native organs and tissues. To address this, a conductive, adhesive, reconfigurable, and viscoelastic gum (CareGum), with promising applications in cyborganics, bionics, and soft robotics, is developed.








Abstract
Biomaterials capable of transmitting signals over longer distances than those in rigid electronics can open new opportunities for humanity by mimicking the way tissues propagate information. For seamless mirroring of the human body, they also have to display conformability to its curvilinear architecture, as well as, reproducing native&#8208;like mechanical and electrical properties combined with the ability to self&#8208;heal on demand like native organs and tissues. Along these lines, a multifunctional composite is developed by mixing silk fibroin and reduced graphene oxide. The material is coined &#8220;CareGum&#8221; and capitalizes on a phenolic glue to facilitate sacrificial and hierarchical hydrogen bonds. The hierarchal bonding scheme gives rise to high mechanical toughness, record&#8208;breaking elongation capacity of &#8776;25 000%, excellent conformability to arbitrary and complex surfaces, 3D printability, a tenfold increase in electrical conductivity, and a fourfold increase in Young's modulus compared to its pristine counterpart. By taking advantage of these unique properties, a durable and self&#8208;healing bionic glove is developed for hand gesture sensing and sign translation. Indeed, CareGum is a new advanced material with promising applications in fields like cyborganics, bionics, soft robotics, human&#8211;machine interfaces, 3D&#8208;printed electronics, and flexible bioelectronics.

         <title>A Biomimetic Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer with Antigen&#8208;Presenting and Hitchhiking Function for Lipid Droplet Targeted Photodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with antigen&#8208;presenting and hitchhiking abilities (DC@AIEdots) are presented by coating dendritic cell (DC) membranes on AIE nanoaggregates. The inner AIE molecules could selectively accumulate in tumor cells, and the outer cell membrane could facilitate DC@AIEdots to hitchhike on endogenous T cells, enhancing tumor delivery efficiency and stimulating T cell proliferation and activation in vivo.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a promising alternative approach for effective cancer treatment that is associated with an antitumor immune response. However, immunosuppression of the tumor microenvironment limits the immune response induced by PDT. Stimulation and proliferation of T cells is a critical step for generating immune responses and depends on the efficient presentation of tumor antigens and co&#8208;stimulatory molecules by antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs). Here, biomimetic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizers with antigen&#8208;presenting and hitchhiking abilities (DC@AIEdots) are developed by coating dendritic cell (DC) membranes on the nanoaggregates of the AIEgens. Notably, the inner AIE molecules can selectively accumulate in lipid droplets of tumor cells, and the outer cell membrane can facilitate the hitchhiking of DC@AIEdots onto the endogenous T cells and enhance the tumor delivery efficiency by about 1.6&#160;times. Furthermore, DC@AIEdots can stimulate the in vivo proliferation and activation of T cells and trigger the immune system. The potential applications of therapeutic agents targeting lipid droplets for immunotherapy are indicated and a new hitchhiking approach for drug delivery is provided. Lastly, the study presents a photoactive and artificial antigen&#8208;presenting platform for effective T cell stimulation and cancer photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Assembly of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly process is reported for fabricating highly ordered organic semiconductor arrays. The central concept of the molecule design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy"&#8212;is to increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, thereby inducing conformation locking of adjacent molecules through cooperative [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular assembly is a promising bottom&#8208;up approach for producing materials that behave as charge transporting components in electronic devices. Although extensive advances have been made during the past two decades, formidable challenges exist in controlling the local randomness present in supramolecular assemblies. Here, a temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly strategy using heat to heal defects and disorders is reported. The central concept of the molecular design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy" in this research&#8212;is to: i) increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, ii) induce conformation&#8208;fitting of adjacent molecules through two different kinds of intermolecular [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions, and finally iii) lock the nearby molecules in inactive co&#8208;conformations. Experimentally, upon heating to 57&#160;&#176;C, amorphous solid&#8208;state films undergo spontaneous assembly, leading to the growth of uniform and highly ordered microwire arrays. Temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly provides an approach closer to the precision control of assembled structures and presents with a broad canvas to work on in approaching a new generation of supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Hydroxyapatite Nanorods Function as Safe and Effective Growth Factors Regulating Neural Differentiation and Neuron Development</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating the neural differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) into mature neurons is attractive for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases using an NSC approach. With their slow&#8208;release and long&#8208;acting properties, hydroxyapatite nanorods promote the differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well&#8208;defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. It is superior to natural differentiation that requires 2 weeks.








Abstract
Neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. However, the slow spontaneous differentiation of NSCs often hampers their application in neural repair. Although some biological growth factors accelerate the differentiation of NSCs, their high cost, short half&#8208;life, and unpredictable behavior in vivo, as well as the complexity of the operation, hinder their clinical use. In this study, it is demonstrated that hydroxyapatite (HAp), the main component of bone, in the form of nanorods, can regulate the neural differentiation of NSCs and maturation of the newly differentiated cells. Culturing NSCs with HAp nanorods leads to the differentiation of NSCs into mature neurons that exhibit well&#8208;defined electrophysiological behavior within 5 days. The state of these neurons is much better than when culturing the cells without HAp nanorods, which undergo a 2&#8208;week differentiation process. Furthermore, RNA&#8208;sequencing data reveal that the neuroactive ligand&#8211;receptor interaction pathway is dominant in the enriched differentiated neuronal population. Hence, inorganic growth factors like HAp act as a feasible, effective, safe, and practical tool for regulating the differentiation of NSCs and can potentially be used in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

         <title>A Well&#8208;Mixed Phase Formed by Two Compatible Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors Enables Ternary Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.6%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient organic solar cells are fabricated using a ternary approach, wherein a novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F is designed and incorporated into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F and BTP&#8208;eC9 are found to form a homogeneous mixed phase, which improves the molecular packing of both donor and acceptor materials, and optimizes the ternary blend morphology. A record&#8208;high efficiency of 18.66% is consequently achieved.








Abstract
The ternary strategy, introducing a third component into a binary blend, opens a simple and promising avenue to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The judicious selection of an appropriate third component, without sacrificing the photocurrent and voltage output of the OSC, is of significant importance in ternary devices. Herein, highly efficient OSCs fabricated using a ternary approach are demonstrated, wherein a novel non&#8208;fullerene acceptor L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F is designed and incorporated into the PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 blend. The three components&#160;show complementary absorption&#160;spectra&#160;and cascade energy alignment. L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F and BTP&#8208;eC9 are found to form a homogeneous mixed phase, which improves the molecular packing of both the donor and acceptor materials, and optimizes the ternary blend morphology. Moreover, the addition of L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F into the binary blend suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination, thus leading to a reduced voltage loss. Consequently, concurrent increases in open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current, and fill factor are realized, resulting in an unprecedented PCE of 18.66% (certified value of 18.2%), which represents the highest efficiency values reported for both single&#8208;junction and tandem OSCs so far.

&lt;p&gt;The ternary strategy, introducing a third component into a binary blend, opens a simple and promising avenue to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). The judicious selection of an appropriate third component, without sacrificing the photocurrent and voltage output of the OSC, is of significant importance in ternary devices. Herein, highly efficient OSCs fabricated using a ternary approach are demonstrated, wherein a novel non-fullerene acceptor L8-BO-F is designed and incorporated into the PM6:BTP-eC9 blend. The three components&#160;show complementary absorption&#160;spectra&#160;and cascade energy alignment. L8-BO-F and BTP-eC9 are found to form a homogeneous mixed phase, which improves the molecular packing of both the donor and acceptor materials, and optimizes the ternary blend morphology. Moreover, the addition of L8-BO-F into the binary blend suppresses the non-radiative recombination, thus leading to a reduced voltage loss. Consequently, concurrent increases in open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor are realized, resulting in an unprecedented PCE of 18.66% (certified value of 18.2%), which represents the highest efficiency values reported for both single-junction and tandem OSCs so far.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Facet&#8208;Oriented Coupling Enables Fast and Sensitive Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to achieve enhanced coupling from colloidal quantum dot (CQD) inks is introduced. By using colloidal atomic layer deposition, the surface of CQDs is reconstructed to facilitate coupling along the (100) facets and increase coupling. This increases the hole mobility by one order of magnitude and enables the fabrication of record&#8208;speed solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared photodiodes.








Abstract
Charge carrier transport in colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solids is strongly influenced by coupling among CQDs. The shape of as&#8208;synthesized CQDs results in random orientational relationships among facets in CQD solids, and this limits the CQD coupling strength and the resultant performance of optoelectronic devices. Here, colloidal&#8208;phase reconstruction of CQD surfaces, which improves facet alignment in CQD solids, is reported. This strategy enables control over CQD faceting and allows demonstration of enhanced coupling in CQD solids. The approach utilizes post&#8208;synthetic resurfacing and unites surface passivation and colloidal stability with a propensity for dots to couple via (100):(100) facets, enabling increased hole mobility. Experimentally, the CQD solids exhibit a 10&#215; increase in measured hole mobility compared to control CQD solids, and enable photodiodes (PDs) exhibiting 70% external quantum efficiency (vs 45% for control devices) and specific detectivity, D*&#160;&gt;&#160;1012&#160;Jones, each at 1550&#160;nm. The photodetectors feature a 7&#160;ns response time for a 0.01&#160;mm2 area&#8212;the fastest reported for solution&#8208;processed short&#8208;wavelength infrared PDs.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Light&#8208;Responsive Upconversion&#8208;and&#8208;Downshifting&#8208;Based Circularly Polarized Luminescent Switches in Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;regulated upconversion (UC)&#8208; and downshifting (DS)&#8208;circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) switches are achieved by integrating chiral metal&#8211;organic frameworks with luminescent diarylethenes and UC nanoparticles. UC&#8208;CPL exhibits a higher dissymmetry factor than that of DS&#8208;CPL, and a chiroptical logic circuit with 2D information output is fabricated based on this switch.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted tremendous attention for several novel applications. However, functional MOFs with light&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are not examined in detail. Therefore, a dual CPL switch exhibiting both upconversion (UC) and downshifting (DS) CPL in the solid state is constructed by loading a luminescent diarylethene derivative (DAEC) and UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) into chiral MOFs. The chiral MOF&#8835;DAEC composites exhibit both photoswitchable luminescence and DS&#8208;CPL properties under alternating UV and visible light irradiation. Additionally, a reversible UC&#8208;CPL switch is realized using near&#8208;infrared (NIR) and visible light irradiation by introducing energy&#8208;level&#8208;matched UCNPs and DAEC into the chiral MOFs. The dissymmetry factor (glum) of UC&#8208;CPL is noted to be significantly amplified through energy transfer compared to that of DS&#8208;CPL, which indicates that the information on circular polarization can be manipulated by altering the incident light. A chiroptical logic circuit with a 2D information output is designed with UV, visible, and NIR light as inputs by setting a rational threshold.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Molecular&#8208;Aggregate&#8208;Based Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Judicious Ligand Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetradentate Pd(II) complex, i.e., Pd3O8&#8208;Py5, exhibiting efficient aggregate emission is developed through judicious ligand design. The optimized organic light&#8208;emitting diode device using Pd3O8&#8208;Py5 aggregates exhibits a peak EQEair of 37.3% and a peak EQEair+sub of 67.4% with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off, and a long measured LT95 lifetime (time to 95% of the initial luminance) of over 500 h with an initial brightness of 17&#160;304 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Phosphorescent molecular aggregates show promise in realizing efficient and stable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) operating at high brightness level, which is highly desired for future lighting and display applications. Herein, four tetradentate Pd(II) complexes are prepared with judicious ligand design, and their electrochemical and photophysical properties are thoroughly examined. The studies indicate that slight structural changes of ligands can modify the hole and electron transporting capabilities, and alter the horizontal emitting dipole ratios of aggregates in amorphous film, the latter of which are sensitive to the thin&#8208;film deposition conditions including the deposition rate and the choice of the templating layer. An optimized OLED device using Pd3O8&#8208;Py5 aggregates exhibits a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 37.3% and a reduced efficiency roll&#8208;off with high EQEs of 36.0% and 32.5% at 1000 and 10&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, respectively. Moreover, such an efficient device demonstrates a long measured LT95 (time to 95% of the initial luminance) lifetime of over 500 h with an initial brightness of 17&#160;304&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 corresponding to an estimated LT95 lifetime of 48&#160;246 h at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

Novel applications, such as, soft robotics and haptics, require emerging material systems whose stiffness can be selectively programmed using an electrical input to increase performance and simplify designs. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art materials with electroprogrammable stiffness are reviewed, categorizing them into those governed by electrostatics and phase&#8208;changes, and identifying challenges and opportunities toward the next generation of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stiffness is a mechanical property of vital importance to any material system and is typically considered a static quantity. Recent work, however, has shown that novel materials with programmable stiffness can enhance the performance and simplify the design of engineered systems, such as morphing wings, robotic grippers, and wearable exoskeletons. For many of these applications, the ability to program stiffness with electrical activation is advantageous because of the natural compatibility with electrical sensing, control, and power networks ubiquitous in autonomous machines and robots. The numerous applications for materials with electrically driven stiffness modulation has driven a rapid increase in the number of publications in this field. Here, a comprehensive review of the available materials that realize electroprogrammable stiffness is provided, showing that all current approaches can be categorized as using electrostatics or electrically activated phase changes, and summarizing the advantages, limitations, and applications of these materials. Finally, a perspective identifies state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art trends and an outlook of future opportunities for the development and use of materials with electroprogrammable stiffness.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Highly Reversible Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogue, Nax(FeMnNiCuCo)[Fe(CN)6], is developed as a robust host structure for reversible sodium insertion. Battery cells using the new cathode active material show significantly improved cycling performance and stability, among others due to its nearly zero&#8208;strain operation.








Abstract
Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) are reported to be efficient sodium storage materials because of the unique advantages of their metal&#8211;organic framework structure. However, the issues of low specific capacity and poor reversibility, caused by phase transitions during charge/discharge cycling, have thus far limited the applicability of these materials. Herein, a new approach is presented to substantially improve the electrochemical properties of PBAs by introducing high entropy into the crystal structure. To achieve this, five different metal species are introduced, sharing the same nitrogen&#8208;coordinated site, thereby increasing the configurational entropy of the system beyond 1.5R. By careful selection of the elements, high&#8208;entropy PBA (HE&#8208;PBA) presents a quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain reaction mechanism, resulting in increased cycling stability and rate capability. The key to such improvement lies in the high entropy and associated effects as well as the presence of several active redox centers. The gassing behavior of PBAs is also reported. Evolution of dimeric cyanogen due to oxidation of the cyanide ligands is detected, which can be attributed to the structural degradation of HE&#8208;PBA during battery operation. By optimizing the electrochemical window, a Coulombic efficiency of nearly 100% is retained after cycling for more than 3000 cycles.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Picosecond Nanodiodes for Low&#8208;Power Ultrafast Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates ultrafast electrical response down to record sub&#8208;picosecond with a low turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.7&#160;V by developing a novel fabricated coplanar full&#8208;metal tip&#8208;to&#8208;edge nanostructure with asymmetrical sub&#8208;10&#160;nm air channel, providing important implications to address a series of longstanding bottlenecks in continuously improved modern electronics.








Abstract
The tradeoff between ultrahigh speed and low power is a dominant challenge in continuously improving modern electronics. Fundamental electronic devices with ultrafast response are highly desired in low&#8208;power electronics. However, conventional semiconductor electronic devices now near the speed limit from the physical roadblocks including short&#8208;channel effect, restricted carrier velocity, and heat death. Currently emerging electronic devices also face formidable difficulties to achieve high&#8208;speed performance at low operating voltage without heat disturbance. Here, a novel fabricated coplanar tip&#8208;to&#8208;edge semiconductor&#8208;free nanostructure with asymmetric sub&#8208;10&#160;nm air channel is reported, stimulating electric&#8208;field accelerated scattering&#8208;free transport of electrons and resulting in ultrafast response of record sub&#8208;picoseconds at a low turn&#8208;on voltage around 0.7&#160;V. Simulation results show a typical electrical response down to 64 fs, which is &#8776;103 times faster than that of conventional semiconductor electronic devices. The coplanar asymmetric nanostructure allows a high rectifying ratio up to 106 which is superior to that of the most promising 2D semiconducting nanodiodes. In addition, heat death is overcome due to the inherent advantages from the novel nanostructure and underlying working mechanism. The intriguing nanodiodes will attract broadly interests in electronics due to their potential as rudimentary building blocks in ultrafast electronic integrated circuits.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of 0D&#8211;2D Heterostructure Electrocatalyst from MOF and MXene for Boosted Lithium Polysulfide Conversion Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 0D&#8211;2D heterostructure electrocatalyst from metal&#8211;organic framework and MXene is proposed as a catalytic cathode for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The 0D CoZn&#8208;Se and 2D N&#8208;MXene co&#8208;catalysts form double lithiophilic&#8211;sulfiphilic binding sites, promote Li ion diffusion, and reduce the energy barrier of Li2S deposition/dissolution. The catalytic cathode exhibits ultralong cycle life and high area capacity under high sulfur loading and lean electrolyte operation.








Abstract
The design of nanostructured electrocatalysts with high activity and long&#8208;term durability for the sluggish lithium polysulfide (LiPS) conversion reaction is essential for the development of high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of bimetallic selenides on nitrogen&#8208;doped MXene (CoZn&#8208;Se@N&#8208;MX) based on the self&#8208;assembly of metal&#8211;organic framework and MXene is reported. A combination of 0D CoZn&#8208;Se nanoparticles and 2D N&#8208;MX nanosheet co&#8208;catalysts forms double lithiophilic&#8208;sulfifilic binding sites that effectively immobilize and catalytically convert LiPS intermediates. This 0D&#8211;2D heterostructure catalyst has a hierarchical porous architecture with a large active area and enables rapid Li ion diffusion, reduces the activation energy of Li2S deposition, and lowers the energy barrier of Li2S dissolution. In addition, an assembled CoZn&#8208;Se@N&#8208;MX hybrid synergistically prevents the aggregation of the CoZn&#8208;Se nanoparticles and restacking of the active areas of N&#8208;MX nanosheets during assembly and the LiPS conversion process. The Li&#8211;S battery with this 0D&#8211;2D catalyst delivers excellent rate capability, ultralong cycling life (over 2000 cycles), and a high areal capacity of 6.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 with a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Mapping of Moir&#233; Superlattices by Hyperspectral Raman Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Moir&#233; superlattices produced through artificial stacking are often quite inhomogeneous and are challenging to characterize noninvasively. In this work, interlayer&#8208;breathing mode and moir&#233; phonons are proven to be highly susceptible to the moir&#233; period, and enable large&#8208;scale mapping of moir&#233; superlattices by hyperspectral Raman imaging.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices can induce correlated&#8208;electronic phases in twisted van der Waals materials: strongly correlated quantum phenomena emerge, such as superconductivity and the Mott&#8208;insulating state. However, moir&#233; superlattices produced through artificial stacking can be quite inhomogeneous, which hampers the development of a clear correlation between the moir&#233; period and the emerging electrical and optical properties. Here, it is demonstrated in twisted&#8208;bilayer transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides that low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering can be utilized not only to detect atomic reconstruction, but also to map out the inhomogeneity of the moir&#233; lattice over large areas. The method is established based on the finding that both the interlayer&#8208;breathing mode and moir&#233; phonons are highly susceptible to the moir&#233; period and provide characteristic fingerprints. Hyperspectral Raman imaging visualizes microscopic domains of a 5&#176; twisted&#8208;bilayer sample with an effective twist&#8208;angle resolution of about 0.1&#176;. This ambient methodology can be conveniently implemented to characterize and preselect high&#8208;quality areas of samples for subsequent device fabrication, and for transport and optical experiments.

         <title>A Partial Sulfuration Strategy Derived Multi&#8208;Yolk&#8211;Shell Structure for Ultra&#8208;Stable K/Na/Li&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A partial sulfuration strategy is developed to fabricate multi&#8208;yolk&#8211;shell structure for overcoming the barriers of high&#8208;capacity anodes. Integrating both the merits of yolk&#8211;shell structure for good structural stability and the multiple connection points for fast ion/electron transportation, as&#8208;designed composite delivers superior rate capability and long&#8208;term cyclability for K/Na/Li&#8208;ion storage, outperforming most reported yolk&#8211;shell structures and metal&#8208;sulfide based anodes.








Abstract
Metal sulfides are attractive anodes for alkali metal ion batteries due to the high theoretical capacity, while their practical implementation is hampered by the inherent poor conductivity and vast volume variation during cycles. Approaching rational designed microstructures with good stability and fast charge transfer is of great importance in response to these issues. Herein, a partial sulfuration strategy for the rational construction of multi&#8208;yolk&#8211;shell (m&#8208;Y&#8211;S) structures, from which multiple Fe1&#8722;xS nanoparticles are confined within hollow carbon nanosheet with tunable interior void space is reported. As anode materials, the m&#8208;Y&#8211;S Fe1&#8722;xS@C composite can display high capacity and excellent rate capability (134, 365, and 447&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 for K+, Na+, and Li+ storage at 20 A g&#8722;1). Remarkably, it exhibits ultra&#8208;stable potassium storage up to 1200, 6000, and 20&#160;000 cycles under current densities of 0.1, 0.5, and 1 A g&#8722;1, which is much superior to previous yolk&#8211;shell structures and metal&#8208;sulfide anodes. Based on comprehensive experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, the exceptional performance of m&#8208;Y&#8211;S structure can be ascribed to the optimized interior void space for good structure stability, as well as the multiple connection points and conductive carbon layer for superior electron/ion transportation.

         <title>Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Attractive Pickering emulsion gels (APEGs) are designed and developed by engineering interdroplet interactions at molecular scale, where telechelic polymers bridge neighboring particle&#8208;stabilized droplets via electrostatic attraction, forming a bridged droplet network with shear thinning properties. APEGs are ideal inks for 3D printing and can be employed as templates to prepare functional porous materials.








Abstract
Properties of emulsions highly depend on the interdroplet interactions and, thus, engineering interdroplet interactions at molecular scale are essential to achieve desired emulsion systems. Here, attractive Pickering emulsion gels (APEGs) are designed and prepared by bridging neighboring particle&#8208;stabilized droplets via telechelic polymers. In the APEGs, each telechelic molecule with two amino end groups can simultaneously bind to two carboxyl functionalized nanoparticles in two neighboring droplets, forming a bridged network. The APEG systems show typical shear&#8208;thinning behaviors and their viscoelastic properties are tunable by temperature, pH, and molecular weight of the telechelic polymers, making them ideal for direct 3D printing. The APEGs can be photopolymerized to prepare APEG&#8208;templated porous materials and their microstructures can be tailored to optimize their performances, making the APEG systems promising for a wide range of applications.

         <title>S&#8208;Decorated Porous Ti3C2 MXene Combined with In Situ Forming Cu2Se as Effective Shuttling Interrupter in Na&#9472;Se Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
S&#8208;decorated porous Ti3C2 MXene is used as effective selenium host, giving high capacity, rate capability, and long lifespan of Na&#9472;Se battery. The S&#8208;decorated interfaces combined with in situ forming Cu2Se facilitate the immobilization and transformation of polyselenides and thus lead to efficient surface&#8208;dominated capacitive behavior.








Abstract
Given natural abundance of Na and superior kinetics of Se, Na&#9472;Se batteries have attracted much attention but still face the problem of shuttling effect of soluble intermediates. The first&#8208;principle calculations reveal the S&#8208;decorated Ti3C2 exhibits increased binding energy to sodium polyselenides, suggesting a better capture and restriction on intermediates. The obtained Se@S&#8208;decorated porous Ti3C2 (Se@S&#9472;P&#9472;Ti3C2) exhibits a high reversible capacity of 765 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 (calculated based on Se), &#8776;1.2, 1.3, and 1.7 times of Se@porous Ti3C2 (Se@P&#9472;Ti3C2), Se@Ti3C2, and Se, respectively. It gives considerable capacity of 664 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1 and impressive cycling stability over 2300 cycles with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.003% per cycle. The excellent electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the S&#8208;modified porous Ti3C2, which provides effective immobilization toward polyselenides, makes full use of nanosized Se, and alleviates volume expansion during sodiation/desodiation. Additionally, in situ forming Cu2Se can generate Cu nanoparticles through discharge process and then transform polyselenides into solid&#8208;phase Cu2Se, further suppressing the shuttling effect. This work provides a practical strategy to immobilize and transform sodium polyselenides for high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life Na&#9472;Se batteries.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Respiration Monitoring Enabled By a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Respiration carries a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion monitoring and chemical breath analysis.








Abstract
In mammals, physiological respiration involves respiratory cycles of inhaled and exhaled breaths, which has traditionally been an underutilized resource potentially encompassing a wealth of physiologically relevant information as well as clues to potential diseases. Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have been widely adopted for self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring owing to their compelling features, such as decent biocompatibility, wearing comfort, low&#8208;cost, and high sensitivity to respiration activities in the aspect of low frequency and slight amplitude body motions. Physiological respiration behaviors and exhaled chemical regents can be precisely and continuously monitored by TENG&#8208;based respiration sensors for personalized health care. This article presents an overview of TENG enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring, with a focus on the working principle, sensing materials, functional structures, and related applications in both physical respiration motion detection and chemical breath analysis. Concepts and approaches for acquisition of physical information associated with respiratory rate and depth are covered in the first part. Then the sensing mechanism, theoretical modeling, and applications related to detection of chemicals released from breathing gases are systemically summarized. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of triboelectric effect enabled self&#8208;powered respiration monitoring are comprehensively discussed and criticized.

         <title>A Full&#8208;Spectrum Porphyrin&#8211;Fullerene D&#8211;A Supramolecular Photocatalyst with Giant Built&#8208;In Electric Field for Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;spectrum responsive donor&#8211;acceptor supramolecular photocatalyst TPPS/C60 is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%. The TPPS/C60 performs with a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure and the giant internal electric field dramatically promote the charge separation.








Abstract
A full&#8208;spectrum (300&#8211;850&#160;nm) responsive donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) supramolecular photocatalyst tetraphenylporphinesulfonate/fullerene (TPPS/C60) is successfully constructed. The theoretical spectral efficiency of TPPS/C60 is as high as 70%, offering the possibility of full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. The TPPS/C60 performs a highly efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 276.55&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (34.57&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), surpassing many reported organic photocatalysts. The D&#8211;A structure effectively promotes electron transfer from TPPS to C60, which is beneficial to the photocatalytic reaction. Specifically, a giant internal electric field in the D&#8211;A structure is built via the enhanced molecular dipole, which dramatically promotes the charge separation (CS) efficiency by 2.35 times. Transient absorption spectra results show a long&#8208;lived CS state TPPS&#8226;+&#8211;C60&#8226;&#8722; in the D&#8211;A structure, which effectively promotes participation of photogenerated electrons in the reduction reaction. Briefly, this work provides a novel approach for designing high&#8208;performance photocatalytic materials via enhancing the interfacial electric field.

         <title>Upcycling to Sustainably Reuse Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plastics are mixed blessings that are convenient to our&#160;daily lives but have created a major environmental crisis. There are growing calls worldwide to reduce consumption, reuse more, recycle, and upcycle plastics. However, reducing, reusing, and recycling delay, rather than overcome the plastics problem. Here, more sustainable alternative approaches and technologies for plastics upcycling are reviewed.








Abstract
Plastics are now indispensable in daily lives. However, the pollution from plastics is also increasingly becoming a serious environmental issue. Recent years have seen more sustainable approaches and technologies, commonly known as upcycling, to transform plastics into value&#8208;added materials and chemical feedstocks. In this review, the latest research on upcycling is presented, with a greater focus on the use of renewable energy as well as the more selective methods to repurpose synthetic polymers. First, thermal upcycling approaches are briefly introduced, including the redeployment of plastics for construction uses, 3D printing precursors, and lightweight materials. Then, some of the latest novel strategies to deconstruct condensation polymers to monomers for repolymerization or introduce vulnerable linkers to make the plastics more degradable are discussed. Subsequently, the review will explore the breakthroughs in plastics upcycling by heterogeneous and homogeneous photocatalysis, as well as electrocatalysis, which transform plastics into more versatile fine chemicals and materials while simultaneously mitigating global climate change. In addition, some of the biotechnological advances in the discovery and engineering of microbes that can decompose plastics are also presented. Finally, the current challenges and outlook for future plastics upcycling are discussed to stimulate global cooperation in this field.

         <title>Ultrafast Electron Tunneling Devices&#8212;From Electric&#8208;Field Driven to Optical&#8208;Field Driven</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast electron tunneling devices are summarized here. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based transport electron devices, electron tunneling devices can provide significantly much faster response time due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs on femtosecond timescales. The central tenet of optical&#8208;field&#8208;driven tunneling devices is realizing sub&#8208;optical&#8208;cycle response lightwave electronics.








Abstract
The search for ever higher frequency information processing has become an area of intense research activity within the micro, nano, and optoelectronics communities. Compared to conventional semiconductor&#8208;based diffusive transport electron devices, electron tunneling devices provide significantly faster response times due to near&#8208;instantaneous tunneling that occurs at sub&#8208;femtosecond timescales. As a result, the enhanced performance of electron tunneling devices is demonstrated, time and again, to reimagine a wide variety of traditional electronic devices with a variety of new &#8220;lightwave electronics&#8221; emerging, each capable of reducing the electron transport channel transit time down to attosecond timescales. In response to unprecedented rapid progress within this field, here the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in electron tunneling devices is reviewed, current challenges and opportunities are highlighted, and possible future research directions are identified.

         <title>Translation of Collagen Ultrastructure to Biomaterial Fabrication for Material&#8208;Independent but Highly Efficient Topographic Immunomodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen I fibrils are found to exhibit unprecedented topographic immunomodulatory effects on human macrophages equal in intensity to the established interleukin&#8208;4&#8208;based biochemical induction. Employing melt electrofibrillation, a printing technique that allows the fabrication of collagen&#8208;fibril&#8208;mimetic nanofibrillar microbundles, it is demonstrated that this strong immunomodulatory effect is purely topographic and can be translated to synthetic materials.








Abstract
Supplement&#8208;free induction of cellular differentiation and polarization solely through the topography of materials is an auspicious strategy but has so far significantly lagged behind the efficiency and intensity of media&#8208;supplementation&#8208;based protocols. Consistent with the idea that 3D&#160;structural motifs in the extracellular matrix possess immunomodulatory capacity as part of the natural healing process, it is found in this study that human&#8208;monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages show a strong M2a&#8208;like prohealing polarization when cultured on type I rat&#8208;tail collagen fibers but not on collagen I films. Therefore, it is hypothesized that highly aligned nanofibrils also of synthetic polymers, if packed into larger bundles in 3D topographical biomimetic similarity to native collagen I, would induce a localized macrophage polarization. For the automated fabrication of such bundles in a 3D printing manner, the strategy of &#8220;melt electrofibrillation&#8221; is pioneered by the integration of flow&#8208;directed polymer phase separation into melt electrowriting and subsequent selective dissolution of the matrix polymer postprocessing. This process yields nanofiber bundles with a remarkable structural similarity to native collagen I fibers, particularly for medical&#8208;grade poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone). These biomimetic fibrillar structures indeed induce a pronounced elongation of human&#8208;monocyte&#8208;derived macrophages and unprecedentedly trigger their M2&#8208;like polarization similar in efficacy as interleukin&#8208;4 treatment.

         <title>Ultrathin Surface Coating of Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Graphene Enables Stable Zinc Anodes for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett approach is used to construct an ultrathin and parallel nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene protective layer on zinc (Zn) foil. The artificial interfacial film regulates the directional deposition of metallic Zn and inhibits the side reactions, thus achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Owing to the high volumetric capacity and low redox potential, zinc (Zn) metal is considered to be a remarkably prospective anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, dendrite growth severely destabilizes the electrode/electrolyte interface, and accelerates the generation of side reactions, which eventually degrade the electrochemical performance. Here, an artificial interface film of nitrogen (N)&#8208;doped graphene oxide (NGO) is one&#8208;step synthesized by a Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett method to achieve a parallel and ultrathin interface modification layer (&#8776;120&#160;nm) on Zn foil. The directional deposition of Zn crystal in the (002) planes is revealed because of the parallel graphene layer and beneficial zincophilic&#8208;traits of the N&#8208;doped groups. Meanwhile, through the in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and in situ Raman tests, the directional plating morphology of metallic Zn at the interface effectively suppresses the hydrogen evolution reactions and passivation. Consequently, the pouch cells pairing this new anode with LiMn2O4 cathode maintain exceptional energy density (164&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 after 178 cycles) at a reasonable depth of discharge, 36%. This work provides an accessible synthesis method and in&#8208;depth mechanistic analysis to accelerate the application of high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy AZIBs.

         <title>Integrating Single Atoms with Different Microenvironments into One Porous Organic Polymer for Efficient Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single metal sites with &#8211;N4 and &#8211;N2O2 coordination mode simultaneously incorporated into one porous organic backbone are reported. With the assistance of experimental results and theoretical calculations, the &#8211;N2O2 coordinated single metal sites are identified with higher catalytic activity toward CO2 photoreduction compared to that of traditional &#8211;N4 coordinated one.








Abstract
The precise identification of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) activity and boosting their efficiency toward CO2 conversion is imperative yet quite challenging. Herein, for the first time a series of porous organic polymers is designed and prepared simultaneously, containing well&#8208;defined M&#8211;N4 and M&#8211;N2O2 single&#8208;atom sites. Such a strategy not only offers multiactive sites to promote the catalytic efficiency but also provides a more direct chance to identify the metal center activity. The CO2 photoreduction results indicate that the introduction of salphen unit with Ni&#8211;N2O2 catalytic centers into pristine phthalocyanine&#8208;based Ni&#8211;N4 framework achieves remarkable CO generation ability (7.77&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8211;1) with a high selectivity of 96% over H2. In combination with control experiments, as well as theoretical studies, the Ni&#8211;N2O2 moiety is evidenced as a more active site for CO2RR compared with the traditional Ni&#8211;N4 moiety, which can be ascribed to the M&#8211;N2O2 active sites effectively reducing the energy barrier, facilitating the adsorption of reaction radicals *COOH, and improving the charge transportation. This work might shed some light on designing more efficient SACs toward CO2 reduction through modification of their coordination environments.

         <title>Recent Progress in External&#8208;Stimulus&#8208;Responsive 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent process of stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is summarized. The responsive behaviors and design strategies of these smart 2D COFs under physical or chemical stimuli are well described. Moreover, their applications in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Recently, smart 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), combining the advantages of both inherent structure features and functional building blocks, have been demonstrated to show reversible changes in conformation, color, and luminescence in response to external stimuli. This review provides a summary on the recent progress of 2D COFs that are responsive to external stimuli such as metal ions, gas molecules, pH values, temperature, electricity, light, etc. Moreover, the responsive mechanisms and design strategies, along with the applications of these stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed. It is believed that this review would provide some guidelines for designing novel single&#8208;/multistimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs with controllable responsive behaviors for advanced photoelectronic applications.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Capacitive Sensors with Different Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advantages, disadvantages, and practical applications of several popular microstructures that are widely employed in capacitive sensors are summarized. The microstructured dielectric layer or electrode can improve sensor sensitivity, reduce hysteresis, and endow the rigid electronic device with excellent elastic stretchability, which is an essential part of the next&#8208;generation wearable devices and soft robots.








Abstract
Recently, sensors that can imitate human skin have received extensive attention. Capacitive sensors have a simple structure, low loss, no temperature drift, and other excellent properties, and can be applied in the fields of robotics, human&#8211;machine interactions, medical care, and health monitoring. Polymer matrices are commonly employed in flexible capacitive sensors because of their high flexibility. However, their volume is almost unchanged when pressure is applied, and they are inherently viscoelastic. These shortcomings severely lead to high hysteresis and limit the improvement in sensitivity. Therefore, considerable efforts have been applied to improve the sensing performance by designing different microstructures of materials. Herein, two types of sensors based on the applied forces are discussed, including pressure sensors and strain sensors. Currently, five types of microstructures are commonly used in pressure sensors, while four are used in strain sensors. The advantages, disadvantages, and practical values of the different structures are systematically elaborated. Finally, future perspectives of microstructures for capacitive sensors are discussed, with the aim of providing a guide for designing advanced flexible and stretchable capacitive sensors via ingenious human&#8208;made microstructures.

         <title>Rational Design of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts: From Theoretical Understandings to Practical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle and theoretical understanding of single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), followed by representative synthesis strategies and their electrocatalytic applications in the oxygen reduction reaction, water dissociation, oxidation of small organic molecules, the nitrogen reduction reaction, and the carbon dioxide reduction reaction, are systematically reviewed, followed by representative synthesis strategies and their electrocatalytic applications in oxygen reduction reaction, water dissociation, oxidation of small organic molecules, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted increasing attention due to their nearly 100% atomic utilization and excellent catalytic performance. However, current fundamental comprehension and summaries to reveal the underlying relationship between single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) and corresponding catalytic application are rarely reported. Herein, the fundamental understandings and intrinsic mechanisms underlying SACs and corresponding electrocatalytic applications are systemically summarized. Different preparation strategies are presented to reveal the synthetic strategies with engineering the well&#8208;defined SACs on the basis of theoretical principle (size effect, metal&#8211;support interactions, electronic structure effect, and coordination environment effect). Then, an overview of the electrocatalytic applications is presented, including oxygen reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxidation of small organic molecules, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. The underlying structure&#8211;performance relationship between SACs and electrocatalytic reactions is also discussed in depth to expound the enhancement mechanisms. Finally, a summary is provided and a perspective supplied to demonstrate the current challenges and opportunities for rational designing, synthesizing, and modulating the advanced SACs toward electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Ice Templating Soft Matter: Fundamental Principles and Fabrication Approaches to Tailor Pore Structure and Morphology and Their Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ice templating is a simple, accessible, and scalable technique for the fabrication of porous materials. It allows control over pore morphology by controlling ice formation in a material solution, suspension, or slurry. This review describes fundamental principles, fabrication and characterization approaches, and biomedical applications of ice templating in polymer&#8208;based biomaterials.








Abstract
Porous scaffolds are widely used in biomedical applications where pore size and morphology influence a range of biological processes, including mass transfer of solutes, cellular interactions and organization, immune responses, and tissue vascularization, as well as drug delivery from biomaterials. Ice templating, one of the most widely utilized techniques for the fabrication of porous materials, allows control over pore morphology by controlling ice formation in a suspension of solutes. By fine&#8208;tuning freezing and solute parameters, ice templating can be used to incorporate pores with tunable morphological features into a wide range of materials using a simple, accessible, and scalable process. While soft matter is widely ice templated for biomedical applications and includes commercial and clinical products, the principles underpinning its ice templating are not reviewed as well as their inorganic counterparts. This review describes and critically evaluates fundamental principles, fabrication and characterization approaches, and biomedical applications of ice templating in polymer&#8208;based biomaterials. It describes the utility of porous scaffolds in biomedical applications, highlighting biological mechanisms impacted by pore features, outlines the physical and thermodynamic mechanisms underpinning ice templating, describes common fabrication setups, critically evaluates complexities of ice templating specific to polymers, and discusses future directions in this field.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Droplet microfluidics is facilitated to engineer liquid proteinaceous materials of controllable size and dispersity at the microscale, through all&#8208;aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The protein condensates are highlighted by their morphological evolution, fusion, and the diffusion of nano/microspheres in the materials, which would have implications in temperature sensing, drug delivery, and tissue engineering for healthcare.








Abstract
Liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated biomolecular systems are increasingly recognized as key components in the intracellular milieu where they provide spatial organization to the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm. The widespread use of phase&#8208;separated systems by nature has given rise to the inspiration of engineering such functional systems in the laboratory. In particular, reversible gelation of liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated systems could confer functional advantages to the generation of new soft materials. Such gelation processes of biomolecular condensates have been extensively studied due to their links with disease. However, the inverse process, the gel&#8211;sol transition, has been less explored. Here, a thermoresponsive gel&#8211;sol transition of an extracellular protein in microgel form is explored, resulting in an all&#8208;aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated system with high homogeneity. During this gel&#8211;sol transition, elongated gelatin microgels are demonstrated to be converted to a spherical geometry due to interfacial tension becoming the dominant energetic contribution as elasticity diminishes. The phase&#8208;separated system is&#160;further explored with respect to the diffusion of small particles for drug&#8208;release scenarios. Together, this all&#8208;aqueous system opens up a route toward size&#8208;tunable and monodisperse synthetic biomolecular condensates and controlled liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces, offering possibilities for applications in bioengineering and biomedicine.

         <title>General Design Concept for Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts toward Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development and exploration of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is of enormous significance for achieving industrialization. The advanced progress of precise synthesis and practical application of SACs is summarized. Thereafter, the main challenges and future opportunities of large&#8208;scale synthesis of SACs are discussed.








Abstract
As a new and popular material, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent activity, selectivity, and stability for numerous important reactions, and show great potential in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high atom utilization efficiency and the controllable characteristics of the active sites. The composition and coordination would determine the geometric and electronic structures of SACs, and thus greatly influence the catalytic performance. Based on atom economy, rational design and controllable synthesis of SACs have become central tasks in the fields of low&#8208;cost and green catalysis. Herein, an introduction to the recent progress in the precise synthesis of SACs including the regulation of the coordination structure and the choice of different systems is presented. Thereafter, the potentials of SACs in different applications are comprehensively summarized and discussed. Furthermore, a detailed discussion of the recent developments regarding the large&#8208;scale preparation of SACs is provided, including the major issues and prospects for industrialization. Finally, the main challenges and opportunities of rapid large&#8208;scale industrialization of SACs are briefly discussed.

         <title>T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Derived Nanovesicles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
T&#8208;cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles (TCNVs) are produced from activated CD8+ T cells for cancer immunotherapeutics. TCNVs exhibit inhibition of solid tumor growth through blocking immunosuppressive molecules in the tumor microenvironment, aiding to maintain the cytotoxic T cells&#8217; antitumor activity. Moreover, TCNVs kill tumor cells directly. Therefore, TCNV offers an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy to overcome the solid tumor's immunosuppressive mechanisms.








Abstract
Although T&#8208;cell therapy is a remarkable breakthrough in cancer immunotherapy, the therapeutic efficacy is limited for solid tumors. A major cause of the low efficacy is T&#8208;cell exhaustion by immunosuppressive mechanisms of solid tumors, which are mainly mediated by programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) and transforming growth factor&#8208;beta (TGF&#8208;&#946;). Herein, T&#8208;cell&#8208;derived nanovesicles (TCNVs) produced by the serial extrusion of cytotoxic T cells through membranes with micro&#8208;/nanosized pores that inhibit T&#8208;cell exhaustion and exhibit antitumoral activity maintained in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) are presented. TCNVs, which have programmed cell death protein 1 and TGF&#8208;&#946; receptor on their surface, block PD&#8208;L1 on cancer cells and scavenge TGF&#8208;&#946; in the immunosuppressive TME, thereby preventing cytotoxic&#8208;T&#8208;cell exhaustion. In addition, TCNVs directly kill cancer cells via granzyme B delivery. TCNVs successfully suppress tumor growth in syngeneic&#8208;solid&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Taken together, TCNV offers an effective cancer immunotherapy strategy to overcome the tumor's immunosuppressive mechanisms.

         <title>Polymeric Aggregate&#8208;Embodied Hybrid Nitric&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Scavenging and Sequential Drug&#8208;Releasing Hydrogel for Combinatorial Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric aggregate&#8208;embodied hybrid hydrogel is presented that rapidly gelates in situ via a &#8220;click&#8221; cycloaddition reaction and shows promising properties for the combinatorial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, including nitric oxide scavenging, on&#8208;demand dual&#8208;stage drug releasing, and self&#8208;healing capabilities.








Abstract
Selective depletion of overproduced nitric oxide (NO) with nanoscavengers is a promising approach for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA), preventing both oxidative/nitrosative stress and the upregulation of immune cells. However, its practical applications are limited owing to the minimum time interval between intra&#8208;articular injections and unwanted off&#8208;target NO depletion. Herein, the rational design of an injectable in situ polymeric aggregate&#8208;embodied hybrid NO&#8208;scavenging and sequential drug&#8208;releasing (M&#8208;NO) gel platform for the combinatorial treatment of RA by incorporating a &#8220;clickable&#8221; NO&#8208;cleavable cross&#8208;linker (DA&#8208;NOCCL) is reported. This network is held together with polymeric aggregates to achieve a self&#8208;healing capability for visco&#8208;supplementation and on&#8208;demand dual drug (both hydrophilic and hydrophobic)&#8208;releasing properties, depending on the NO concentration. Moreover, consecutive NO&#8208;scavenging action reduces pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokine levels in lipopolysaccharides&#8208;stimulated macrophage cell lines in vitro. Finally, the intra&#8208;articularly injected M&#8208;NO gel with anti&#8208;inflammatory dexamethasone significantly alleviates the symptoms of RA, with negligible toxicity, in animal models. It is believed that this novel M&#8208;NO gel platform will provide a guideline for the combinatorial treatment of RA and various NO&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Doping and Synergism toward High&#8208;Performance Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrahigh activity and selectivity seawater electrolyzer with robust stability is developed via a dual&#8208;doping and synergism optimization of Fe,P&#8208;NiSe2 nanoporous films. The Fe cation increases the selectivity and Faraday efficiency, while the P anion improves the electronic conductivity and prevents the dissolution of selenide.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) production from direct seawater electrolysis is an economically appealing yet fundamentally and technically challenging approach to harvest clean energy. The current seawater electrolysis technology is significantly hindered by the poor stability and low selectivity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the competition with chlorine evolution reaction in practical application. Herein, iron and phosphor dual&#8208;doped nickel selenide nanoporous films (Fe,P&#8208;NiSe2 NFs) are rationally designed as bifunctional catalysts for high&#8208;efficiency direct seawater electrolysis. The doping of Fe cation increases the selectivity and Faraday efficiency (FE) of the OER. While the doping of P anions improves the electronic conductivity and prevents the dissolution of selenide by forming a passivation layer containing P&#8211;O species. The Fe&#8208;dopant is identified as the primary active site for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and meanwhile, stimulates the adjacent Ni atoms as active centers for the OER. The experimental analyses and theoretical calculations provide an insightful understanding of the roles of dual&#8208;dopants in boosting seawater electrolysis. As a result, a current density of 0.8 A cm&#8722;2 is archived at 1.8 V with high OER selectivity and long&#8208;term stability for over 200 h, which surpasses the benchmarking platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals&#8208;free electrolyzers.

         <title>Evolving Highly Active Oxidic Iron(III) Phase from Corrosion of Intermetallic Iron Silicide to Master Efficient Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation and Selective Oxygenation of 5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural</title>

         <dc:description>
The application of iron for oxidizing electrocatalytic reactions is limited due to the low conductivity of FeIIIOxHy phases. Using the second most abundant element of the Earth's crust, silicon, intermetallic FeSi is formed, which is demonstrated to drive the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.50&#160;&#177;&#160;0.025&#160;VRHE&#160;and 65&#160;&#176;C), as well as selectively oxygenate 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).








Abstract
In a green energy economy, electrocatalysis is essential for chemical energy conversion and to produce value added chemicals from regenerative resources. To be widely applicable, an electrocatalyst should comprise the Earth's crust's most abundant elements. The most abundant 3d metal, iron, with its multiple accessible redox states has been manifold applied in chemocatalytic processes. However, due to the low conductivity of FeIIIOxHy phases, its applicability for targeted electrocatalytic oxidation reactions such as water oxidation is still limited. Herein, it is shown that iron incorporated in conductive intermetallic iron silicide (FeSi) can be employed to meet this challenge. In contrast to silicon&#8208;poor iron&#8211;silicon alloys, intermetallic FeSi possesses an ordered structure with a peculiar bonding situation including covalent and ionic contributions together with conducting electrons. Using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption and Raman spectroscopy, it could be demonstrated that, under the applied corrosive alkaline conditions, the FeSi partly forms a unique, oxidic iron(III) phase consisting of edge and corner sharing [FeO6] octahedra together with oxidized silicon species. This phase is capable of driving the oxyge evolution reaction (OER) at high efficiency under ambient and industrially relevant conditions (500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.50&#160;&#177;&#160;0.025&#160;VRHE and 65&#160;&#176;C) and to selectively oxygenate 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).

         <title>Engineering of Microcage Carbon Nanotube Architectures with Decoupled Multimodal Porosity and Amplified Catalytic Performance</title>

         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;templating of 1D carbon nanostructures provides next&#8208;generation nanocarbon aerogels with unique microcage internal architectures and independently tuneable micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macroporosities. The intricate aerogel microstructures are chemically modified with metal nanoparticles (Cu, Pd, Ru) through a structure&#8208;preserving sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition functionalization approach. The subsequent nanoparticle&#8208;decorated aerogels exhibit amplified catalytic performance, as well as solvent&#8208;induced shape&#8208;recovery behavior.








Abstract
New approaches for the engineering of the 3D microstructure, pore modality, and chemical functionality of hierarchically porous nanocarbon assemblies are key to develop the next generation of functional aerogel and membrane materials. Here, interfacially driven assembly of carbon nanotubes (CNT) is exploited to fabricate structurally directed aerogels with highly controlled internal architectures, composed of pseudo&#8208;monolayer, CNT microcages. CNT Pickering emulsions enable engineering at fundamentally different length scales, whereby the microporosity, mesoporosity, and macroporosity are decoupled and individually controlled through CNT type, CNT number density, and process energy, respectively. In addition, metal nanocatalysts (Cu, Pd, and Ru) are embedded within the architectures through an elegant sublimation and shock&#8208;decomposition approach; introducing the first approach that enables through&#8208;volume functionalization of intricate, pre&#8208;designed aerogels without microstructural degradation. Catalytic structure&#8211;function relationships are explored in a pharma&#8208;important amidation reaction; providing insights on how the engineered frameworks enhance catalyst activity. A sophisticated array of advanced tomographic, spectroscopic, and microscopic techniques reveal an intricate 3D assembly of CNT building&#8208;blocks and their influence on the functional properties of the enhanced nanocatalysts. These advances set a basis to modulate structure and chemistry of functional aerogel materials independently in a controlled fashion for a variety of applications, including energy conversion and storage, smart electronics, and (electro)catalysis.

         <title>Innervated, Self&#8208;Sensing Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators with Closed Loop Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing, innervated liquid crystal elastomers in both fiber and square spiral motifs (shown) are produced by core&#8211;shell 3D printing. The printed core&#8211;shell filaments consist of a liquid metal core surrounded by a liquid crystal elastomer shell. When Joule heated above their nematic&#8208;to&#8208;isotropic transition temperature, these self&#8208;sensing architectures exhibit actuation and large work output, which can be regulated via closed loop control.

Abstract
The programmable assembly of innervated LCE actuators (iLCEs) with prescribed contractile actuation, self&#8208;sensing, and closed loop control via core&#8211;shell 3D printing is reported. This extrusion&#8208;based direct ink writing method enables coaxial filamentary features composed of pure LM core surrounded by an LCE shell, whose director is aligned along the print path. Specifically, the thermal response of the iLCE fiber&#8208;type actuators is programmed, measured, and modeled during Joule heating, including quantifying the concomitant changes in fiber length and resistance that arise during simultaneous heating and self&#8208;sensing. Due to their reversible, high&#8208;energy actuation and their resistive feedback, it is also demonstrated that iLCEs can be regulated with closed loop control even when perturbed with large bias loads. Finally, iLCE architectures capable of programmed, self&#8208;sensing 3D shape change with closed loop control are fabricated.

         <title>Electric&#8208;Field Control of Propagating Spin Waves by Ferroelectric Domain&#8208;Wall Motion in a Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electric&#8208;field control of propagating spin waves in an Fe/BaTiO3 multiferroic heterostructure is demonstrated experimentally. The underlying mechanism involves the concurrent motion of strain&#8208;coupled ferroelectric domain walls and magnetic anisotropy boundaries and allows reversible tuning of the spin&#8208;wave amplitude and phase. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable magnonics.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic heterostructures offers a promising platform for electric&#8208;field control of magnonic devices based on low&#8208;power spin&#8208;wave transport. Here, electric&#8208;field manipulation of the amplitude and phase of propagating spin waves in a ferromagnetic Fe film on top of a ferroelectric BaTiO3 substrate is demonstrated experimentally. Electric&#8208;field effects in this composite material system are mediated by strain coupling between alternating ferroelectric stripe domains with in&#8208;plane and perpendicular polarization and fully correlated magnetic anisotropy domains with differing spin&#8208;wave transport properties. The propagation of spin waves across the strain&#8208;induced magnetic anisotropy domains of the Fe film is directly imaged and it is shown how reversible electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven motion of ferroelectric domain walls and pinned anisotropy boundaries turns the spin&#8208;wave signal on and off. Furthermore, linear electric&#8208;field tuning of the spin&#8208;wave phase by altering the width of strain&#8208;coupled stripe domains is demonstrated. The results provide a new route toward energy&#8208;efficient reconfigurable&#160;magnonics.

A harmless&#8211;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is designed as a chemodynamic therapy (CDT) agent, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) generation and possesses harmless&#8211;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger Fe&#8208;chlorin e6, showing great potential as a safe and effective CDT agent.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) employs Fenton catalysts to kill cancer cells by converting intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into hydroxyl radicals (OH&#8226;). Although many studies on H2O2 supplementation have been conducted to improve the therapeutic effect of CDT, few studies have focused on the application of superoxide radical (O2&#8722;&#8226;) in CDT, which may result in better efficacy. A major concern about O2&#8722;&#8226;&#8208;mediated CDT is its tendency to induce serious oxidative damage to normal tissues, which may be addressed by using a degradable O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger. Here, a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable and uninterrupted laccase (LAC)&#8208;instructed killer (HULK) is constructed, which is the first CDT agent accelerated by LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation and possesses a harmless&#8208;harmful switchable effect because of the photodegradation of the O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger iron&#8208;chlorin e6 (FeCe6). LAC&#8208;instructed substrate oxidation effectively catalyzes O2&#8722;&#8226; production with the help of intracellular reduction, thereby promoting the conversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+, accelerating the generation of OH&#8226;, and inducing tumor cell apoptosis and necrosis. The introduced O2&#8722;&#8226; scavenger FeCe6 is quickly photodegraded during irradiation, while LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation proceeds as before, resulting in activatable CDT. This work not only provides the first strategy for LAC&#8208;instructed O2&#8722;&#8226; generation but also presents new insight into activatable CDT.

         <title>40.1% Record Low&#8208;Light Solar&#8208;Cell Efficiency by Holistic Trap&#8208;Passivation using Micrometer&#8208;Thick Perovskite Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The involvement of guanidinium in perovskite bulk film and CH3O&#8208;PEABr passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of perovskite films increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981 ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a record efficiency of 40.1%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells exhibit not only high efficiency under full AM1.5 sunlight, but also have great potential for applications in low&#8208;light environments, such as indoors, cloudy conditions, early morning, late evening, etc. Unfortunately, their performance still suffers from severe trap&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination, particularly under low&#8208;light conditions. Here, a holistic passivation strategy is developed to reduce traps both on the surface and in the bulk of micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film, leading to a record efficiency of 40.1% under 301.6 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 warm light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) light for low&#8208;light solar&#8208;cell applications. The involvement of guanidinium into the perovskite bulk film and 2&#8208;(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl)ethylamine hydrobromide (CH3O&#8208;PEABr) passivation on the perovskite surface synergistically suppresses the trap states. The charge carrier lifetimes of the perovskite film increase by tenfold and fivefold to 981&#160;ns and 8.02 &#181;s at the crystal surface and in its bulk, respectively. The decreased nonradiative recombination loss translates to a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.00&#160;V, a high short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc) of 152.10 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.52%. Note that this performance also stands as the highest among all photovoltaics measured under indoor light illumination. This work of trap passivation for micrometer&#8208;thick perovskite film paves a way for high&#8208;performance, self&#8208;powered IoT devices.

         <title>Bubble Forming Films for Spatial Selective Cell Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymeric films embedding iron oxide nanoparticles as photosensitizers are designed. Irradiation of the films with pulsed&#8208;laser light generates water vapor bubbles at their surface. Cells located close to the films can be killed due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial and selective single cell killing at the surface of the eye.








Abstract
Photodynamic and photothermal cell killing at the surface of tissues finds applications in medicine. However, a lack of control over heat dissipation following a treatment with light might damage surrounding tissues. A new strategy to kill cells at the surface of tissues is reported. Polymeric films are designed in which iron oxide nanoparticles are embedded as photosensitizers. Irradiation of the films with pulsed laser light generates water vapor bubbles at the surface of the films. It is found that &#8220;bubble&#8208;films&#8221; can kill cells in close proximity to the films due to mechanical forces which arise when the bubbles collapse. Local irradiation of bubble&#8208;films allows for spatial selective single cell killing. As nanosurgery becomes attractive in ophthalmology to remove superficial tumors, bubble&#8208;films are applied on the cornea and it is found that irradiation of the bubble&#8208;films allows spatial and selective killing of corneal cells. As i) the photosensitizer is embedded in the films, which reduces its uptake by cells and spreading into tissues and ii) the bubble&#8208;films can be removed from the tissue after laser treatment, while iii) a low laser fluence is sufficient to generate vapor bubbles, it is foreseen that bubble&#8208;films might become promising for safe resection of superficial tumors.

         <title>Repurposing Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) as a Conductivity&#8208;Reducing Additive for Polyethylene&#8208;Based High&#8208;Voltage Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conjugated polymer poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is used as a conductivity&#8208;reducing additive for low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE). An ultralow amount of only 0.0005 wt% of P3HT decreases the electrical conductivity of LDPE threefold, which may facilitate the design of better insulation materials for high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current power cables.








Abstract
Poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is found to be a highly effective conductivity&#8208;reducing additive for low&#8208;density polyethylene (LDPE), which introduces a new application area to the field of conjugated polymers. Additives that reduce the direct&#8208;current (DC) electrical conductivity of an insulation material at high electric fields have gained a lot of research interest because they may facilitate the design of more efficient high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current power cables. An ultralow concentration of regio&#8208;regular P3HT of 0.0005 wt% is found to reduce the DC conductivity of LDPE threefold, which translates into the highest efficiency reported for any conductivity&#8208;reducing additive to date. The here&#8208;established approach, i.e., the use of a conjugated polymer as a mere additive, may boost demand in absolute terms beyond the quantities needed for thin&#8208;film electronics, which would turn organic semiconductors from a niche product into commodity chemicals.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Hybrid Dielectric for Capacitive and Triboelectric Tactile Sensors with High Sensitivity and Ultrawide Linearity Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired hybrid dielectric with gradient compressibility and dielectric property is presented based on a combined low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array and high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface and micro&#8208;dome array. The derived linear elastic modulus and effective dielectric constant enable an ultrawide linear sensing range (0&#8211;1000&#160;kPa) and enhanced sensitivity for capacitive/triboelectric tactile sensors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between sensitivity and linearity is critical for preserving the high pressure&#8208;resolution over a broad range and simplifying the signal processing/conversion of flexible tactile sensors. Conventional dielectrics suffer from the difficulty of quantitatively controlling the interacted mechanical and dielectric properties, thus causing the restricted sensitivity and linearity of capacitive sensors. Herein, inspired by human skin, a novel hybrid dielectric composed of a low&#8208;permittivity (low&#8208;k) micro&#8208;cilia array, a high&#8208;permittivity (high&#8208;k) rough surface, and micro&#8208;dome array is developed. The pressure&#8208;induced series&#8208;parallel conversion between the low&#8208;k and high&#8208;k components of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear effective dielectric constant and controllable initial/resultant capacitance. The gradient compressibility of the hybrid dielectric enables the linear behavior of elastic modulus with pressures, which derives the capacitance variation determined by the effective dielectric constant. Therefore, an ultrawide linearity range up to 1000&#160;kPa and a high sensitivity of 0.314 kPa&#8211;1 are simultaneously achieved by the optimized hybrid dielectric. The design is also applicable for triboelectric tactile sensors, which realizes the similar linear behavior of output voltage and enhanced sensitivity. With the high pressure&#8208;resolution across a broad range, potential applications such as healthcare monitoring in diverse scenarios and control command conversion via a single sensor are demonstrated.

         <title>Active Control of Nanodielectric&#8208;Induced THz Quasi&#8208;BIC in Flexible Metasurfaces: A Platform for Modulation and Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple strategy for introducing and engineering narrow and active resonances in metamaterials is demonstrated. A nanoscale&#8208;thick semiconducting strip breaks the structure's symmetry, providing access to a quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (quasi&#8208;BIC) that can be modulated with light. Inverse design of such resonances and their potential for ultrafast terahertz switchable filters and sensors are demonstrated.








Abstract
A bound state in the continuum (BIC) is a nonradiating state of light embedded in the continuum of propagating modes providing drastic enhancement of the electromagnetic field and its localization at micro&#8211;nanoscale. However, access to such modes in the far&#8208;field requires symmetry breaking. Here, it is demonstrated that a nanometric dielectric or semiconductor layer, 1000&#160;times thinner than the resonant wavelength (&#955;/1000), induces a dynamically controllable quasi&#8208;bound state in the continuum (QBIC) with ultrahigh quality factor in a symmetric metallic metasurface at terahertz frequencies. Photoexcitation of nanostrips of germanium activates ultrafast switching of a QBIC resonance with 200% transmission intensity modulation and complete recovery within 7 ps on a low&#8208;loss flexible substrate. The nanostrips also form microchannels that provide an opportunity for BIC&#8208;based refractive index sensing. An optimization model is presented for (switchable) QBIC resonances of metamaterial arrays of planar symmetric resonators modified with any (active) dielectric for inverse metamaterial design that can serve as an enabling platform for active micro&#8211;nanophotonic devices.

         <title>Boosting CO2 Electroreduction via the Synergistic Effect of Tuning Cationic Clusters and Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic strategy is developed to improve the CO2RR intrinsic activity and selectivity via introducing Ti into the cluster and an external light field. The initial electron transfer to form *COO&#8722; can be facilitated thanks to the more exposed active sites and adjusted electron transfer pathway. This strategy provides a guidance to fabricate highly active and stable catalysts for CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Introducing an external light field can increase the intrinsic activity and energy efficiency for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Herein, a synergistic strategy that introduces photosensitive components and visible light into a stable system is reported to improve the performance for CO2 reduction. The catalytic kinetics studies indicate that the synergistic effect of implantation of cationic Ti and additional light driving is the primary responsibility for accelerating the first electron transfer to form a *COO&#8722; intermediate. This leads to a satisfactory CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion for Zr/Ti&#8208;NB&#8208;Co in terms of high selectivity (Faradaic efficiency of 93.6% at &#8722;0.7&#160;V), remarkable catalytic activity (production rate up to 546&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V), excellent long&#8208;term stability (without performance decay over 11 h), and large turnover frequency of 1028 h&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.1&#160;V under visible light. These results imply that the photodriven Ti&#8208;based porphyrin catalyst not only can deliver more electrons, but also can act as a photoswitch to adjust the electron transfer pathway.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with 18% Efficiency Enabled by an Alloy Acceptor: A Two&#8208;in&#8208;One Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; strategy is applied to form an acceptor alloy for fine&#8208;tuning the donor/acceptor energy alignment and blend morphology. Enhanced hole transfer and suppressed charge recombination in the alloy acceptor consisting of AQx&#8208;3 and Y6 enable a power conversion efficiency of over 18%, which is the highest documented for ternary organic solar cells utilizing two nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off between the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current density (Jsc) has become the core of current organic photovoltaic research, and realizing the minimum energy offsets that can guarantee effective charge generation is strongly desired for high&#8208;performance systems. Herein, a high&#8208;performance ternary solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of over 18% using a large&#8208;bandgap polymer donor, PM6, and a small&#8208;bandgap alloy acceptor containing two structurally similar nonfullerene acceptors (Y6 and AQx&#8208;3) is reported. This system can take full advantage of solar irradiation and forms a favorable morphology. By varying the ratio of the two acceptors, delicate regulation of the energy levels of the alloy acceptor is achieved, thereby affecting the charge dynamics in the devices. The optimal ternary device exhibits more efficient hole transfer and exciton separation than the PM6:AQx&#8208;3&#8208;based system and reduced energy loss compared with the PM6:Y6&#8208;based system, contributing to better performance. Such a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; alloy strategy, which synergizes two highly compatible acceptors, provides a promising path for boosting the photovoltaic performance of devices.

         <title>Assembly of Close&#8208;Packed Ferroelectric Polymer Nanowires via Interface&#8208;Epitaxy with ReS2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach is developed to achieve ferroelectric polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) thin films composed of close&#8208;packed crystalline nanowires with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar axis via interface&#8208;epitaxy with 1T&#8242;&#8208;ReS2, which leads to over six orders of magnitude higher ferroelectric field&#8208;effect modulation in ReS2 transistors and coercive voltages as low as 0.1&#160;V, making them viable for large&#8208;scale, low&#8208;power, high&#8208;performance device applications.








Abstract
The flexible, transparent, and low&#8208;weight nature of ferroelectric polymers makes them promising for wearable electronic and optical applications. To reach the full potential of the polarization&#8208;enabled device functionalities, large&#8208;scale fabrication of polymer thin films with well&#8208;controlled polar directions is called for, which remains a central challenge.

&lt;p&gt;A scalable approach is developed to achieve ferroelectric polymer P(VDF-TrFE) thin films composed of close-packed crystalline nanowires with out-of-plane polar axis via interface-epitaxy with 1T&#8242;-ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which leads to over six orders of magnitude higher ferroelectric field-effect modulation in ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transistors and coercive voltages as low as 0.1&#160;V, making them viable for large-scale, low-power, high-performance device applications.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flexible, transparent, and low-weight nature of ferroelectric polymers makes them promising for wearable electronic and optical applications. To reach the full potential of the polarization-enabled device functionalities, large-scale fabrication of polymer thin films with well-controlled polar directions is called for, which remains a central challenge. The widely exploited Langmuir&#8211;Blodgett, spin-coating, and electrospinning methods only yield polymorphous or polycrystalline films, where the net polarization is compromised. Here, an easily scalable approach is reported to achieve poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene) P(VDF-TrFE) thin films composed of close-packed crystalline nanowires via interface-epitaxy with 1T&#8242;-ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Upon controlled thermal treatment, uniform P(VDF-TrFE) films restructure into about 10 and 35 nm-wide (010)-oriented nanowires that are crystallographically aligned with the underlying ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, as revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Piezoresponse force microscopy studies confirm the out-of-plane polar axis of the nanowire films and reveal coercive voltages as low as 0.1 V. Reversing the polarization can induce a conductance switching ratio of &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; in bilayer ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, over six orders of magnitude higher than that achieved by an untreated polymer gate. This study points to a cost-effective route to large-scale processing of high-performance ferroelectric polymer thin films for flexible energy-efficient nanoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interfacial Trap&#8208;Assisted Triplet Generation in Lead Halide Perovskite Sensitized Solid&#8208;State Upconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of interfacial properties on charge&#8208;initiated triplet sensitization in perovskite&#8208;sensitized solid&#8208;state upconversion devices is investigated. Trap&#8208;assisted triplet sensitization is demonstrated via modification of interfacial trap densities of the devices through surface treatment while monitoring the upconversion performance. Devices with more interfacial traps show brighter upconversion, highlighting the importance of interfacial control in perovskite&#8208;sensitized upconversion devices.








Abstract
Photon upconversion via triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) has promise for overcoming the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit for single&#8208;junction solar cells by allowing the utilization of sub&#8208;bandgap photons. Recently, bulk perovskites have been employed as sensitizers in solid&#8208;state upconversion devices to circumvent poor exciton diffusion in previous nanocrystal (NC)&#8208;sensitized devices. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of the underlying photophysics of perovskite&#8208;sensitized triplet generation is still lacking due to the difficulty of precisely controlling interfacial properties of fully solution&#8208;processed devices. In this study, interfacial properties of upconversion devices are adjusted by a mild surface solvent treatment, specifically altering perovskite surface properties without perturbing the bulk perovskite. Thermal evaporation of the annihilator precludes further solvent contamination. Counterintuitively, devices with more interfacial traps show brighter upconversion. Approximately an order of magnitude difference in upconversion brightness is observed across different interfacial solvent treatments. Sequential charge transfer and interfacial trap&#8208;assisted triplet sensitization are demonstrated by comparing upconversion performance, transient photoluminescence dynamics, and magnetic field dependence of the devices. Incomplete triplet conversion from transferred charges and consequent triplet&#8208;charge annihilation (TCA) are also observed. The observations highlight the importance of interfacial control and provide guidance for further design and optimization of upconversion devices using perovskites or other semiconductors as sensitizers.

         <title>Traceable Nano&#8208;Biohybrid Complexes by One&#8208;Step Synthesis as CRISPR&#8208;Chem Vectors for Neurodegenerative Diseases Synergistic Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes are established by one&#8208;step synthesis to serve as CRISPR&#8208;chem drug vectors (CF&#8208;TBIO). The CRISPR/Cas9 tool and the chemical drug are employed to inhibit and eliminate abnormal protein aggregations related to neurodegenerative diseases. CF&#8208;TBIO facilitates accumulation of gene&#8208;chem drugs in brain lesions, reduces the burden of protein aggregations, and provides accurate imaging signals, having great potential for synergistic treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.








Abstract
Abnormal protein aggregations are essential pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Eliminating while inhibiting the regeneration of these protein aggregates is considered an effective treatment strategy. Herein, the CRISPR/Cas9 gene&#8208;editing tool is employed to inhibit the regeneration of disease&#8208;related proteins, while chemical drugs are applied to eliminate the proteins that are produced. To efficiently deliver CRISPR&#8208;chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano&#8208;biohybrid complexes (F&#8208;TBIO) are constructed by one&#8208;step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF&#8208;TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF&#8208;TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid&#8208;&#946;, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg&#8208;AD mice are still significantly improved. During the therapeutic process, CF&#8208;TBIO with a high relaxation rate provides accurate imaging signals in the complex brain physiological environment. The finding shows that CF&#8208;TBIO has great potential to serve as a CRISPR&#8208;chem drug&#8208;delivery platform for neurodegenerative diseases therapy.

         <title>Double&#8208;Gate MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors with Full&#8208;Range Tunable Threshold Voltage for Multifunctional Logic Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;gate MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistor is designed for potential applications in multifunctional reconfigurable logic circuits. Featuring the feasible tuning of threshold voltage and optimizing of subthreshold swing of the transistors, the system can both function well as full logic swing binary logic with high noise margin and be dynamically reconfigured between binary and ternary logic.








Abstract
Multifunctional reconfigurable devices, with higher information capacity, smaller size, and more functions, are urgently needed and draw most attention in frontiers in information technology. 2D semiconductors, ascribing to ultrathin body and easy electrostatic control, show great potential in developing reconfigurable functional units. This work proposes a novel double&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor architecture with equal top and bottom gate (TG and BG) and realizes flexible optimization of the subthreshold swing (SS) and threshold voltage (VTH). While the TG and BG are used simultaneously, as a single gate to drive the transistor, ultralow average SS value of 65.5 mV dec&#8722;1 can be obtained in a large current range over 104, enabling the application in high gain inverter. While one gate is used to initialize the channel doping, full logic swing inverter circuit with high noise margin (over 90%) is demonstrated. Such device prototype is further extended for designing reconfigurable logic applications and can be dynamically switched and well maintained between binary and ternary logics. This study provides important concept and device prototype for future multifunctional logic applications.

         <title>Healable and Recyclable Elastomers with Record&#8208;High Mechanical Robustness, Unprecedented Crack Tolerance, and Superhigh Elastic Restorability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healable and recyclable elastomers with superhigh strength (tensile strength &#8776; 75.6&#160;MPa, true stress at break &#8776; 1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (&#8776;390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) are reported. The elastomer has unprecedented crack tolerance with fracture energy of 215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2 that even exceeds that of metals and alloys. The elastomer exhibits superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times.








Abstract
Spider silk is one of the most robust natural materials, which has extremely high strength in combination with great toughness and good elasticity. Inspired by spider silk but beyond it, a healable and recyclable supramolecular elastomer, possessing superhigh true stress at break (1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (390.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), which are, respectively, comparable to and &#8776;2.4 times higher than those of typical spider silk, is developed. The elastomer has the highest tensile strength (ultimate engineering stress, 75.6&#160;MPa) ever recorded for polymeric elastomers, rendering it the strongest and toughest healable elastomer thus far. The hyper&#8208;robust elastomer exhibits superb crack tolerance with unprecedentedly high fracture energy (215.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) that even exceeds that of metals and alloys, and superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times. These extraordinary mechanical performances mainly originate from the meticulously engineered hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, consisting of multiple acylsemicarbazide and urethane moieties linked with flexible alicyclic hexatomic spacers. Such hydrogen&#8208;bonding segments, incorporated between extensible polymer chains, aggregate to form geometrically confined hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays resembling those in spider silk. The hydrogen&#8208;bond arrays act as firm but reversible crosslinks and sacrificial bonds for enormous energy dissipation, conferring exceptional mechanical robustness, healability, and recyclability on the elastomer.

The elastomer has unprecedented crack tolerance with fracture energy of 215.2&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; that even exceeds that of metals and alloys. The elastomer exhibits superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spider silk is one of the most robust natural materials, which has extremely high strength in combination with great toughness and good elasticity. Inspired by spider silk but beyond it, a healable and recyclable supramolecular elastomer, possessing superhigh true stress at break (1.21&#160;GPa) and ultrahigh toughness (390.2&#160;MJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which are, respectively, comparable to and &#8776;2.4 times higher than those of typical spider silk, is developed. The elastomer has the highest tensile strength (ultimate engineering stress, 75.6&#160;MPa) ever recorded for polymeric elastomers, rendering it the strongest and toughest healable elastomer thus far. The hyper-robust elastomer exhibits superb crack tolerance with unprecedentedly high fracture energy (215.2&#160;kJ m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) that even exceeds that of metals and alloys, and superhigh elastic restorability allowing dimensional recovery from elongation over 12 times. These extraordinary mechanical performances mainly originate from the meticulously engineered hydrogen-bonding segments, consisting of multiple acylsemicarbazide and urethane moieties linked with flexible alicyclic hexatomic spacers. Such hydrogen-bonding segments, incorporated between extensible polymer chains, aggregate to form geometrically confined hydrogen-bond arrays resembling those in spider silk. The hydrogen-bond arrays act as firm but reversible crosslinks and sacrificial bonds for enormous energy dissipation, conferring exceptional mechanical robustness, healability, and recyclability on the elastomer.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered MXene/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction Ultraviolet Photodiodes with Superhigh Efficiency and Stable Current Outputs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An MXene/GaN self&#8208;powered ultraviolet photodiode with superhigh peak external quantum efficiency (over 99%) is reported. It is found that two synergistic effects, the robust Schottky&#8208;junction&#8208;induced built&#8208;in electric field and the photoexcited hot carriers, contribute to the high&#8208;performance photodiode. The MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction can be easily fabricated into ultraviolet photodiode arrays with uniform and stable photocurrent outputs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, high&#8208;performance Ti3C2Tx MXene/GaN van der Waals heterojunction (vdWH)&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) photodiode is reported. Such integration creates a Schottky junction depth that is larger than the UV absorption depth to sufficiently separate the photoinduced electron/hole pairs, boosting the peak internal quantum efficiency over the unity and the external quantum efficiency over 99% under weak UV light without bias. The proposed Ti3C2Tx/GaN vdWH UV photodiode demonstrates pronounced photoelectric performances working in self&#8208;powered mode, including a large responsivity (284 mA W&#8722;1), a high specific detectivity (7.06 &#215; 1013 Jones), and fast response speed (rise/decay time of 7.55 &#181;s/1.67 ms). Furthermore, the remarkable photovoltaic behavior leads to an impressive power conversion efficiency of 7.33% under 355 nm UV light illumination. Additionally, this work presents an easy&#8208;processing spray&#8208;deposition route for the fabrication of large&#8208;area UV photodiode arrays that exhibit highly uniform cell&#8208;to&#8208;cell performance. The MXene/GaN photodiode arrays with high&#8208;efficiency and self&#8208;powered ability show high potential for many applications, such as energy&#8208;saving communication, imaging, and sensing networks.

         <title>HCl&#8208;Based Hydrothermal Etching Strategy toward Fluoride&#8208;Free MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The feasibility of etching various MAX materials in HCl solution influenced by temperature and pressure is simulated. Fluoride&#8208;free Mo2CTx MXenes are obtained with high quality and efficiency via a controllable HCl&#8208;hydrothermal etching method. Mo2CTx exhibits an excellent rate performance in supercapacitors owing to the unique surface terminations that significantly change the energy&#8208;storage mechanism compared with F&#8208;terminated MXenes.








Abstract
Due to their ultrathin layered structure and rich elemental variety, MXenes are emerging as a promising electrode candidate in energy generation and storage. MXenes are generally synthesized via hazardous fluoride&#8208;containing reagents from robust MAX materials, unfortunately resulting in plenty of inert fluoride functional groups on the surface that noticeably decline their performance. Density functional theory calculations are used to show the etching feasibility of hydrochloric acid (HCl) on various MAX phases. Based on this theoretical guidance, fluoride&#8208;free Mo2C MXenes with high efficiency about 98% are experimentally demonstrated. The Mo2C electrodes produced by this process exhibit high electrochemical performance in supercapacitors and sodium&#8208;ion batteries owing to the chosen surface functional groups created via the HCl etch process. This strategy enables the development of fluoride&#8208;free MXenes and opens a new window to explore their potential in energy&#8208;storage applications.

         <title>Mechanically Robust and UV&#8208;Curable Shape&#8208;Memory Polymers for Digital Light Processing Based 4D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable shape&#8208;memory polymer (SMP) system can be stretched by up to 1240% of its original length and is compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based high&#8208;resolution 3D printing technology (up to 2&#160;&#181;m). The high deformability and fatigue resistance (more than 10&#160;000 cycles loading&#8211;unloading) make the SMP an ideal 4D printing material for engineering applications.








Abstract
4D printing is an emerging fabrication technology that enables 3D printed structures to change configuration over &#8220;time&#8221; in response to an environmental stimulus. Compared with other soft active materials used for 4D printing, shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) have higher stiffness, and are compatible with various 3D printing technologies. Among them, ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;curable SMPs are compatible with Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D printing to fabricate SMP&#8208;based structures with complex geometry and high&#8208;resolution. However, UV&#8208;curable SMPs have limitations in terms of mechanical performance, which significantly constrains their application ranges. Here, a mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMP system is reported, which is highly deformable, fatigue resistant, and compatible with DLP&#8208;based 3D printing, to fabricate high&#8208;resolution (up to 2&#160;&#181;m), highly complex 3D structures that exhibit large shape change (up to 1240%) upon heating. More importantly, the developed SMP system exhibits excellent fatigue resistance and can be repeatedly loaded more than 10&#160;000 times. The development of the mechanically robust and UV&#8208;curable SMPs significantly improves the mechanical performance of the SMP&#8208;based 4D printing structures, which allows them to be applied to engineering applications such as aerospace, smart furniture, and soft robots.

         <title>Chemical Synthesis and Integration of&#160;Highly Conductive PdTe2&#160;with Low&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors for p&#8208;Type Transistors with Low Contact Barriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The patterned synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D PdTe2 is demonstrated. The as&#8208;grown PdTe2 exhibits high electrical and thermal conductivities, showing potential as an ideal contact material in nanoelectronics. Based on the nondestructive synthesis of PdTe2 patterns directly on various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors, high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with reduced contact barriers are chemically constructed.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors provide promising ultrathin channels for constructing more&#8208;than&#8208;Moore devices. However, the prominent contact barriers at the semiconductor&#8211;metal electrodes interfaces greatly limit the performance of the obtained devices. Here, a chemical approach is developed for the construction of p&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with low contact barriers by achieving the simultaneous synthesis and integration of 2D PdTe2 with various low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors. The 2D PdTe2 synthesized through a quasi&#8208;liquid process exhibits high electrical conductivity (&#8776;4.3 &#215; 106 S m&#8722;1) and thermal conductivity (&#8776;130 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), superior to other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and even higher than some metals. In addition, PdTe2 electrodes with desired geometry can be synthesized directly on 2D MoTe2 and other semiconductors to form high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type FETs without any further treatment. The chemically derived atomically ordered PdTe2&#8211;MoTe2 interface results in significantly reduced contact barrier (65 vs 240 meV) and thus increases the performance of the obtained devices. This work demonstrates the great potential of 2D PdTe2 as contact materials and also opens up a new avenue for the future device fabrication through the chemical construction and integration of 2D components.

The 2D PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; synthesized through a quasi-liquid process exhibits high electrical conductivity (&#8776;4.3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; S m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and thermal conductivity (&#8776;130 W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), superior to other transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and even higher than some metals. In addition, PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes with desired geometry can be synthesized directly on 2D MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and other semiconductors to form high-performance p-type FETs without any further treatment. The chemically derived atomically ordered PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; interface results in significantly reduced contact barrier (65 vs 240 meV) and thus increases the performance of the obtained devices. This work demonstrates the great potential of 2D PdTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as contact materials and also opens up a new avenue for the future device fabrication through the chemical construction and integration of 2D components.&lt;/p&gt;

The few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide and amorphous native defects in multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) synthesized by chemical vapor deposition can drive out&#8208;of&#8208;plane random telegraph noise current signals that are more stable than those traditionally observed in transition metal oxides. The reason is that these defects are confined and completely surrounded by 2D layered and crystalline h&#8208;BN. This allows fabrication of high&#8208;performance true random number generators for advanced data encryption.








Abstract
Advanced data encryption requires the use of true random number generators (TRNGs) to produce unpredictable sequences of bits. TRNG circuits with high degree of randomness and low power consumption may be fabricated by using the random telegraph noise (RTN) current signals produced by polarized metal/insulator/metal (MIM) devices as entropy source. However, the RTN signals produced by MIM devices made of traditional insulators, i.e., transition metal oxides like HfO2 and Al2O3, are not stable enough due to the formation and lateral expansion of defect clusters, resulting in undesired current fluctuations and the disappearance of the RTN effect. Here, the fabrication of highly stable TRNG circuits with low power consumption, high degree of randomness (even for a long string of 224&#160;&#8722; 1 bits), and high throughput of 1 Mbit s&#8722;1 by using MIM devices made of multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is shown. Their application is also demonstrated to produce one&#8208;time passwords, which is ideal for the internet&#8208;of&#8208;everything. The superior stability of the h&#8208;BN&#8208;based TRNG is related to the presence of few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide defects embedded within the layered and crystalline structure of the h&#8208;BN stack, which produces a confinement effect that avoids their lateral expansion and results in stable operation.

In article number 2008379, Ranhua Xiong, Chaobo Huang, Stefaan C. De Smedt, F&#233;lix Sauvage, and co&#8208;workers introduce a laser&#8208;responsive polymeric film for spatial and selective cell killing. Iron oxide clusters embedded in the polymeric film can absorb laser energy and generate vapor bubbles. Single&#8208;cell killing can be achieved at the surface of the eye by the mechanical forces that arise upon the collapse of the bubbles. These bubble forming films have applications as adjuvants after cancer surgery and are promising for safe resection of superficial tumors.

In article 2100185, Mario Lanza and co&#8208;workers use 2D multilayer hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) to fabricate devices that exhibit stable random telegraph noise current signals, and employ them in true random number generator circuits for advanced data encryption. The currents are very stable because they are confined across the few&#8208;atoms&#8208;wide defects embedded within the crystalline and highly stable h&#8208;BN structure, which avoids their lateral propagation.

         <title>Harnessing Innate Immunity Using Biomaterials for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterial&#8208;based cancer immunotherapy has recently drawn significant attention due to the enhanced therapeutic efficacy without adverse effects. A comprehensive overview of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomaterials reinforcing innate immunity in diverse manners is provided. The future perspective of harnessing biomaterials for enhanced cancer immunotherapy is also discussed.








Abstract
The discovery of immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field of immuno&#8208;oncology and established the foundation for developing various new therapies that can surpass conventional cancer treatments. Most recent immunotherapeutic strategies have focused on adaptive immune responses by targeting T cell&#8208;activating pathways, genetic engineering of T cells with chimeric antigen receptors, or bispecific antibodies. Despite the unprecedented clinical success, these T cell&#8208;based treatments have only benefited a small proportion of patients. Thus, the need for the next generation of cancer immunotherapy is driven by identifying novel therapeutic molecules or new immunoengineered cells. To maximize the therapeutic potency via innate immunogenicity, the convergence of innate immunity&#8208;based therapy and biomaterials is required to yield an efficient index in clinical trials. This review highlights how biomaterials can efficiently reprogram and recruit innate immune cells in tumors and ultimately initiate activation of T cell immunity against advanced cancers. Moreover, the design and specific biomaterials that improve innate immune cells&#8217; targeting ability to selectively activate immunogenicity with minimal adverse effects are discussed.

         <title>2D III&#8208;Nitride Materials: Properties, Growth, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The graphene&#8208;like 2D III&#8208;nitride semiconductor materials have unique physical properties such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism, etc. Those advantages prove them to be useful in optoelectronic, electronic, and spin&#8208;based devices and so on. The pro perties, growth methods, and applications of graphene&#8208;like 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are introduced and reviewed.








Abstract
2D III&#8208;nitride materials have been receiving considerable attention recently due to their excellent physicochemical properties, such as high stability, wide and tunable bandgap, and magnetism. Therefore, 2D III&#8208;nitride materials can be applied in various fields, such as electronic and photoelectric devices, spin&#8208;based devices, and gas detectors. Although the developments of 2D h&#8208;BN materials have been successful, the fabrication of other 2D III&#8208;nitride materials, such as 2D h&#8208;AlN, h&#8208;GaN, and h&#8208;InN, are still far from satisfactory, which limits the practical applications of these materials. In this review, recent advances in the properties, growth methods, and potential applications of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are summarized. The properties of the 2D III&#8208;nitride materials are mainly obtained by first&#8208;principles calculations because of the difficulties in the growth and characterizations of these materials. The discussion on the growth of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials is focused on 2D h&#8208;BN and h&#8208;AlN, as the developments of 2D h&#8208;GaN and h&#8208;InN are yet to be realized. Therefore, applications have been realized mostly based on the 2D h&#8208;BN materials; however, many potential applications are cited for the entire range of 2D III&#8208;nitride materials. Finally, future research directions and prospects in this field are also discussed.

         <title>Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Derived Nanostructures as Multifaceted Electrodes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advancements in designing metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived nanostructures for multifaceted electrodes in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are presented. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, polysulfides immobilization and conversion, and morphology&#8211;property correlations for MSB applications are systematically discussed. The future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures are also summarized, which will provide experimental/theoretical guidance in developing fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;sulfur batteries (MSBs) are considered up&#8208;and&#8208;coming future&#8208;generation energy storage systems because of their prominent theoretical energy density. However, the practical applications of MSBs are still hampered by several critical challenges, i.e., the shuttle effects, sluggish redox kinetics, and low conductivity of sulfur species. Recently, benefiting from the high surface area, regulated networks, molecular/atomic&#8208;level reactive sites, the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs)&#8208;derived nanostructures have emerged as efficient and durable multifaceted electrodes in MSBs. Herein, a timely review is presented on recent advancements in designing MOF&#8208;derived electrodes, including fabricating strategies, composition management, topography control, and electrochemical performance assessment. Particularly, the inherent charge transfer, intrinsic polysulfide immobilization, and catalytic conversion on designing and engineering of MOF nanostructures for efficient MSBs are systematically discussed. In the end, the essence of how MOFs&#8217; nanostructures influence their electrochemical properties in MSBs and conclude the future tendencies regarding the construction of MOF&#8208;derived electrodes in MSBs is exposed. It is believed that this progress review will provide significant experimental/theoretical guidance in designing and understanding the MOF&#8208;derived nanostructures as multifaceted electrodes, thus offering promising orientations for the future development of fast&#8208;kinetic and robust MSBs in broad energy fields.

         <title>A Roadmap to Cardiac Tissue&#8208;Engineered Construct Preservation: Insights from Cells, Tissues, and Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Successful preservation methods for cardiac&#8208;tissue&#8208;engineered constructs will allow transportation and storage for off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability, both critical for translating this technology to clinical use, opening new avenues for the treatment/prevention of heart failure. A theoretical foundation for cardiac&#8208;tissue&#8208;engineered construct preservation is presented, with the aim to provide a roadmap to design safe and robust storage protocols.








Abstract
Worldwide, over 26 million patients suffer from heart failure (HF). One strategy aspiring to prevent or even to reverse HF is based on the transplantation of cardiac tissue&#8208;engineered (cTE) constructs. These patient&#8208;specific constructs aim to closely resemble the native myocardium and, upon implantation on the diseased tissue, support and restore cardiac function, thereby preventing the development of HF. However, cTE constructs off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf availability in the clinical arena critically depends on the development of efficient preservation methodologies. Short&#8208; and long&#8208;term preservation of cTE constructs would enable transportation and direct availability. Herein, currently available methods, from normothermic&#8208; to hypothermic&#8208; to cryopreservation, for the preservation of cardiomyocytes, whole&#8208;heart, and regenerative materials are reviewed. A theoretical foundation and recommendations for future research on developing cTE construct specific preservation methods are provided. Current research suggests that vitrification can be a promising procedure to ensure long&#8208;term cryopreservation of cTE constructs, despite the need of high doses of cytotoxic cryoprotective agents. Instead, short&#8208;term cTE construct preservation can be achieved at normothermic or hypothermic temperatures by administration of protective additives. With further tuning of these promising methods, it is anticipated that cTE construct therapy can be brought one step closer to the patient.

Abstract
Piezoelectric materials, with their unique ability for mechanical&#8208;electrical energy conversion, have been widely applied in important fields such as sensing, energy harvesting, wastewater treatment, and catalysis. In recent years, advances in material synthesis and engineering have provided new opportunities for the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials with excellent biocompatibility and piezoelectric performance. Bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials have attracted interdisciplinary research interest due to recent insights on the impact of piezoelectricity on biological systems and their versatile biomedical applications. This review therefore introduces the development of bio&#8208;piezoelectric platforms from a broad perspective and highlights their design and engineering strategies. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art biomedical applications in both biosensing and disease treatment will be systematically outlined. The relationships between the properties, structure, and biomedical performance of the bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials are examined to provide a deep understanding of the working mechanisms in a physiological environment. Finally, the development trends and challenges are discussed, with the aim to provide new insights for the design and construction of future bio&#8208;piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Emerging of Heterostructure Materials in Energy Storage: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 27, July 8, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Constructing heterostructures is an effective way to enhance the electrochemical performance of active materials due to the unique heterointerface structure and some unrevealed synergistic effects. An overview of the recent advancements in heterostructured materials in terms of enhanced mechanism, synthesis techniques, and electrochemical performance is provided. Future development trends for design of heterostructured electrodes are analyzed.








Abstract
With the ever&#8208;increasing adaption of large&#8208;scale energy storage systems and electric devices, the energy storage capability of batteries and supercapacitors has faced increased demand and challenges. The electrodes of these devices have experienced radical change with the introduction of nano&#8208;scale materials. As new generation materials, heterostructure materials have attracted increasing attention due to their unique interfaces, robust architectures, and synergistic effects, and thus, the ability to enhance the energy/power outputs as well as the lifespan of batteries. In this review, the recent progress in heterostructure from energy storage fields is summarized. Specifically, the fundamental natures of heterostructures, including charge redistribution, built&#8208;in electric field, and associated energy storage mechanisms, are summarized and discussed in detail. Furthermore, various synthesis routes for heterostructures in energy storage fields are roundly reviewed, and their advantages and drawbacks are analyzed. The superiorities and current achievements of heterostructure materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (Li&#8208;S batteries), supercapacitors, and other energy storage devices are discussed. Finally, the authors conclude with the current challenges and perspectives of the heterostructure materials for the fields of energy storage.

         <title>Current&#8208;Controlled Topological Magnetic Transformations in a Nanostructured Kagome Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Current&#8208;controlled topological skyrmion&#8211;bubble and skyrmion&#8211;stripe transformations are achieved in a reversible and reproducible way by tuning the nanosecond pulsed current amplitude on the order of &#8776;1010 A m&#8722;2, which enables future reliable and energy&#8208;efficient manipulation of electromagnetic properties in topological spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topological magnetic charge Q is a fundamental parameter that describes the magnetic domains and determines their intriguing electromagnetic properties. The ability to switch Q in a controlled way by electrical methods allows for flexible manipulation of electromagnetic behavior in future spintronic devices. Here, the room&#8208;temperature current&#8208;controlled topological magnetic transformations between Q&#160;=&#160;&#8722;1 skyrmions and Q&#160;= 0 stripes or type&#8208;II bubbles in a kagome crystal Fe3Sn2 are reported. It is shown that reproducible and reversible skyrmion&#8211;bubble and skyrmion&#8211;stripe transformations can be achieved by tuning the density of nanosecond pulsed current of the order of &#8776;1010 A m&#8722;2. Further numerical simulations suggest that spin&#8208;transfer torque combined with Joule thermal heating effects determine the current&#8208;induced topological magnetic transformations.

         <title>&#8220;Manipulation&#8221; of Crystal Structure by Methylthiolation Enabling Ultrahigh Mobility in a Pyrene&#8208;Based Molecular Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylthiolation is a simple but powerful way to control the crystal structures and thus the transport properties of molecular semiconductors; the sandwich herringbone structure of pyrene is altered into a new type of brickwork structure in 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene), which turns out to be an excellent molecular semiconductor showing the ultrahigh mobility and band&#8208;like transport in the single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Control and prediction of crystal structures of molecular semiconductors are considered challenging, yet they are crucial for rational design of superior molecular semiconductors. It is here reported that through methylthiolation, one can rationally control the crystal structure of pyrene derivatives as molecular semiconductors; 1,6&#8208;bis(methylthio)pyrene keeps a similar sandwich herringbone structure to that of parent pyrene, whereas 1,3,6,8&#8208;tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT&#8208;pyrene) takes a new type of brickwork structure. Such changes in these crystal structures are explained by the alteration of intermolecular interactions that are efficiently controlled by methylthiolation. Single crystals of MT&#8208;pyrene are evaluated as the active semiconducting material in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;FETs), which show extremely high mobility (32 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 on average) operating at the drain and gate voltages of &#8722;5&#160;V. Moreover, the band&#8208;like transport and very low trap density are experimentally confirmed for the MT&#8208;pyrene SC&#8208;FETs, testifying that the MT&#8208;pyrene is among the best molecular semiconductors for the SC&#8208;FET devices.

&lt;p&gt;Methylthiolation is a simple but powerful way to control the crystal structures and thus the transport properties of molecular semiconductors; the sandwich herringbone structure of pyrene is altered into a new type of brickwork structure in 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT-pyrene), which turns out to be an excellent molecular semiconductor showing the ultrahigh mobility and band-like transport in the single-crystal field-effect transistors.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control and prediction of crystal structures of molecular semiconductors are considered challenging, yet they are crucial for rational design of superior molecular semiconductors. It is here reported that through methylthiolation, one can rationally control the crystal structure of pyrene derivatives as molecular semiconductors; 1,6-bis(methylthio)pyrene keeps a similar sandwich herringbone structure to that of parent pyrene, whereas 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(methylthio)pyrene (MT-pyrene) takes a new type of brickwork structure. Such changes in these crystal structures are explained by the alteration of intermolecular interactions that are efficiently controlled by methylthiolation. Single crystals of MT-pyrene are evaluated as the active semiconducting material in single-crystal field-effect transistors (SC-FETs), which show extremely high mobility (32 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; on average) operating at the drain and gate voltages of &lt;b&gt;&#8722;&lt;/b&gt;5&#160;V. Moreover, the band-like transport and very low trap density are experimentally confirmed for the MT-pyrene SC-FETs, testifying that the MT-pyrene is among the best molecular semiconductors for the SC-FET devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Based Free&#8208;Standing Proton&#8208;Conducting Transparent Elastomer for Large&#8208;Scale Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Serum albumin is used as an affordable raw material for the creation of a transparent polymer using a green chemistry one&#8208;pot process, having attractive protonic&#8208;conductivity (5 mS cm&#8722;1) and elastic properties. The resulting polymer is cheap with a price&#8208;tag of $0.01 per cm2, and it is used as a solid&#8208;state flexible platform for physio&#8208;electric sensing.








Abstract
A most important endeavor in modern materials&#8217; research is the current shift toward green environmental and sustainable materials. Natural resources are one of the attractive building blocks for making environmentally friendly materials. In most cases, however, the performance of nature&#8208;derived materials is inferior to the performance of carefully designed synthetic materials. This is especially true for conductive polymers, which is the topic here. Inspired by the natural role of proteins in mediating protons, their utilization in the creation of a free&#8208;standing transparent polymer with a highly elastic nature and proton conductivity comparable to that of synthetic polymers, is demonstrated. Importantly, the polymerization process relies on natural protein crosslinkers and is spontaneous and energy&#8208;efficient. The protein used, bovine serum albumin, is one of the most affordable proteins, resulting in the ability to create large&#8208;scale materials at a low cost. Due to the inherent biodegradability and biocompatibility of the elastomer, it is promising for biomedical applications. Here, its immediate utilization as a solid&#8208;state interface for sensing of electrophysiological signals, is shown.

         <title>Unveiling the Stabilities of Nickel&#8208;Based Layered Oxide Cathodes at an Identical Degree of Delithiation in Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Distinctive insights into the stabilities of the LiNi1&#8722;x&#8211;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathode family on the basis of the degrees of delithiation are reported. It is revealed that NMC cathodes with higher Ni content may suggest better overall stabilities under an identical degree of delithiation, which contrasts with the common belief that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents have inherently reduced stabilities.








Abstract
Bulk, surface, and interfacial instabilities that impact the cycle and thermal performances are the major challenges with high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LiNi1&#8722;x&#8211;yMnxCoyO2 (NMC) cathodes with high nickel contents. It is generally believed that the instabilities and performance losses become exponentially aggravated as the nickel content increases. Disparate from this prevailing belief, it is herein demonstrated that NMC cathodes with higher Ni contents may imply better overall stability than &#8220;lower&#8208;Ni&#8221; cathodes under an identical degree of delithiation (charging) conditions. With two representative cathodes, LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiNiO2, a systematic investigation into their stabilities with control of the degree of delithiation is presented. Electrochemical tests indicate that LiNiO2 displays better cyclability than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 at the same delithiation state. Comprehensive structural and interphase investigations unveil that the inferior cyclability of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 predominantly results from aggravated parasitic reactions, and the interphase stability may be more critical than lattice stability in dictating cyclability. Also, LiNiO2 delivers similar or better thermal behavior than LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The findings demonstrate a strong correlation of the stability of NMC cathodes to the degree of delithiation state rather than the Ni content itself, highlighting the importance of reassessing the true implications of Ni content and structural and interphasial tuning on the stabilities of NMC cathodes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Far&#8208;Red/NIR&#8208;Absorbing Neutral Ir(III) Complex Micelles for Potent Photodynamic/Photothermal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing neutral Ir(III) complex (BODIPY&#8208;Ir) bearing the distyryl boron dipyrromethene motif and its encapsulated micelles (Micelle&#8208;Ir) for potent photodynamic/photothermal therapy (PDT/PTT) against aggressive tumors are reported. Micelle&#8208;Ir demonstrates a remarkable therapeutic efficacy against primary breast and metastatic lung tumors through bifunctional PDT/PTT damage in a cooperative manner.








Abstract
A critical issue in photodynamic therapy (PDT) is inadequate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in tumors, causing inevitable survival of tumor cells that usually results in tumor recurrence and metastasis. Existing photosensitizers frequently suffer from relatively low light&#8208;to&#8208;ROS conversion efficiency with far&#8208;red/near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light excitation due to low&#8208;lying excited states that lead to rapid non&#8208;radiative decays. Here, a neutral Ir(III) complex bearing distyryl boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY&#8208;Ir) is reported to efficiently produce both ROS and hyperthermia upon far&#8208;red light activation for potentiating in vivo tumor suppression through micellization of BODIPY&#8208;Ir to form &#8220;Micelle&#8208;Ir&#8221;. BODIPY&#8208;Ir absorbs strongly at 550&#8211;750&#160;nm with a band maximum at 685&#160;nm, and possesses a long&#8208;lived triplet excited state with sufficient non&#8208;radiative decays. Upon micellization, BODIPY&#8208;Ir forms J&#8208;type aggregates within Micelle&#8208;Ir, which boosts both singlet oxygen generation and the photothermal effect through the high molar extinction coefficient and amplification of light&#8208;to&#8208;ROS/heat conversion, causing severe cell apoptosis. Bifunctional Micelle&#8208;Ir that accumulates in tumors completely destroys orthotopic 4T1 breast tumors via synergistic PDT/photothermal therapy (PTT) damage under light irradiation, and enables remarkable suppression of metastatic nodules in the lungs, together without significant dark cytotoxicity. The present study offers an emerging approach to develop far&#8208;red/NIR photosensitizers toward potent cancer therapy.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya Interaction and Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Switchable Topological Spin Texture in SrRuO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By constructing a chemical junction between oxygen&#8208;deficient and stoichiometric SrRuO3, a particularly strong interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction is induced, which stabilizes skyrmionic magnetic bubbles at the nanoscale and thus leads to a topological Hall effect. Moreover, such topological spin textures can be reversibly controlled through an electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable migration of oxygen vacancies. In addition, the topological Hall signal can be deterministically switched ON and OFF.








Abstract
In situ electrical control of the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) is one of the central but challenging goals toward skyrmion&#8208;based device applications. An atomic design of defective interfaces in spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled transition&#8208;metal oxides can be an appealing strategy to achieve this goal. In this work, by utilizing the distinct formation energies and diffusion barriers of oxygen vacancies at SrRuO3/SrTiO3(001), a sharp interface is constructed between oxygen&#8208;deficient and stoichiometric SrRuO3. This interfacial inversion&#8208;symmetry breaking leads to a sizable DMI, which can induce skyrmionic magnetic bubbles and the topological Hall effect in a more than 10 unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick SrRuO3. This topological spin texture can be reversibly manipulated through the migration of oxygen vacancies under electric gating. In particular, the topological Hall signal can be deterministically switched ON and OFF. This result implies that the defect&#8208;engineered topological spin textures may offer an alternate perspective for future skyrmion&#8208;based memristor and synaptic devices.

In this work, by utilizing the distinct formation energies and diffusion barriers of oxygen vacancies at SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(001), a sharp interface is constructed between oxygen-deficient and stoichiometric SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This interfacial inversion-symmetry breaking leads to a sizable DMI, which can induce skyrmionic magnetic bubbles and the topological Hall effect in a more than 10 unit-cell-thick SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This topological spin texture can be reversibly manipulated through the migration of oxygen vacancies under electric gating. In particular, the topological Hall signal can be deterministically switched ON and OFF. This result implies that the defect-engineered topological spin textures may offer an alternate perspective for future skyrmion-based memristor and synaptic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Intrinsic Electron Localization of Metastable MoS2 Boosts Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable MoS2 with intrinsic electron localization is demonstrated as highly efficient electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction. The NH3 yield rate and the Faradaic efficiency of metastable 1T&#8243;&#8242; MoS2 are about 9 and 12 times than those of 2H MoS2, correspondingly. This work develops a new class of non&#8208;noble materials catalysts for nitrogen fixation.








Abstract
The advancement of efficient electrocatalysts toward the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is critical in sustainable ammonia synthesis under ambient pressure and temperature. Manipulating the electronic configuration of electrocatalysts is particularly vital to form metal&#8211;nitrogen (M&#63743;N) bonds during the NRR through regulating the active electronic states of sites. Here, in sharp contrast to stable 2H MoS2 without metal chains, Mo&#63743;Mo bonding in metastable polymorphs of MoS2 bulk (zigzag chain in the 1T&#8242; phase and diamond chain in the 1T&#8243;&#8242; phase) is discovered to significantly increase intrinsic electron localization around the metal chains. This can enhance the charge transfer from the adsorbed nitrogen molecule to the metal chains, allowing for boosted NRR kinetics. The electrochemical experiments show that the NH3 yield rate and the faradaic efficiency of the metastable 1T&#8243;&#8242; MoS2 rich with abundant Mo&#8211;Mo bonds are about 9 and 12 times above average than those of 2H MoS2, correspondingly. Theoretical simulations reveal the high local electron density surrounding the Mo&#63743;Mo chains and sites can promote &#960; back&#8208;donation, which is beneficial for increasing nitrogen adsorption, strengthening the M&#63743;N bonds, and reducing the cleavage barrier of the triple N&#63741;N bond.

         <title>Multifunctional Conjugated Ligand Engineering for Stable and Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
One of the challenges in perovskite solar cells is passivating the perovskite surface without hindering charge extraction. Herein, a conjugated ligand is introduced to the interface between perovskite and hole&#8208;transporting layer, and shows efficient hole extraction with improved energy level alignment and suppressed phase segregation. Therefore, devices with high efficiency and stability are achieved.








Abstract
Surface passivation is an effective way to boost the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, a key challenge faced by most of the passivation strategies is reducing the interface charge recombination without imposing energy barriers to charge extraction. Here, a novel multifunctional semiconducting organic ammonium cationic interface modifier inserted between the light&#8208;harvesting perovskite film and the hole&#8208;transporting layer is reported. It is shown that the conjugated cations can directly extract holes from perovskite efficiently, and simultaneously reduce interface non&#8208;radiative recombination. Together with improved energy level alignment and the stabilized interface in the device, a triple&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide medium&#8208;bandgap PSC with an excellent power conversion efficiency of 22.06% (improved from 19.94%) and suppressed ion migration and halide phase segregation, which lead to a long&#8208;term operational stability, is demonstrated. This strategy provides a new practical method of interface engineering in PSCs toward improved efficiency and stability.

         <title>Ultrathin and Ultrasensitive Direct X&#8208;ray Detector Based on Heterojunction Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin and ultrasensitive direct X&#8208;ray detector based on a heterojunction phototransistor is developed by taking advantage of high&#8208;gain and gating&#8208;modulation mechanisms. This unique device concept allows for a significant reduction in X&#8208;ray photoconductor thickness while maintaining high sensitivity and low detection limit, which opens up new opportunities for developing high&#8208;resolution, flexible, and low&#8208;cost X&#8208;ray direct detectors.








Abstract
Most contemporary X&#8208;ray detectors adopt device structures with non/low&#8208;gain energy conversion, such that a fairly thick X&#8208;ray photoconductor or scintillator is required to generate sufficient X&#8208;ray&#8208;induced charges, and thus numerous merits for thin devices, such as mechanical flexibility and high spatial resolution, have to be compromised. This dilemma is overcome by adopting a new high&#8208;gain device concept of a heterojunction X&#8208;ray phototransistor. In contrast to conventional detectors, X&#8208;ray phototransistors allow both electrical gating and photodoping for effective carrier&#8208;density modulation, leading to high photoconductive gain and low noise. As a result, ultrahigh sensitivities of over 105&#160;&#956;C Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 with low detection limit are achieved by just using an &#8776;50 nm thin photoconductor. The employment of ultrathin photoconductors also endows the detectors with superior flexibility and high imaging resolution. This concept offers great promise in realizing well&#8208;balanced detection performance, mechanical flexibility, integration, and cost for next&#8208;generation X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Tunable Structural Color Images by UV&#8208;Patterned Conducting Polymer Nanofilms on Metal Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A UV light patterning method turns monochromic conducting polymers into multicolor images, using the UV dose to control structural coloration via both the film thickness and polymer permittivity. Electrochemical modulation of the conducting polymer redox states further enables dynamic tuning of the structurally colored images.








Abstract
Precise manipulation of light&#8211;matter interactions has enabled a wide variety of approaches to create bright and vivid structural colors. Techniques utilizing photonic crystals, Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavities, plasmonics, or high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index dielectric metasurfaces have been studied for applications ranging from optical coatings to reflective displays. However, complicated fabrication procedures for sub&#8208;wavelength nanostructures, limited active areas, and inherent absence of tunability of these approaches impede their further development toward flexible, large&#8208;scale, and switchable devices compatible with facile and cost&#8208;effective production. Here, a novel method is presented to generate structural color images based on monochromic conducting polymer films prepared on metallic surfaces via vapor phase polymerization and ultraviolet (UV) light patterning. Varying the UV dose enables synergistic control of both nanoscale film thickness and polymer permittivity, which generates controllable structural colors from violet to red. Together with grayscale photomasks this enables facile fabrication of high&#8208;resolution structural color images. Dynamic tuning of colored surfaces and images via electrochemical modulation of the polymer redox state is further demonstrated. The simple structure, facile fabrication, wide color gamut, and dynamic color tuning make this concept competitive for applications like multifunctional displays.

         <title>Geometric Modulation of Local CO Flux in Ag@Cu2O Nanoreactors for Steering the CO2RR Pathway toward High&#8208;Efficacy Methane Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique category of CO2RR catalysts with a yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu2O shell that resembles a tandem nanoreactor, is fabricated. The shell envelop size can be finely tuned to regulate the CO flux arriving at the oxide&#8208;derived Cu shell, which further modulates *CO coverage and *H adsorption, consequently steering the electrocatalytic CO2RR pathway.








Abstract
The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) to CH4 stands as one of the promising paths for resourceful CO2 utilization in meeting the imminent &#8220;carbon&#8208;neutral&#8221; goal of the near future.

&lt;p&gt;A unique category of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalysts with a yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O shell that resembles a tandem nanoreactor, is fabricated. The shell envelop size can be finely tuned to regulate the CO flux arriving at the oxide-derived Cu shell, which further modulates *CO coverage and *H adsorption, consequently steering the electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR pathway.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR) to CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; stands as one of the promising paths for resourceful CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization in meeting the imminent &#8220;carbon-neutral&#8221; goal of the near future. Yet, limited success has been witnessed in the development of high-efficiency catalysts imparting satisfactory methane selectivity at a commercially viable current density. Herein, a unique category of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR catalysts is fabricated with the yolk&#8211;shell nanocell structure, comprising an Ag core and a Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O shell that resembles the tandem nanoreactor.

         <title>An Innovative Solvent&#8208;Responsive Coiling&#8211;Expanding Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellulose&#8208;based vascular stent, which can realize self&#8208;expansion for supporting vessels by blood, is constructed. The physical, chemical, and biological properties of the as&#8208;prepared stent are systemically investigated. In addition, theoretical modeling for the as&#8208;prepared stent is conducted. The results reveal that the achieved vascular stent can make outstanding contributions in the tissue engineering.








Abstract
Coronary artery disease is the &#8220;first killer&#8221; in the world, while the classical treatment for this disease is to implant stent. An ideal vascular stent should be nontoxic with self&#8208;expanding characteristics, quick expanding speed, and appropriate mechanical supporting property. However, no existing vascular stent covers all properties. Herein, a two&#8208;way shape&#8208;memory cellulose vascular stent, which can realize shape adjustments by mild solutions such as water and alcohol, is constructed. The shape&#8208;memory characteristics, mechanical properties, cell toxicity, and biocompatibility, are systemically investigated by ex vivo experiment as well as molecule simulation and theoretical modeling, revealing that the achieved bilayer two&#8208;way shape&#8208;memory films (BSMFs) can be used as an artificial vascular stent. In particular, this vascular stent made from BSMFs shows superb biocompatibility according to live/dead cell viability assays. Ex vivo experiments reveal that the novel vascular stent can support arteria coronaria sinistra, or the left main coronary artery, at the opening state while the cross&#8208;section of the vessel becomes two times larger than that of the initial state after implantation. Thus, it is believed that effective and scalable BSMFs can make meritorious fundamental contributions to biomaterials science and practical applications such as vascular stents.

         <title>Grain&#8208;Boundary Engineering of Monolayer MoS2 for Energy&#8208;Efficient Lateral Synaptic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With lithography&#8208;free, direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing&#8208;controlled MoS2/MoS2&#8722;xO&#948; grain boundaries, synaptic devices exhibit short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously, as well as low energy consumption that is over 40 times lower than that of conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor devices.








Abstract
Synaptic devices based on 2D&#8208;layered materials have emerged as high&#8208;efficiency electronic synapses and neurons for neuromorphic computing. Lateral 2D synaptic devices have the advantages of multiple functionalities by responding to diverse stimuli, but they consume large amounts of energy, far more than the human brain. Moreover, current lateral devices employ several mechanisms based on conductive filaments and grain boundaries (GBs), but their formation is random and difficult to control, also hindering their practical applications. Here, four&#8208;terminal, lateral synaptic devices with artificially engineered GBs are reported, which are made from monolayer MoS2. With lithography&#8208;free, direct&#8208;laser&#8208;writing&#8208;controlled MoS2/MoS2&#8722;xO&#948; GBs, such synaptic devices exhibit short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term plasticity characteristics that are responsive to electric and light stimulation simultaneously. This enables detailed simulations of biological learning and cognitive processes as well as image perception and processing. In particular, the device exhibits low energy consumption, similar to that of the human brain and much lower than those of other lateral 2D synaptic devices. This work provides an effective way to fabricate lateral synaptic devices for practical application development and sheds light on controllable electrical state switching for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Formulation of a Composite Nasal Spray Enabling Enhanced Surface Coverage and Prophylaxis of SARS&#8208;COV&#8208;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
There&#160;is a high risk of transmission of airborne pathogens through the nasal epithelium. This study reports a novel nasal spray, which is designed to maximize surface coverage and prevent infection through physical entrapment and inhibition of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2).








Abstract
Airborne pathogens pose high risks in terms of both contraction and transmission within the respiratory pathways, particularly the nasal region. However, there is little in the way of adequate intervention that can protect an individual or prevent further spread. This study reports on a nasal formulation with the capacity to combat such challenges, focusing on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). Formulation of a polysaccharide&#8208;based spray, known for its mucoadhesive properties, is undertaken and it is characterized for its mechanical, spray distribution, and antiviral properties. The ability to engineer key mechanical characteristics such as dynamic yield stresses and high coverage is shown, through systematic understanding of the composite mixture containing both gellan and &#955;&#8208;carrageenan. Furthermore, the spray systems demonstrate highly potent capacities to prevent SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 infection in Vero cells, resulting in complete inhibition when either treating, the cells, or the virus, prior to challenging for infection. From this data, a mechanism for both prophylaxis and prevention is proposed; where entrapment within a polymeric coating sterically blocks virus uptake into the cells, inactivating the virus, and allowing clearance within the viscous medium. As such, a fully preventative spray is formulated, targeted at protecting the lining of the upper respiratory pathways against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2.

         <title>Strain Effects on Rashba Spin&#8208;Orbit Coupling of 2D Hole Gases in GeSn/Ge Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first 2D hole gas (2DHG) in GeSn/Ge heterostructures and the strongest Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) among group&#8208;IV materials are demonstrated. The SOC strength is controlled by modulating the 2DHG density via top gating, which enables effective spin manipulation for a spin logic device and fast quantum computing for spin qubits via SOC effects.








Abstract
A demonstration of 2D hole gases in GeSn/Ge heterostructures with a mobility as high as 20 000&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is given. Both the Shubnikov&#8211;de Haas oscillations and integer quantum Hall effect are observed, indicating high sample quality. The Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) is investigated via magneto&#8208;transport. Further, a transition from weak localization to weak anti&#8208;localization is observed, which shows the tunability of the SOC strength by gating. The magneto&#8208;transport data are fitted to the Hikami&#8211;Larkin&#8211;Nagaoka formula. The phase&#8208;coherence and spin&#8208;relaxation times, as well as spin&#8208;splitting energy and Rashba coefficient of the k&#8208;cubic term, are extracted. The analysis reveals that the effects of strain and confinement potential at a high fraction of Sn suppress the Rashba SOC caused by the GeSn/Ge&#160;heterostructures.

         <title>Dense All&#8208;Electrochem&#8208;Active Electrodes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of cathodes with superior ionic/electronic conductivities is demonstrated for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. No carbon and electrolyte additives are needed in such an &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) cathode so the space and mass of the electrode are fully utilized and high mass/volume energy density are obtained.








Abstract
The energy density presents the core competitiveness of lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries. In conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries, the utilization of the gravimetric/volumetric energy density at the electrode level is unsatisfactory (&lt;84 wt% and &lt;62 vol%,&#160;respectively)&#160;due to the existence of non&#8208;electrochemical active parts among the 3D porous electrodes, including electrolytes, binders, and carbon additives. These are regarded as indispensable and irreducible components of the electronic and ionic transport network. Here, a dense &#8220;all&#8208;electrochem&#8208;active&#8221; (AEA) electrode for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li batteries is proposed, which is entirely constructed from a family of superior mixed electronic&#8211;ionic&#8208;conducting cathodes, to minimize the energy density gap between the accessible and theoretical energy density at the electrode level. Furthermore, with the ionic&#8211;electronic&#8208;conductive network self&#8208;supported from the AEA cathode, the dense hybrid sulfur (S)&#8208;based AEA electrode exhibits a high compacted filling rate of 91.8%, which indicates a high energy density of 777 W h kg&#8722;1 and 1945 W h L&#8722;1 at the electrode level based on the total cathodes and anodes when at 70 &#176;C.

         <title>Adipocyte&#8208;Derived Anticancer Lipid Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is engineered to be a controllable, effective, and biocompatible drug delivery system for cancer therapy. It is demonstrated that the lipid droplet can augment the therapeutic performance of an encapsulated drug via several pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, providing a promising material with clinical translation potential.








Abstract
Engineering of efficient and safe materials remains a challenge for cancer therapy. Here, the lipid droplet, an organelle in adipocytes, is demonstrated to be a controllable and biocompatible vehicle to deliver anticancer drugs. It is validated that isolated lipid droplets maintain their key physiological functions to interact with other organelles and augment the therapeutic effect of cancer photodynamic therapy by encapsulation with a lipid&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer (Pyrolipid) through a variety of pathways, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS); lipid peroxidation; and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. As such, the IC50 value of Pyrolipid is reduced by 6.0&#8208;fold when loaded into the lipid droplet. Of note, in vivo results demonstrate that engineered lipid droplets induce significant inhibition of tumor growth with minimal side effects.

         <title>Biomimetic Dendrimer&#8211;Peptide Conjugates for Early Multi&#8208;Target Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Inflammatory Microenvironment Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;target nanoconjugate is developed to target the Alzheimer's disease microenvironment in the early stage. Synergistic therapeutic effects are achieved by scavenging reactive oxygen species, restoring cellular antioxidant capacity, polarizing microglia phenotype, inhibiting formation of &#946;&#8208;amyloid plaques, and recovering immunologic function based on the functional polymers and nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 activating peptide. Cognitive functions are enhanced in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model transgenic mice after treatment.








Abstract
Current therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatments mainly focus on &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) targeting. However, such therapeutic strategies have limited clinical outcomes due to the chronic and irreversible impairment of the nervous system in the late stage of AD. Recently, inflammatory responses, manifested in oxidative stress and glial cell activation, have been reported as hallmarks in the early stages of AD. Based on the crosstalk between inflammatory response and brain cells, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive dendrimer&#8211;peptide conjugate (APBP) is devised to target the AD microenvironment and inhibit inflammatory responses at an early stage. With the modification of the targeting peptide, this nanoconjugate can efficiently deliver peptides to the infected regions and restore the antioxidant ability of neurons by activating the nuclear factor (erythroid&#8208;derived 2)&#8208;like 2 signaling pathway. Moreover, this multi&#8208;target strategy exhibits a synergistic function of ROS scavenging, promoting A&#946; phagocytosis, and normalizing the glial cell phenotype. As a result, the nanoconjugate can reduce ROS level, decrease A&#946; burden, alleviate glial cell activation, and eventually enhance cognitive functions in APPswe/PSEN1dE9 model mice. These results indicate that APBP can be a promising candidate for the multi&#8208;target treatment of AD.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Deformable and Tissue&#8208;Adhesive Liquid Metal Antennas with High Wireless Powering Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fabrication of unprecedentedly deformable liquid metal antennas by direct ink writing of silicone microchannels on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated. Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated thin&#8208;film antenna to ex vivo animal tissues and reliable wireless operations under mechanical deformations are also demonstrated.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable antennas are important for wireless communication using wearable and implantable devices to address mechanical mismatch at the tissue&#8211;device interface. Emerging technologies of liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;based stretchable electronics are promising approaches to improve the flexibility and stretchability of conventional metal&#8208;based antennas. However, existing methods to encapsulate liquid metals require monolithically thick (at least 100&#160;&#181;m) substrates, and the resulting devices are limited in deformability and tissue&#8208;adhesiveness. To overcome this limitation, fabrication of microchannels by direct ink writing on a 7 &#181;m&#8208;thick elastomeric substrate is demonstrated, to obtain liquid metal microfluidic antennas with unprecedented deformability. The fabricated wireless light&#8208;emitting device is powered by a standard near&#8208;field&#8208;communication system (13.56&#160;MHz, 1 W) and retained a consistent operation under deformations including stretching (&gt;200% uniaxial strain), twisting (180&#176; twist), and bending (3.0 mm radius of curvature) while maintaining a high quality factor (q&#160;&gt; 20). Suture&#8208;free conformal adhesion of the polydopamine&#8208;coated device to ex vivo animal tissues under mechanical deformations is also demonstrated. This technology offers a new capability for the design and fabrication of wireless biomedical devices requiring conformable tissue&#8208;device integration toward minimally invasive, imperceptible medical treatments.

A deformable albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsion with self&#8208;adaptive deformability, which can squeeze through the cellular gaps of lymphatic vessels for lymph node (LN) delivery (intercellular pathway), is engineered. Concurrently, they tend to also be internalized and drained to the LNs by the immunocytes (intracellular pathway). Through the dual LN&#8208;transfer, exploiting the deformability may offer an alternative way for efficient LN delivery and vaccinations.








Abstract
A major challenge in vaccine delivery is to achieve robust lymph&#8208;node (LN) accumulation, which can capitalize on concentrated immunocytes and cytokines in LNs to stimulate the onset and persistence of adaptive immune responses. Previous attempts at developing vaccine delivery systems have focused on the sizes, charges, or surface ligands but not on their deformability. In fact, the LN homing of antigen&#8208;presenting cells depends on deformability to pass through the cellular gaps. Herein, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized emulsions is engineered. Owing to self&#8208;adaptive deformability, the droplets (&#8776;330 nm) can attach to and deform between cells and adjust their sizes to pass through the endothelial gaps (20&#8211;100 nm), favoring direct LN transfer (intercellular pathway). Additionally, owing to relatively large sizes, some emulsions can be retained at the administration sites for potent antigen uptake and activation of APCs as well as LN&#8208;targeted delivery of vaccines (intracellular pathway). Compared with solid particles, the dual LN transfer strategy evidently enhances antigen accumulation and activation of LN drainage, potently stimulates cellular immune responses, and increases the survival rate of tumor&#8208;bearing mice. Thus, the deformability of albumin&#8208;stabilized droplets may offer an efficient strategy for potent LN targeting and enhanced vaccinations.

         <title>Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber.








Abstract
Dendritic network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are proposed. The architecture of the fibrous organic electrochemical transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enables the highly sensitive multiple implementation of synaptic junctions via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, similar to the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. In particular, carboxylic&#8208;acid&#8208;functionalized polythiophene as a semiconductor channel material provides stable gate&#8208;field&#8208;dependent multilevel memory characteristics with long&#8208;term stability and cyclic endurance, unlike the conventional poly(alkylthiophene)&#8208;based neuromorphic electrochemical transistors, which exhibit short retention and unstable endurance. The dissociation of the carboxylic acid of the polythiophene enables reversible doping and dedoping of the polythiophene channel by effectively stabilizing the ions that penetrate the channel during potentiation and depression cycles, leading to the reliable cyclic endurance of the device. The synaptic weight of the neurofiber transistors with a dendritic network maintains the state levels stably and is independently updated with each synapse connected with the presynaptic neuron to a specific state level. Finally, the neurofiber transistor demonstrates successful speech recognition based on iterative spiking neural network learning in the time domain, showing a substantial recognition accuracy of 88.9%.

         <title>Supra&#8208;Binary Polarization in a Ferroelectric Nanowire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quaternary switching hysteresis in a graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is demonstrated by imposing an anisotropic bias field to a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) gate with a diameter of &#8776;250&#160;nm. As switching characteristics of the associated GNR field&#8208;effect transistor, the FNW hosts four polar states: vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out, which are complemented by Landau&#8211;Ginzburg theory modeling.








Abstract
The prediction and observation of supra&#8208;binary polarization in a ferroelectric nanowire (FNW) covered with a semicylindrical gate that provides an anisotropic electric field in the FNW are reported. There are gate&#8208;voltage&#8208;driven transitions between four polarization states in the FNW's cross&#8208;section, dubbed vertical&#8208;up, vertical&#8208;down, radial&#8208;in, and radial&#8208;out. They are determined by the interplay between the spatial depolarization energy and the free energy induced by an anisotropic external electric field, in clear distinction from the conventional film&#8208;based binary ferroelectricity. When the FNW is mounted on a biased graphene nanoribbon (GNR), these transitions induce exotic current&#8211;voltage hysteresis in the FNW&#8211;GNR transistor. This discovery suggests new operating mechanisms of ferroelectric devices. In particular, it enables intrinsic quaternary&#8208;digit information manipulation in parallel to the bit manipulation employed in conventional data storage.

         <title>Nanoengineered Peptide&#8208;Based Antimicrobial Conductive Supramolecular Biomaterial for Cardiac Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A de novo RGD&#8208;containing peptide is shown to form self&#8208;healing and biocompatible hydrogels. Nanoengineering the network of the peptide hydrogel by polyaniline integration results in a semiconducting composite hydrogel showing excellent antibacterial properties and DNA binding ability. The composite hydrogel further supports the growth of cardiac cells into functional synchronized monolayers, thus highlighting its potential as an excellent supramolecular biomaterial.








Abstract
Owing to their dynamic nature and ordered architecture, supramolecular materials strikingly resemble organic components of living systems. Although short&#8208;peptide self&#8208;assembled nanostructured hydrogels are regarded as intriguing supramolecular materials for biotechnology, their application is often limited due to their low stability and considerable challenge of combining other desirable properties. Herein, a di&#8208;Fmoc&#8208;based hydrogelator containing the cell&#8208;adhesive Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) fragment that forms a mechanically stable, self&#8208;healing hydrogel is designed. Molecular dynamics simulation reveals the presence of RGD segments on the surface of the hydrogel fibers, highlighting their cell adherence capacity. Aiming to impart conductivity, the 3D network of the hydrogel is further nanoengineered by incorporating polyaniline (PAni). The composite hydrogels demonstrate semiconductivity, excellent antibacterial activity, and DNA binding capacity. Cardiac cells grown on the surface of the composite hydrogels form functional synchronized monolayers. Taken together, the combination of these attributes in a single hydrogel suggests it as an exceptional candidate for functional supramolecular biomaterial designed for electrogenic tissue engineering.

         <title>Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting mesostructured niobium carbonitrides with different morphologies are prepared from a single block copolymer via self&#8208;assembly using a variety of new synthetic routes. Superconducting transition temperatures are comparable to bulk analogues but vary with mesostructure, a typical fingerprint of metamaterials, while some materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches. The results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum metamaterials are expected to exhibit a variety of novel properties, but have been a major challenge to prepare as a result of the lack of appropriate synthetic routes to high&#8208;quality materials. Here, the discovery of synthesis routes to block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembly&#8208;directed niobium nitrides and carbonitrides is described. The resulting materials exhibit unusual structure retention even at temperatures as high as 1000 &#176;C and resulting critical temperature, Tc, values comparable to their bulk analogues. Applying the concepts of soft matter self&#8208;assembly, it is demonstrated that a series of four different BCP&#8208;directed mesostructured superconductors are accessible from a single triblock terpolymer. Resulting materials display a mesostructure&#8208;dependent Tc without substantial variation of the XRD&#8208;measured lattice parameters. Finally, field&#8208;dependent magnetization measurements of a sample with double&#8208;gyroid morphology show abrupt jumps comparable in overall behavior to flux avalanches. Results suggest a fruitful convergence of soft and hard condensed matter science.

         <title>Boosting the Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Activity for D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A Conjugated Microporous Polymers by Statistical Copolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocatalytic activity of D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A copolymer photocatalysts can be boosted through statistical copolymerization by varying the ratio of electron donor to acceptor, and an attractive hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 is obtained by a copolymer (10&#160;mg) with optimized polymer structure, which is also evidenced by a water&#8208;draining experiment.








Abstract
Recently, great progress has been achieved in the design and preparation of conjugated organic polymer photocatalysts for hydrogen generation. However, it is still challenging to develop an organic polymer photocatalyst with high photoconversion efficiency. Rational structure design of organic polymer photocatalysts holds the key point to realize high photocatalytic performance. Herein, a series of donor&#8211;&#960;&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;&#960;&#8211;A) conjugated organic copolymer photocatalysts is developed using statistical copolymerization by tuning the feed molar ratio of pyrene (donor) to dibenzothiophene&#8208;S,S&#8208;dioxide (acceptor) units. It reveals that the photocatalytic activity of the resulting copolymers is significantly dependent on the molar ratio of donor to acceptor, which efficiently changes the polymer structure and component. When the monomer feed ratio is 25:75, the random copolymer PyBS&#8208;3 of 10&#160;mg with Pt cocatalyst shows a high hydrogen evolution rate of 1.05&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 under UV/Vis light irradiation using ascorbic acid as the hole&#8208;scavenger, and an external quantum efficiency of 29.3% at 420&#160;nm, which represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of organic polymer photocatalysts. This work demonstrates that statistical copolymerization is an efficient strategy to optimize the polymer structure for improving the photocatalytic activity of conjugated organic polymer catalysts.

         <title>Fully 3D Printed and Disposable Paper Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fully 3D printed and disposable paper supercapacitors are designed from the bottom up by a combination of nanocellulose, biopolymers, and carbon nanomaterials leading to monolithic integrated devices with excellent electrochemical properties. The results combining digital material assembly, high performance, and nontoxicity have the potential to move the field of sustainable electronics forward.








Abstract
With the development of the internet&#8208;of&#8208;things for applications such as wearables and packaging, a new class of electronics is emerging, characterized by the sheer number of forecast units and their short service&#8208;life. Projected to reach 27 billion units in 2021, connected devices are generating an exponentially increasing amount of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste). Fueled by the growing e&#8208;waste problem, the field of sustainable electronics is attracting significant interest. Today, standard energy&#8208;storage technologies such as lithium&#8208;ion or alkaline batteries still power most of smart devices. While they provide good performance, the nonrenewable and toxic materials require dedicated collection and recycling processes. Moreover, their standardized form factor and performance specifications limit the designs of smart devices. Here, exclusively disposable materials are used to fully print nontoxic supercapacitors maintaining a high capacitance of 25.6 F&#160;g&#8722;1 active material at an operating voltage up to 1.2 V. The presented combination of digital material assembly, stable high&#8208;performance operation, and nontoxicity has the potential to open new avenues within sustainable electronics and applications such as environmental sensing, e&#8208;textiles, and healthcare.

         <title>Quicker and More Zn2+ Storage Predominantly from the Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificially constructed VOx sub&#8208;nanometer clusters/rGO composite composed of heterogeneous V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is used as a zinc&#8208;ion battery cathode, in which Zn2+ storage predominantly originates from the interface, while electron conduction occurs on the rGO. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage enables an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are highly desirable for large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their low cost and high&#8208;level safety. However, achieving high energy and high power densities simultaneously is challenging. Herein, a VOx sub&#8208;nanometer cluster/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) cathode material composed of interfacial V&#63743;O&#63743;C bonds is artificially constructed. Therein, a new mechanism is revealed, where Zn2+ ions are predominantly stored at the interface between VOx and rGO, which causes anomalous valence changes compared to conventional mechanisms and exploits the storage ability of non&#8208;energy&#8208;storing active yet highly conductive rGO. Further, this interface&#8208;dominated storage triggers decoupled transport of electrons/Zn2+ ions, and the reversible destruction/reconstruction allows the interface to store more ions than the bulk. Finally, an ultrahigh rate capability (174.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1, i.e., capacity retention of 39.4% for a 1000&#8208;fold increase in current density) and a high capacity (443 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, exceeding the theoretical capacities of each interfacial component) are achieved. Such interface&#8208;dominated storage is an exciting way to build high&#8208;energy&#8208; and high&#8208;power&#8208;density devices.

         <title>Efficient and Tunable Reflection of Phonon Polaritons at Built&#8208;In Intercalation Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embedded intercalation nanostructures are constructed in polaritonic &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes, serving as efficient and tunable reflectors for phonon polaritons. Reflected phonon polaritons with low losses exhibit propagation&#8208;dependent reflection phase shifts and propagation&#8208;independent reflectance. Both experiment and simulation results confirm that this nontrivial reflection stems from the permittivity discontinuity at the built&#8208;in interfaces, offering potential electrical tunability.








Abstract
Phonon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to lattice vibrations&#8212;in polar van der Waals crystals offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling light at the nanoscale due to their anisotropic and ultralow&#8208;loss propagation. While their analog plasmon polaritons&#8212;light coupled to electron oscillations&#8212;have long been studied and exhibit interesting reflections at geometrical edges and electronic boundaries, whether phonon polaritons can be reflected by such barriers has been elusive. Here, the effective and tunable reflection of phonon polaritons at embedded interfaces formed in hydrogen&#8208;intercalated &#945;&#8208;MoO3 flakes is elaborated upon. Without breaking geometrical continuity, such intercalation interfaces can reflect phonon polaritons with low losses, yielding the distinct phase changes of &#8722;0.8&#960; and &#8722;0.3&#960; associated with polariton propagation, high efficiency of 50%, and potential electrical tunability. The results point to a new approach to construct on&#8208;demand polariton reflectors, phase modulators, and retarders, which may be transplanted into building future polaritonic circuits using van der Waals crystals.

         <title>Abrasion Resistant/Waterproof Stretchable Triboelectric Yarns Based on Fermat Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous triboelectric yarn based on a Fermat&#8208;spiral structure has outstanding dynamic structure stability. The unique Fermat&#8208;spiral nanofibers endow this electronic yarn with excellent electrical output, abrasion resistance, and hydrophobicity, which then can collect water&#8208;droplet energy. Moreover, textiles knitted from the electronic yarn are of distinguished stretchability and breathability. This scalable yarn and textile is thus a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.








Abstract
Emerging energy harvesting yarns, via triboelectric effects, have wide application prospects in new&#8208;generation wearable electronics. However, few studies have been carried out regarding simultaneously achieving high electrical performance, mechanical robustness, and comfortability in industrial&#8208;scalable yarn. Here, an electronic yarn twisted into Fermat spiral, which has outstanding dynamic structure stability, is reported. The Fermat&#8208;spiral&#8208;based energy yarns (FSBEY) can simultaneously realize ultrahigh abrasion resistance (over 5000 Martindale standard abrasion cycles), stable reversible strain (100%), and excellent electrical output. Considerably high output (105&#160;V, &#8776;1.2 &#181;A under 2&#160;Hz) can be attained upon contacting a single yarn (30&#160;cm) with latex material, which is superior to most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable triboelectric yarns. The application of these FSBEY in wireless gesture recognition, smart screen information protection, and harvesting of energy from water dropletsis demonstrated. Moreover, textiles knitted from the FSBEY have distinguished waterproof nature and are breathable. This work shows a feasible proposal for building future &#8220;energy garments&#8221;.

         <title>Uniform Magnesium Electrodeposition via Synergistic Coupling of Current Homogenization, Geometric Confinement, and Chemisorption Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction, a 3D vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber array structure on carbon cloth can regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition and realize a reversible magnesium&#8208;metal anode with high areal capacity, much better kinetics, and improved cycle life.








Abstract
Unevenly distributed magnesium (Mg) electrodeposits have emerged as a major obstacle for Mg&#8208;metal batteries. A comprehensive design matrix is reported for 3D magnesiophilic hosts, which regulate the uniform Mg electrodeposition through a synergistic coupling of homogenizing current distribution, geometric confinement, and chemisorptive interaction. Vertically aligned nitrogen&#8208; and oxygen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber arrays on carbon cloth (denoted as &#8220;VNCA@C&#8221;) are developed as a proof of concept. The evenly arranged short nanoarray architecture helps to homogenize the surface current density and the microchannels built in this 3D host allow the preferential nucleation of Mg due to their geometrical confinement effect. Besides, the nitrogen&#8208;/oxygen&#8208;doped carbon species exhibit strong chemisorptive interaction toward Mg atoms, providing preferential nucleation sites as demonstrated by first&#8208;principle calculation results. Electrochemical analysis reveals a peculiar yet highly reversible microchannel&#8208;filling growth&#160;behavior of Mg metals, which empowers the delicately designed VNCA@C host with the ability to deliver a reduced nucleation overpotential of 429&#160;mV at 10.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and an elongated Mg plating/stripping cycle life (110 cycles) under high current density of 10.0 mA cm&#8722;2. The proposed design matrix can be extended to other metal anodes (such as lithium and zinc) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Tough&#8208;Hydrogel Reinforced Low&#8208;Tortuosity Conductive Networks for Stretchable and High&#8208;Performance Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultratough hydrogel reinforcement coating enables a tough and stretchable isotopically low tortuous conductive network. The micro&#8208;open&#8208;porous material demonstrates simultaneously high mechanical robustness, high capacitance, energy and power density when applied as capacitive electrodes. The presented strategy promotes the development of stretchable energy storage devices and opens up new possibilities for the application of tough hydrogels.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state supercapacitors are seeing emerging applications in flexible and stretchable electronics. Supercapacitors with high capacitance, high power density, simple form factor, and good mechanical robustness are highly desired, which demands electrode materials with high surface area, high mass loading, good conductivity, larger thickness, low tortuosity, and high toughness. However, it has been challenging to simultaneously realize them in a single material. By compositing a superficial layer of tough hydrogel on conductive and low tortuous foams, a thick capacitor electrode with large capacitance (5.25 F cm&#8208;2), high power density (41.28&#160;mW cm&#8208;2), and good mechanical robustness (&#949;&#160;= 140%, &#915;&#160;= 1000 J m&#8208;2) is achieved. The tough hydrogel serves as both a load&#8208;bearing layer to maintain structural integrity during deformation and a permeable binder to allow interaction between the conductive electrode and electrolyte. It is shown that the tough hydrogel reinforcement is beneficial for both electrical and mechanical stability. With a simple design and facile fabrication, this strategy is generalizable for various conductive materials.

         <title>Co3Se4 Quantum Dots as an Ultrastable Host Material for Potassium&#8208;Ion Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co3Se4 quantum dots encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for potassium&#8208;ion batteries, in which a morphology change process occurs. The unique core&#8211;shell&#8208;like&#8208;structure anode demonstrates greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, especially long&#8208;term cyclic performance at various current densities. Density functional theory calculations, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, and ex situ transmission electron microscopy further reveal the working mechanism of the CSC anode during potassiation/depotassiation.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) are receiving increased attention due to their cost&#8208;effective and similar energy&#8208;storage mechanism to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the lack of appropriate electrode materials is still hampered for their development, which is mainly caused by the large size of the potassium ions (1.38&#160;&#197;) including low structural stability and poor electrochemical redox reaction kinetics. Herein, Co3Se4 quantum dots (QD) encapsulated by N&#8208;doped carbon (CSC) are reported as an anode material for KIBs, in which a morphology change process occurs. Benefiting from the unique uniform nanostructure reducing the ion&#8208;diffusion length, the improved electronic conductivity, and the enhanced protective effect of N&#8208;doped carbon (NC) alleviating volume fluctuation, the CSC demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance. The core&#8211;shell&#8208;like CSC composite demonstrates remarkable discharge capacity (410&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 550 cycles, 360&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 after 3200 cycles) and excellent cyclic performance over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Density functional theory calculations show a larger reaction energy of Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, a lower barrier of K atom migration in Co3Se4 QD than bulk Co3Se4, and also favor the intercalation reaction rather than replacement reaction. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ transmission electron microscopy are further used to evaluate potassiation/depotassiation phenomena.

A critical assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided and practical guidelines offered toward developing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing needs for renewable energy demand the pursuit of batteries with higher energy/power output. A thick electrode design is considered as a promising solution for high&#8208;energy batteries due to the minimized inactive material ratio at the device level. Most of the current research focuses on pushing the electrode thickness to a maximum limit; however, very few of them thoroughly analyze the effect of electrode thickness on cell&#8208;level energy densities as well as the balance between energy and power density. Here, a realistic assessment of the combined effect of electrode thickness with other key design parameters is provided, such as active material fraction and electrode porosity, which affect the cell&#8208;level energy/power densities of lithium&#8211;LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (Li&#8211;NMC622) and lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) cells as two model battery systems, is provided. Based on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lithium batteries, key research targets are quantified to achieve 500&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1/800&#160;Wh L&#8211;1 cell&#8208;level energy densities and strategies are elaborated to simultaneously enhance energy/power output. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are highlighted toward realizing scalable high&#8208;energy/power energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>An Efficient Narrowband Near&#8208;Infrared at 1040&#160;nm Organic Photodetector Realized by Intermolecular Charge Transfer Mediated Coupling Based on a Squaraine Dye</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband near&#8208;infrared organic photodiodes are reported based on a dipolar squaraine dye. J&#8208;type coupling in the solid state allows SQ&#8208;H thin films to combine favorable NIR absorption at 1040&#160;nm and charge carrier mobility. The bulk&#8208;heterojunction with PC61BM yields an organic photodiode with external quantum efficiency of 12.3% at 1050&#160;nm with a full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 85&#160;nm under short&#8208;circuit condition.








Abstract
A highly sensitive short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, &#955;&#160;&gt; 1000 nm) organic photodiode (OPD) is described based on a well&#8208;organized nanocrystalline bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) active layer composed of a dicyanovinyl&#8208;functionalized squaraine dye (SQ&#8208;H) donor material in combination with PC61BM. Through thermal annealing, dipolar SQ&#8208;H chromophores self&#8208;assemble in a nanoscale structure with intermolecular charge transfer mediated coupling, resulting in a redshifted and narrow absorption band at 1040 nm as well as enhanced charge carrier mobility. The optimized OPD exhibits an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.3% and a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of only 85 nm (815 cm&#8722;1) at 1050 nm under 0 V, which is the first efficient SWIR OPD based on J&#8208;type aggregates. Photoplethysmography application for heart&#8208;rate monitoring is successfully demonstrated on flexible substrates without applying reverse bias, indicating the potential of OPDs based on short&#8208;range coupled dye aggregates for low&#8208;power operating wearable applications.

         <title>Digital Electrochemistry for On&#8208;Chip Heterogeneous Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel digital electrochemistry approach is proposed, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical reactions to deposit electroactive materials. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.








Abstract
Many modern electronic applications rely on functional units arranged in an active&#8208;matrix integrated on a single chip. The active&#8208;matrix allows numerous identical device pixels to be addressed within a single system. However, next&#8208;generation electronics requires heterogeneous integration of dissimilar devices, where sensors, actuators, and display pixels sense and interact with the local environment. Heterogeneous material integration allows the reduction of size, increase of functionality, and enhancement of performance; however, it is challenging since front&#8208;end fabrication technologies in microelectronics put extremely high demands on materials, fabrication protocols, and processing environments. To overcome the obstacle in heterogeneous material integration, digital electrochemistry is explored here, which site&#8208;selectively carries out electrochemical processes to deposit and address electroactive materials within the pixel array. More specifically, an amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (a&#8208;IGZO) thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. The digital electrochemistry procedure is studied in&#8208;depth by using polypyrrole (PPy) as a model material. Active&#8208;matrix&#8208;driven multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays are fabricated to demonstrate the capabilities of this approach for material integration. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

         <title>Supercapacitors: Fully 3D Printed and Disposable Paper Supercapacitors (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
To power the next generation of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things devices invading our homes, fully printed and disposable power supplies are envisioned. In article number 2101328, sustainable supercapacitors are designed from the bottom up by Gustav Nystr&#246;m and co&#8208;workers, featuring a foldable design while being mainly composed of wood&#8208;derived materials. The monolithically integrated devices exhibit excellent electrochemical properties and combine digital material assembly, mechanical stability, and non&#8208;toxicity.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triboelectric nanogenerators can efficiently convert biomechanical motion into a characteristically high voltage and low current whilst avoiding collateral heat production, which is known to lead to detrimental localized side effects. The use of triboelectric nanogenerators for electrical stimulation has been validated and demonstrated to be useful in enhancing numerous tissue regeneration processes within the human body to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Such systems are reviewed by Jun Chen and co&#8208;workers in article number 2007502.

         <title>Neurofiber Transistors: Dendritic Network Implementable Organic Neurofiber Transistors with Enhanced Memory Cyclic Endurance for Spatiotemporal Iterative Learning (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dendritic neural&#8208;network implementable organic neurofiber transistors with enhanced memory cyclic endurance for spatiotemporal iterative learning are developed by Hyunsu Ju, Jung Ah Lim, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2100475. These neurofiber transistors consisting of a double&#8208;stranded assembly of electrode microfibers and an iongel gate insulator enable a multichannel synaptic junction of a neural network via simple physical contact of gate&#8208;electrode microfibers, as the dendritic connections of a biological neuron fiber. This work provides insight into the design of the materials and architecture of organic neuromorphic devices with reliable artificial synaptic functionality for artificial neural network learning.

         <title>Mesoporous Superconductors: Superconducting Quantum Metamaterials from Convergence of Soft and Hard Condensed Matter Science (Adv. Mater. 26/2021)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number 2006975, mesoporous superconductors are prepared by Ulrich Wiesner and co&#8208;workers via solution&#8208;based block&#8208;copolymer self&#8208;assembly leading to high&#8208;quality quantum metamaterials. The full promise of this soft&#8208;materials approach is realized by producing superconductors with four different mesoscale morphologies. In these materials, the superconducting transition temperatures show variations with mesoscale structure despite nearly identical atomic crystal lattices. The materials exhibit atypical flux avalanches, characteristic of granular materials.

In article number 2101272, Bin Bao, Daniil Karnaushenko, Oliver G. Schmidt, and co&#8208;workers develop a digital electrochemistry approach for on&#8208;chip heterogeneous material integration. An amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor (a&#8208;IGZO TFT) active&#8208;matrix is used to address pixels within the matrix and locally control electrochemical reactions for material growth and actuation. Multicolored electrochromic patterns and actuator arrays can be fabricated. The approach can be extended to a broad range of materials and structures, opening up a new path for advanced heterogeneous microsystem integration.

         <title>Electronic Modulation of Non&#8208;van der Waals 2D Electrocatalysts for Efficient Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A critical review of the progress on non&#8208;ven der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D electrocatalysts is presented. Specifically, strategies for engineering the electronic structure of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts toward the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, etc., are comprehensively summarized, along with a perspective for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The exploration of efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion is important for green energy development. Owing to their high surface areas and unusual electronic structure, 2D electrocatalysts have attracted increasing interest. Among them, non&#8208;van der Waals (non&#8208;vdW) 2D materials with numerous chemical bonds in all three dimensions and novel chemical and electronic properties beyond those of vdW 2D materials have been studied increasingly over the past decades. Herein, the progress of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is critically reviewed, with a special emphasis on electronic structure modulation. Strategies for heteroatom doping, vacancy engineering, pore creation, alloying, and heterostructure engineering are analyzed for tuning electronic structures and achieving intrinsically enhanced electrocatalytic performances. Lastly, a roadmap for the future development of non&#8208;vdW 2D electrocatalysts is provided from material, mechanism, and performance viewpoints.

         <title>Recent Progress of Chiral Perovskites: Materials, Synthesis, and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral perovskites are considered to be a promising class of materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices, owing to their superiority in combining chirality and high dielectric constants, high optical&#8208;absorption coefficients, and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. The synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, physical properties, and applications of chiral perovskites are reviewed.








Abstract
Chiral materials with intrinsic inversion&#8208;symmetric structures possess many unique physicochemical features, including circular dichroism, circularly polarized photoluminescence, nonlinear optics, ferroelectricity, and spintronics. Halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties, which are particularly suitable for realizing high power&#8208;conversion efficiency in solar cells. Recent studies have shown that chirality can be transferred from chiral organic ligands into halide perovskites and the resultant chiral perovskites combine the advantages of both chiral materials and halide perovskites; this provides an ideal platform to design next&#8208;generation optoelectronic and spintronic devices. In this progress report, the most recent advances are summarized in various chemical structures of chiral perovskites, their synthesis strategies, chirality generation mechanisms, and physical properties. Furthermore, the potential chiral&#8208;halide&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications are presented and the challenges and prospects of chiral perovskites are discussed. This report outlines the diverse construction strategies of and proposes research directions for chiral halide perovskites; thus, it provides insights into the design of novel chiral perovskites and facilitates investigation of the optoelectronic applications that employ chirality.

         <title>Advances in Application of Azobenzene as a Trigger in Biomedicine: Molecular Design and Spontaneous Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of numerous studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use.

Abstract
Azobenzene is a well&#8208;known derivative of stimulus&#8208;responsive molecular switches and has shown superior performance as a functional material in biomedical applications. The results of multiple studies have led to the development of light/hypoxia&#8208;responsive azobenzene for biomedical use. In recent years, long&#8208;wavelength&#8208;responsive azobenzene has been developed. Matching the longer wavelength absorption and hypoxia&#8208;response characteristics of the azobenzene switch unit to the bio&#8208;optical window results in a large and effective stimulus response. In addition, azobenzene has been used as a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive connector via biological cleavage under appropriate stimulus conditions. This has resulted in on/off state switching of properties such as pharmacology and fluorescence activity. Herein, recent advances in the design and fabrication of azobenzene as a trigger in biomedicine are summarized.

         <title>Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Therapeutic Electrical Stimulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, the recent invention of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) allows for self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic solutions. Research on in&#8208; and on&#8208;body TENGs applied for electrical stimulation therapeutics in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering is detailed.








Abstract
Current solutions developed for the purpose of in and on body (IOB) electrical stimulation (ES) lack autonomous qualities necessary for comfortable, practical, and self&#8208;dependent use. Consequently, recent focus has been placed on developing self&#8208;powered IOB therapeutic devices capable of generating therapeutic ES for human use. With the recent invention of the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), harnessing passive human biomechanical energy to develop self&#8208;powered systems has allowed for the introduction of novel therapeutic ES solutions. TENGs are especially effective at providing ES for IOB therapeutic systems given their bioconformability, low cost, simple manufacturability, and self&#8208;powering capabilities. Due to the key role of naturally induced electrical signals in many physiological functions, TENG&#8208;induced ES holds promise to provide a novel paradigm in therapeutic interventions. The aim here is to detail research on IOB TENG devices applied for ES&#8208;based therapy in the fields of regenerative medicine, neurology, rehabilitation, and pharmaceutical engineering. Furthermore, considering TENG&#8208;produced ES can be measured for sensing applications, this technology is paving the way to provide a fully autonomous personalized healthcare system, capable of IOB energy generation, sensing, and therapeutic intervention. Considering these grounds, it seems highly relevant to review TENG&#8208;ES research and applications, as they could constitute the foundation and future of personalized healthcare.

         <title>Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Photodetectors: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 26, July 1, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle for lead&#8208;free perovskites and the progress of typical lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed and discussed. The outlook for future research and applications is then explored.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photodetectors which apply hybrid perovskite materials have emerged as powerful candidates for next&#8208;generation light sensing. Among them, lead&#8208;based ones are the most popular beyond doubt on account of their unique and superior optoelectronic properties. Nevertheless, trade&#8208;off toward commercialization exists between nontoxicity and high performance, with the poor stability of lead&#8208;based perovskites, indicating that it is indispensable to substitute lead with nontoxic element meanwhile bringing about a comparable figure of merit of photodetectors and relatively long&#8208;term stability. Herein, recent advances in lead&#8208;free perovskite photodetectors are reviewed, analyzing the principle while designing new materials and highlighting some remarkable progress, which are comparable, even superior, to lead&#8208;based photodetectors. Furthermore, their potential strategy in optical communication, image sensing, narrowband photodetection, etc., is examined and a perspective on developing new materials and photodetectors with superior properties for more practical applications is provided.
