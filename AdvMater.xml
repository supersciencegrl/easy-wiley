         <title>Rapid&#8208;Response Water&#8208;Shrink Films with High Output Work Density Based on Polyethylene Oxide and &#945;&#8208;Cyclodextrin for Autonomous Wound Closure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;shrink film (WS film) with supercontraction, constructed by poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, is demonstrated. Upon wetting, this film rapidly contracts, generating substantial contraction stress and a high output work density. Water&#8208;shrink tapes, based on this supercontractile film, autonomously close the bleeding wound, offering an innovative approach for self&#8208;treatment, especially in urgent self&#8208;care scenarios.








Abstract
Conventional wound closure methods, including sutures and tissue adhesives, present significant challenges for self&#8208;care treatment, particularly in the context of bleeding wounds. Existing stimuli&#8208;responsive contractile materials designed for autonomous wound closure frequently lack sufficient output work density to generate the force needed to bring the wound edges into proximity or necessitate stimuli that are not compatible with the human body. Here, semi&#8208;transparent, flexible, and water&#8208;responsive shrinkable films, composed of poly(ethylene oxide) and &#945;&#8208;cyclodextrin, are reported. These films exhibit remarkable stability under ambient conditions and demonstrate significant contraction (&#8776;50%) within 6 s upon exposure to water, generating substantial contractile stress (up to 6&#160;MPa) and output work density (&#8776;1028&#160;kJ m&#8722;3), which is 100 times larger than that of conventional hydrogel and 25 times larger than that of skeletal muscles. Remarkably, upon hydration, these films are capable of lifting objects 10&#160;000 times their own weight. Leveraging this technology, water&#8208;shrink tapes, which, upon contact with water, effectively constrict human skin and autonomously close bleeding wounds in animal models within 10 seconds, are developed further. This work offers a novel approach to skin wound management, showing significant potential for emergency and self&#8208;care scenarios.

         <dc:description>
This review emphasizes the significance of heterointerfaces, which present new opportunities for enhanced capacity and rapid mass transfer dynamics in energy storage electrodes, attributed to the localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;. Fresh insights into fundamental principles, working mechanisms, dynamic evolution mechanisms, and feasible design strategies governing heterointerfaces are systematically discussed.








Abstract
Heterogeneous electrode materials possess abundant heterointerfaces with a localized &#8220;space charge effect&#8221;, which enhances capacity output and accelerates mass/charge transfer dynamics in energy storage devices (ESDs). These promising features open new possibilities for demanding applications such as electric vehicles, grid energy storage, and portable electronics. However, the fundamental principles and working mechanisms that govern heterointerfaces are not yet fully understood, impeding the rational design of electrode materials. In this study, the heterointerface evolution during charging and discharging process as well as the intricate interaction between heterointerfaces and charge/mass transport phenomena, is systematically discussed. Guidelines along with feasible strategies for engineering structural heterointerfaces to address specific challenges encountered in various application scenarios, are also provided. This review offers innovative solutions for the development of heterogeneous electrode materials, enabling more efficient energy storage beyond conventional electrochemistry. Furthermore, it provides fresh insights into the advancement of clean energy conversion and storage technologies. This review contributes to the knowledge and understanding of heterointerfaces, paving the way for the design and optimization of next&#8208;generation energy storage materials for a sustainable future.

Citrate&#8208;based biodegradable polymers represent a distinctive biomaterial platform with tremendous potential for diverse medical applications. With their versatile chemistry, these polymers exhibit a broad range of material and bioactive properties and regulate cell metabolism and stem cell differentiation.

Abstract
Citrate&#8208;based biodegradable polymers have emerged as a distinctive biomaterial platform with tremendous potential for diverse medical applications. By harnessing their versatile chemistry, these polymers exhibit a wide range of material and bioactive properties, enabling them to regulate cell metabolism and stem cell differentiation through energy metabolism, metabonegenesis, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. Moreover, the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance of the biodegradable poly(octamethylene citrate) (POC)/hydroxyapatite&#8208;based orthopedic fixation devices represents a translational research milestone for biomaterial science. POC joins a short list of biodegradable synthetic polymers that have ever been authorized by the FDA for use in humans. The clinical success of POC has sparked enthusiasm and accelerated the development of next&#8208;generation citrate&#8208;based biomaterials. This review presents a comprehensive, forward&#8208;thinking discussion on the pivotal role of citrate chemistry and metabolism in various tissue regeneration and on the development of functional citrate&#8208;based metabotissugenic biomaterials for regenerative engineering applications.

         <title>Molecule Crowding Strategy in Polymer Electrolytes Inducing Stable Interfaces for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molecule crowding effect caused by 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5&#160;leads to the abundant anions are forcing into the Li+ coordinated sheath to form anion&#8208;rich coordinated structure, which weakens the Li+ coordination and consequently boosts the Li+ transport. The confined anions decomposed at electrode/electrolyte interfaces to forming stable SEI and CEI, which achieve uniform lithium deposition, prevent electrolytes' continuous degradation, and suppress transition&#8208;metal crosstalk.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries with polymer electrolytes suffer from electrolyte decomposition and lithium dendrites because of the unstable electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Herein, a molecule crowding strategy is proposed to modulate the Li+ coordinated structure, thus in situ constructing the stable interfaces. Since 15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 possesses superior compatibility with polymer and electrostatic repulsion for anion of lithium salt, the anions are forced to crowd into a Li+ coordinated structure to weaken the Li+ coordination with polymer and boost the Li+ transport. The coordinated anions prior decompose to form LiF&#8208;rich, thin, and tough interfacial passivation layers for stabilizing the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Thus, the symmetric Li&#8211;Li cell can stably operate over 4360&#160;h, the LiFePO4||Li full battery presents 97.18% capacity retention in 700 cycles at 2&#160;C, and the NCM811||Li full battery possesses the capacity retention of 83.17% after 300 cycles. The assembled pouch cell shows excellent flexibility (stand for folding over 2000 times) and stability (89.42% capacity retention after 400 cycles). This work provides a promising strategy to regulate interfacial chemistry by modulating the ion environment to accommodate the interfacial issues and will inspire more effective approaches to general interface issues for polymer electrolytes.

         <title>Inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect of Manganese Hexacyanoferrate via Ni and Cu Codoping for Advanced Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nickel&#8208; and copper&#8208;doped manganese&#8208;based Prussian blue cathode undergoes a reversible phase transition from monoclinic to cubic phase during the charge and discharge process, which exhibits excellent cycling stability as cathode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Manganese (Mn)&#8208;based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis, and low cost. However, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn&#8208;based PBA cause poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, a novel nickel&#8208; and copper&#8208;codoped K2Mn[Fe(CN)6] cathode is developed via a simple coprecipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn&#8208;based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared Mn&#8208;based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.01 A g&#8722;1) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1).

     alt="Inhibiting the Jahn&#8211;Teller Effect of Manganese Hexacyanoferrate via Ni and Cu Codoping for Advanced Sodium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nickel- and copper-doped manganese-based Prussian blue cathode undergoes a reversible phase transition from monoclinic to cubic phase during the charge and discharge process, which exhibits excellent cycling stability as cathode for sodium-ion batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manganese (Mn)-based Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are of great interest as a prospective cathode material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) due to their high redox potential, easy synthesis, and low cost. However, the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect and low electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA cause poor structure stability and unsatisfactory performance during the cycling. Herein, a novel nickel- and copper-codoped K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mn[Fe(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;] cathode is developed via a simple coprecipitation strategy. The doping elements improve the electrical conductivity of Mn-based PBA by reducing the bandgap, as well as suppress the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect by stabilizing the framework, as verified by the density functional theory calculations. Simultaneously, the substitution of sodium with potassium in the lattice is beneficial for filling vacancies in the PBA framework, leading to higher average operating voltages and superior structural stability. As a result, the as-prepared Mn-based cathode exhibits excellent reversible capacity (116.0 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.01 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and superior cycling stability (81.8% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 0.1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work provides a profitable doping strategy to inhibit the Jahn&#8211;Teller structural deformation for designing stable cathode material of SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong&#8208;Yet&#8208;Ductile Eutectic Alloys Employing Cocoon&#8208;Like Nanometer&#8208;Sized Dislocation Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strong&#8208;yet&#8208;ductile alloys require effective microstructural mechanisms for regulating dislocation evolution, to constantly impart strengthening and strain hardening while suppressing damage during tensile deformation. All these are achieved simultaneously in this work, by invoking a novel cocoon&#8208;like nano&#8208;meshed structure, an unusual arrangement of accumulated dislocations anchored by dense pre&#8208;existing nanoprecipitates into nanometer&#8208;scale thin&#8208;walled cells, thereby leading to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art eutectic alloys.








Abstract
Eutectic alloys (EAs) with superior fluidity are known to be the easiest to cast into high&#8208;quality ingots, making them the alloys of choice for making large&#8208;sized structural parts. However, conventional EAs (CEAs) have never reached strength&#8211;ductility combinations on par with the best in other alloy categories. Via thermomechanical processing of cast Ni&#8208;32.88wt%Fe&#8208;9.53wt%Al CEAs, a cocoon&#8208;like nano&#8208;meshed (as fine as 26&#8201;nm) network of dislocations (CNN&#8208;D) is produced via recovery annealing, through the rearrangement of cold&#8208;work&#8208;accumulated dislocations anchored by dense pre&#8208;existing nanoprecipitates. In lieu of traditional plasticity mechanisms, such as TWIP and TRIP, the CNN&#8208;D is particularly effective in eutectic lamellae with alternating phases, as it instigates nanometer&#8208;spaced planar slip bands that not only dynamically refine the microstructure but also transmit from the FCC (face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic) layers into the otherwise brittle B2 layers. These additional mechanisms for strengthening and strain hardening sustain stable tensile flow, resulting in a striking elevation of both strength and ductility to outrank not only all previous CEAs, but also the state of the art&#8212;additively manufactured eutectic high&#8208;entropy alloys. The CNN&#8208;D thus adds a novel microstructural strategy for performance enhancement, especially for compositionally complex alloys that increasingly make use of nanoprecipitates or local chemical order.

         <title>Van der Waals Encapsulation by Ultra&#8208;thin Oxide for Air&#8208;Sensitive 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The ambient stability is one of the focal points for applications of 2D materials, especially for those well&#8208;known air&#8208;sensitive ones such as black phosphorus (BP) and transitional metal telluride. Traditional methods of encapsulation, such as atomic layer deposition of oxides and heterogeneous integration of hexagonal boron nitride, can hardly avoid removal of encapsulation layer when the 2D materials are encapsulated for further device fabrication, which causes complexity and damage during the procedure. Here, a van der Waals encapsulation method that allows direct device fabrication without removal of encapsulation layer is introduced using Ga2O3 from liquid gallium. Taking advantage of the robust isolation ability against ambient environment of the dense native oxide of gallium, hundreds of times longer retention time of (opto)electronic properties of encapsulated BP and MoTe2 devices is realized than unencapsulated devices. Due to the ultra&#8208;thin high&#8208;&#954; properties of Ga2O3, top&#8208;gated devices are directly fabricated with the encapsulation layer, simultaneously as a dielectric layer. This direct device fabrication is realized by selective etching of Ga2O3, leaving the encapsulated materials intact. Encapsulated 1T' MoTe2 exhibits high conductivity even after 150 days in ambient environment. This method is therefore highlighted as a promising and distinctive one compared with traditional passivation approaches.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Electrical Bandage Based on Body&#8208;Coupled Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative SEB based on high&#8208;permittivity P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposites is designed to provide autonomous and effective electrical treatment that accelerates wound healing by leveraging body&#8208;coupled energy harvesting from ambient 60&#8208;Hz EM waves. Combining human&#8208;centered energy solution and flexible, skin&#8208;conformable design, this work suggests the potential of the SEB as a straightforward, convenient, and practical wound care apparatus.








Abstract
Self&#8208;powered electrical bandages (SEBs), integrated with wearable energy harvesters, can provide an effective and autonomous electrical stimulation (ES) solution for rapid and scarless wound healing. A continuously operating, wireless, and applicable&#8208;to&#8208;comprehensive&#8208;wound ES device is essential for the quick restoration of wounds and convenience. This work illustrates a SEB powered by body&#8208;coupled energy harvesting. The SEB continuously treats the wound with 60&#8208;Hz sinusoidal electrical potential gained from the coupling of the human body and ambient electrical waves. It is demonstrated that enough level of electrical potential can be applied to the wound, further enhanced by strong capacitive coupling arising from the use of high&#8208;permittivity poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene):CaCu3Ti4O12 (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE):CCTO) nanocomposite. The potential clinical efficacy of the SEB is illustrated by preclinical analysis of human fibroblasts and mouse wound model, thus confirming the successful expedition of wound recovery. This work suggests a new class of wearable devices to provide ES events and its potential for extension to other conventional wound care materials and device technology.

         <title>A Thermo&#8208;responsive MOFs for X&#8208;ray Scintillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Thermo&#8208;responsive smart materials have aroused extensive interests due to the particular significance of temperature sensing. Although various photoluminescent materials have been explored in thermal detection, it is not applicable enough in X&#8208;ray radiation environment where the accuracy and reliability would be influenced. Here, we purpose a strategy by introducing the concept of radio&#8208;luminescence functional building units (RBUs) to construct thermo&#8208;responsive lanthanide metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) scintillators for self&#8208;calibrating thermometry. The rational designs of RBUs (including organic ligand and Tb3+/Eu3+) with appropriate energy levels lead to high&#8208;performance radio&#8208;luminescence. Ln&#8208;MOFs scintillators exhibit prefect linear response to X&#8208;ray, presenting low dose rate detection limit (min &#8764; 156.1 nGyairs&#8208;1). Self&#8208;calibrating detection based on ratiometric XEL intensities is achieved with good absolute and relative sensitivities of 6.74 and 8.1%K&#8208;1, respectively. High relative light yield (max &#8764; 39000 photons MeV&#8722;1), imaging spatial resolution (max &#8764; 18 lp&#183;mm&#8208;1), irradiation stability (intensity &#8764; 100% at 368 K in total dose up to 215 Gyair), and giant color transformation visualization benefit the applications, especially the in&#8208;situ thermo&#8208;responsive X&#8208;ray imaging. Such strategy provides a promising way to develop the novel smart photonic materials with excellent scintillator performances.

         <title>Highly Reversible Positive&#8208;Valence Conversion of Sulfur Chemistry for High&#8208;Voltage Zinc&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Sulfur is a promising conversion&#8208;type cathode for zinc batteries (ZBs) due to its high discharge capacity and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the redox conversion of multivalent S in ZBs is still limited, only having achieved S0/S2&#8722; redox conversion with low discharge voltage and poor reversibility. This study presents significant progress by demonstrating, for the first time, the reversible S2&#8722;/S4+ redox behavior in ZBs with up to six&#8208;electron transfer (with an achieved discharge capacity of &#8764;1284 mAh g&#8722;1) using a highly concentrated ClO4&#8722;&#8208;containing electrolyte. The developed succinonitrile&#8208;Zn(ClO4)2 eutectic electrolyte stabilizes the positive&#8208;valence S compound and contributes to an ultra&#8208;low polarization voltage. Notably, the achieved flat discharge plateaus demonstrate the highest operation voltage (1.54&#160;V) achieved to date in Zn&#8214;S batteries. Furthermore, the high&#8208;voltage Zn&#8214;S battery exhibits remarkable conversion dynamics, excellent cycling performance (85.7% capacity retention after 500 cycles), high efficiency (98.4%), and energy density (527&#160;Wh KgS&#8722;1). This strategy of positive&#8208;valence conversion of sulfur represents a significant advancement in understanding sulfur chemistry in batteries and holds promise for future high&#8208;voltage sulfur&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Inner Doping of Carbon Nanotubes with Perovskites for Ultralow Power Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been considered as the most promising channel material to construct ultra&#8208;scaled field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), but the perfect sp2 C&#8208;C structure makes stable doping difficult, which limits the electrical designability of CNT devices. Here, an inner doping method was developed by filling CNTs with one&#8208;dimensional (1D) halide perovskites to form a coaxial heterojunction, which enables a stable n&#8208;type field&#8208;effect transistor (CNT&#8208;FET) for constructing complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. Most importantly, a quasi&#8208;broken gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field&#8208;effect transistor (TFET) was first demonstrated based on an individual partial&#8208;filling CsPbBr3/CNT and exhibited a subthreshold swing of 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with a high on&#8208;state current of up to 4.9&#160;&#956;A/tube and an on/off current ratio of up to 105 at room temperature. The quasi&#8208;BG TFET based on the CsPbBr3/CNT coaxial heterojunction paves the way for constructing high&#8208;performance and ultralow power consumption ICs.

&lt;p&gt;Semiconducting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been considered as the most promising channel material to construct ultra-scaled field-effect transistors (FETs), but the perfect sp2 C-C structure makes stable doping difficult, which limits the electrical designability of CNT devices. Here, an inner doping method was developed by filling CNTs with one-dimensional (1D) halide perovskites to form a coaxial heterojunction, which enables a stable n-type field-effect transistor (CNT-FET) for constructing complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) electronics. Most importantly, a quasi-broken gap (BG) heterojunction tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) was first demonstrated based on an individual partial-filling CsPbBr3/CNT and exhibited a subthreshold swing of 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 with a high on-state current of up to 4.9&#160;&#956;A/tube and an on/off current ratio of up to 105 at room temperature.

         <title>Recent Advances in 3D Printing of Smart Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering and Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The repair and functional reconstruction of bone defects resulting from severe trauma, surgical resection, degenerative disease, and congenital malformation pose significant clinical challenges. Bone tissue engineering (BTE) holds immense potential in treating these severe bone defects, without incurring prevalent complications associated with conventional autologous or allogeneic bone grafts. Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing technology enables control over architectural structures at multiple length scales and has been extensively employed to process biomimetic scaffolds for BTE. In contrast to inert and functional bone grafts, next&#8208;generation smart scaffolds possess remarkable ability to mimic the dynamic nature of native extracellular matrix (ECM), thereby facilitating bone repair and regeneration. Additionally, they can generate tailored and controllable therapeutic effects, such as antibacterial or antitumor properties, in response to exogenous and/or endogenous stimuli. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of the progress of 3D&#8208;printed smart scaffolds for BTE applications. It begins with an introduction to bone physiology, followed by an overview of 3D printing technologies utilized for smart scaffolds. Notable advances in various stimuli&#8208;responsive strategies, therapeutic efficacy, and applications of 3D&#8208;printed smart scaffolds are discussed. Finally, the review highlights the existing challenges in the development and clinical implementation of smart scaffolds, as well as emerging technologies in this field.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures: Basic Physics and Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the face of escalating modern data storage demands and the constraints of Moore's Law, exploring spintronic solutions, particularly the devices based on magnetic skyrmions, has emerged as a promising frontier in scientific research. Since the first experimental observation of skyrmions, topological spin textures have been extensively studied for their great potential as efficient information carriers in spintronic devices. However, significant challenges have emerged alongside this progress. This review aims to synthesize recent advances in skyrmion research while addressing the major issues encountered in the field. Additionally, we summarize current research on promising topological spin structures in addition to skyrmions. Beyond two&#8208;dimensional structures, exploration also extends to one&#8208;dimensional magnetic solitons and three&#8208;dimensional spin textures. In addition, we introduce a diverse array of emerging magnetic materials, including antiferromagnets and two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals magnets, broadening the scope of potential materials hosting topological spin textures. Through a systematic examination of magnetic principles, topological categorization, and the dynamics of spin textures, we offer a comprehensive overview of experimental and theoretical advances in the research of topological magnetism. Finally, we summarize both conventional and unconventional applications based on spin textures proposed thus far. This review provides an outlook on future development in applied spintronics.

         <title>Diatom Cribellum&#8208;inspired Hierarchical Metamaterials: Unifying Perfect Absorption Towards Subwavelength Color Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Diatom exoskeletons, known as frustules, exhibit a unique multilayer structure that has attracted considerable attention across interdisciplinary research fields as a source of biomorphic inspiration. These frustules possess a hierarchical porous structure, ranging from millimeter&#8208;scale foramen pores to nanometer&#8208;scale cribellum pores. In this study, we leverage this natural template for nanopattern design to showcase metamaterials that integrates perfect absorption and subwavelength color printing. The cribellum&#8208;inspired hierarchical nanopatterns, organized in a hexagonal unit cell with a periodicity of 300&#160;nm, are realized through a single&#8208;step electron beam lithography process. By employing numerical models, we uncover that an additional induced collective dipole mode is the key mechanism responsible for achieving outstanding performance in absorption, reaching up to 99%. Analysis of the hierarchical organization reveals that variations in nanoparticle diameter and inter&#8208;unit&#8208;cell distance lead to shifts and broadening of the resonance peaks. We also demonstrate that the hierarchical nanopatterns are capable of color reproduction with high uniformity and fidelity, serving as hexagonal pixels for high&#8208;resolution color printing. These cribellum&#8208;inspired metamaterials offer a novel approach to multifunctional metamaterial design, presenting aesthetic potential applications in the development of robotics and wearable electronic devices, such as smart skin or surface coatings integrated with energy harvesting functionalities.

         <title>Ultrafast Interfacial Self&#8208;Assembly toward Bioderived Polyester COF Membranes with Microstructure Optimization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The precise manipulation of the microstructure (pore size, free volume distribution, and connectivity of the free&#8208;volume elements), thickness and mechanical characteristics of membranes holds paramount significance in facilitating the effective utilization of self&#8208;standing membranes within intricate molecular sieving applications within the chemical industry. In this contribution, we first report the synthesis of two innovative ester&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF) membranes, which were generated through the selection of plant&#8208;derived ellagic acid and quercetin phenolic monomers in conjunction with terephthaloyl chloride as a building block. The optimization of the microstructure of these two self&#8208;standing, plant&#8208;derived COF membranes was systematically achieved through the application of three different interfacial electric field systems: electric neutrality (without surfactants), positive electricity (positively charged surfactants) and negative electricity (negatively charged surfactants). It was observed that the positively charged system facilitated a record increase in the rate of membrane formation, resulting in a denser membrane with a uniform pore size and enhanced flexibility compared to the membrane formed under electric neutrality and negative charge conditions. This improvement was primarily attributed to the coulomb force and uniform orientation of the surfactants at the n&#8208;hexane/water interface. In addition, a correlation was identified wherein an increase in the alkyl chain length of the surfactants led to a more uniform pore size and a decrease in the molecular weight cutoff (MWCO) of the COF membrane, which is attributed to the formation of a hydrophobic microenvironment resulting in the presence of fewer water molecules. When the surfactant chain length continued to increase, the membrane pore size increased. The resulting COF membrane exhibited an unprecedented combination of high water permeance, superior sieving capability for small molecules, robust mechanical strength, chemical robustness and chlorine resistance for promising membrane&#8208;based separation science and technology.

         <title>Controlling Electroosmosis in Nanopores Without Altering the Nanopore Sensing Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanopores are powerful tools for single&#8208;molecule sensing of biomolecules and nanoparticles. The signal coming from the molecule to be analyzed strongly depends on its interaction with the narrower section&#160;of the nanopore (constriction) that may be tailored to increase sensing accuracy. Modifications of nanopore constriction have also been commonly used to induce electroosmosis, that favours the capture of molecules in the nanopore under a voltage bias and independently of their charge. However, engineering nanopores for increasing both electroosmosis and sensing accuracy is challenging. Here we&#160;show that large electroosmotic flows can be achieved without altering the nanopore constriction. Using continuum electrohydrodynamic simulations, we&#160;found that an external charged ring generates strong electroosmosis in cylindrical nanopores. Similarly, for conical nanopores we&#160;show that moving charges away from the cone tip still results in an electroosmotic flow, whose intensity reduces increasing the diameter of the nanopore section&#160;where charges are placed. We&#160;applied this paradigm to engineered biological nanopores showing, via atomistic simulations and experiments, that mutations outside the constriction induce a relatively intense electroosmosis. This strategy provides much more flexibility in nanopore design since electroosmosis can be controlled independently from the constriction, which can be optimized to improve sensing&#160;accuracy.

         <title>Triggerable Patches for Medical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Medical patches have garnered increasing attention in recent decades for several diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Advancements in material science, manufacturing technologies, and bioengineering have significantly widened their functionalities, rendering them highly versatile platforms for wearable and implantable applications. Of particular interest are triggerable patches designed for drug delivery and tissue regeneration purposes, whose action can be controlled by an external signal. Stimuli&#8208;responsive patches are particularly appealing as they may enable a high level of temporal and spatial control over the therapy, allowing high therapeutic precision and the possibility to adjust the treatment according to specific clinical and personal needs. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing extensive literature on triggerable patches, emphasizing their potential for diverse applications and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different triggering stimuli. Additionally, the current open challenges related to the design and use of efficient triggerable patches, such as tuning their mechanical and adhesive properties, ensuring an acceptable trade&#8208;off between smartness and biocompatibility, endowing them with portability and autonomy, accurately controlling their responsiveness to the triggering stimulus and maximizing their therapeutic efficacy, were reviewed.

         <title>5&#8208;Hydroxymethylfurfural and its Downstream Chemicals: A Review of Catalytic Routes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomass is crucial for sustainability, owing to its abundance and eco&#8208;friendliness. As a bio&#8208;based platform compound derived from sugar, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) enables the creation of high&#8208;value derivatives for further producing biopolymers, biofuels, and beyond. This review delves into efficient catalytic routes and economic feasibility of HMF synthesis and conversion, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.








Abstract
Biomass assumes an increasingly vital role in the realm of renewable energy and sustainable development due to its abundant availability, renewability, and minimal environmental impact. Within this context, 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), derived from sugar dehydration, stands out as a critical bio&#8208;derived product. It serves as a pivotal multifunctional platform compound, integral in synthesizing various vital chemicals, including furan&#8208;based polymers, fine chemicals, and biofuels. The high reactivity of HMF, attributed to its highly active aldehyde, hydroxyl, and furan ring, underscores the challenge of selectively regulating its conversion to obtain the desired products. This review highlights the research progress on efficient catalytic systems for HMF synthesis, oxidation, reduction, and etherification. Additionally, it outlines the techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and prospective research directions for the production of furan&#8208;based chemicals. Despite significant progress in catalysis research, and certain process routes demonstrating substantial economics, with key indicators surpassing petroleum&#8208;based products, a gap persists between fundamental research and large&#8208;scale industrialization. This is due to the lack of comprehensive engineering research on bio&#8208;based chemicals, making the commercialization process a distant goal. These findings provide valuable insights for further development of this field.

         <title>Mechanisms of the Accelerated Li+ Conduction in MOF&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanism of accelerated Li+ conduction in metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is presented in terms of polymers, MOF, MOF/polymer interface, and solid&#8208;state electrolyte/Li interfaces. In addition, the understanding of the ionic conduction mechanisms is further deepened by summarizing advanced characterisation tools, theoretical calculations, and simulations.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) for lithium metal batteries have garnered considerable interests owing to their low cost, flexibility, lightweight, and favorable interfacial compatibility with battery electrodes. Their soft mechanical nature compared to solid inorganic electrolytes give them a large advantage to be used in low pressure solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, which can avoid the cost and weight of the pressure cages. However, the application of SPEs is hindered by their relatively low ionic conductivity. In addressing this limitation, enormous efforts are devoted to the experimental investigation and theoretical calculations/simulation of new polymer classes. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown to be effective in enhancing ion transport in SPEs. However, the mechanisms in enhancing Li+ conductivity have rarely been systematically and comprehensively analyzed. Therefore, this review provides an in&#8208;depth summary of the mechanisms of MOF&#8208;enhanced Li+ transport in MOF&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (MSPEs) in terms of polymer, MOF, MOF/polymer interface, and solid electrolyte interface aspects, respectively. Moreover, the understanding of Li+ conduction mechanisms through employing advanced characterization tools, theoretical calculations, and simulations are also reviewed in this review. Finally, the main challenges in developing MSPEs are deeply analyzed and the corresponding future research directions are also proposed.

         <title>Pendant Group Functionalization of Cyclic Olefin for High Temperature and High&#8208;Density Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic pendant group functionalization of all&#8208;organic polyolefin dielectric for use in capacitive energy storage under harsh operating conditions. This work establishes the relationship between polymer structure and material, thermal, electrical properties with energy density as high as 7.1 J cc&#8722;1 at 200&#160;&#176;C. This work provides a framework for designing high temperature and high energy density polymer dielectric.









Abstract
High&#8208;temperature flexible polymer dielectrics are critical for high density energy storage and conversion. The need to simultaneously possess a high bandgap, dielectric constant and glass transition temperature forms a substantial design challenge for novel dielectric polymers. Here, by varying halogen substituents of an aromatic pendant hanging off a bicyclic mainchain polymer, a class of high&#8208;temperature olefins with adjustable thermal stability are obtained, all with uncompromised large bandgaps. Halogens substitution of the pendant groups at para or ortho position of polyoxanorborneneimides (PONB) imparts it with tunable high glass transition from 220 to 245&#160;&#176;C, while with high breakdown strength of 625&#8211;800&#160;MV/m. A high energy density of 7.1 J/cc at 200&#160;&#176;C is achieved with p&#8208;POClNB, representing the highest energy density reported among homo&#8208;polymers. Molecular dynamic simulations and ultrafast infrared spectroscopy are used to probe the free volume element distribution and chain relaxations pertinent to dielectric thermal properties. An increase in free volume element is observed with the change in the pendant group from fluorine to bromine at the para position; however, smaller free volume element is observed for the same pendant when at the ortho position due to steric hindrance. With the dielectric constant and bandgap remaining stable, properly designing the pendant groups of PONB boosts its thermal stability for high density electrification.

         <title>Chemically Programmed Hydrogels for Spatiotemporal Modulation of the Cardiac Pathological Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemically programmed responsive polymer networks, intelligent micro/nanoplatforms, and biological therapeutic cues contribute to the formation of precisely targeted, spatiotemporally controllable, and on&#8208;demand feedback microenvironment&#8208;modulated hydrogels. Chemically programmed strategies are used to construct oxygen&#8208;generating, antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, provascular, and electrointegrated hydrogels for spatiotemporal modulation of the cardiac pathological microenvironment.








Abstract
After myocardial infarction (MI), sustained ischemic events induce pathological microenvironments characterized by ischemia&#8208;hypoxia, oxidative stress, inflammatory responses, matrix remodeling, and fibrous scarring. Conventional clinical therapies lack spatially targeted and temporally responsive modulation of the infarct microenvironment, leading to limited myocardial repair. Engineered hydrogels have a chemically programmed toolbox for minimally invasive localization of the pathological microenvironment and personalized responsive modulation over different pathological periods. Chemically programmed strategies for crosslinking interactions, interfacial binding, and topological microstructures in hydrogels enable minimally invasive implantation and in situ integration tailored to the myocardium. This enhances substance exchange and signal interactions within the infarcted microenvironment. Programmed responsive polymer networks, intelligent micro/nanoplatforms, and biological therapeutic cues contribute to the formation of microenvironment&#8208;modulated hydrogels with precise targeting, spatiotemporal control, and on&#8208;demand feedback. Therefore, this review summarizes the features of the MI microenvironment and chemically programmed schemes for hydrogels to conform, integrate, and modulate the cardiac pathological microenvironment. Chemically programmed strategies for oxygen&#8208;generating, antioxidant, anti&#8208;inflammatory, provascular, and electrointegrated hydrogels to stimulate iterative and translational cardiac tissue engineering are discussed.

         <title>Design Principles of Quinone Redox Systems for Advanced Sulfide Solid&#8208;State Organic Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A designing criterion for quinone redox compounds integration into Li6PS5Cl&#8208;based solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries is developed through a combination of DFT calculations and experimental analysis. Following this criterion, 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone and 2,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone are successfully validated and effectively utilized as active electrode materials in solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries, displaying exceptional material utilization and high specific energy density.








Abstract
The emergence of solid&#8208;state battery technology presents a potential solution to the dissolution challenges of high&#8208;capacity small molecule quinone redox systems. Nonetheless, the successful integration of argyrodite&#8208;type Li6PS5Cl, the most promising solid&#8208;state electrolyte system,&#160;and quinone redox systems remains elusive due to their inherent reactivity. Here, a library of quinone derivatives is selected as model electrode materials to ascertain the critical descriptors governing the (electro)chemical compatibility and subsequently the performances of Li6PS5Cl&#8208;based solid&#8208;state organic lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Compatibility is attained if the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level of the quinone derivative is sufficiently higher than the highest occupied molecular orbital level of Li6PS5Cl. The energy difference is demonstrated to be critical in ensuring chemical compatibility during composite electrode preparation and enable high&#8208;efficiency operation of solid&#8208;state organic LMBs. Considering these findings, a general principle is proposed for the selection of quinone derivatives to be integrated with Li6PS5Cl, and two solid&#8208;state organic LMBs, based on 2,5&#8208;diamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone and 2,3,5,6&#8208;tetraamino&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone, are successfully developed and tested for the first time. Validating critical factors for the design of organic battery electrode materials is expected to pave the way for advancing the development of high&#8208;efficiency and long cycle life solid&#8208;state organic batteries based on sulfides electrolytes.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Engineered Cobalt Catalysts for Fenton&#8208;Like Reactions: Synergy of Single Atom Metal Sites and Nonmetal&#8208;Bonded Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of single&#8208;atom Co catalysts with different types of nitrogen species are synthesized to study the roles of metal&#8208; and nonmetal&#8208;bonded functionalities in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. Co&#9472;N coordination is optimal for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) adsorption to trigger electron transfer pathway, while graphitic N helps adsorb target micropollutant and acts as a secondary PMS adsorption site, synergistically promoting the degradation efficiency.








Abstract
Single atom catalysts (SACs) are atomic&#8208;level&#8208;engineered materials with high intrinsic activity. Catalytic centers of SACs are typically the transition metal (TM)&#8211;nonmetal coordination sites, while the functions of coexisting non&#8208;TM&#8208;bonded functionalities are usually overlooked in catalysis. Herein, the scalable preparation of carbon&#8208;supported cobalt&#8208;anchored SACs (CoCN) with controlled Co&#9472;N sites and free functional N species is reported. The role of metal&#8208; and nonmetal&#8208;bonded functionalities in the SACs for peroxymonosulfate (PMS)&#8208;driven Fenton&#8208;like reactions is first systematically studied, revealing their contribution to performance improvement and pathway steering. Experiments and computations demonstrate that the Co&#9472;N3C coordination plays a vital role in the formation of a surface&#8208;confined PMS* complex to trigger the electron transfer pathway and promote kinetics because of the optimized electronic state of Co centers, while the nonmetal&#8208;coordinated graphitic N sites act as preferable pollutant adsorption sites and additional PMS activation sites to accelerate electron transfer. Synergistically, CoCN exhibits ultrahigh activity in PMS activation for p&#8208;hydroxybenzoic acid oxidation, achieving complete degradation within 10&#160;min with an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 0.38&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing most reported materials. These findings offer new insights into the versatile functions of N species in SACs and inspire rational design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in complicated heterogeneous systems.

         <title>Plasmonic Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Response S&#8208;Scheme ZnO/CuInS2 Photocatalyst for H2O2 Production Coupled with Glycerin Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ZnO/CuInS2 heterojunction facilitates interfacial charge transfer, enriching carrier concentration in CuInS2. This amplifies localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and enhances near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response that are crucial for solar fuel synthesis. Through H2O2 production and glycerin oxidation, this innovation underscores the significance of NIR utilization, advancing solar energy harvesting technologies.








Abstract
Solar fuel synthesis is intriguing because solar energy is abundant and this method compensates for its intermittency. However, most photocatalysts can only absorb UV&#8208;to&#8208;visible light, while near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light remains unexploited. Surprisingly, the charge transfer between ZnO and CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) can transform a NIR&#8208;inactive ZnO into a NIR&#8208;active composite. This strong response is attributed to the increased concentration of free charge carriers in the p&#8208;type semiconductor at the interface after the charge migration between ZnO and CuInS2, enhancing the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect and the NIR response of CuInS2. As a paradigm, this ZnO/CuInS2 heterojunction is used for H2O2 production coupled with glycerin oxidation and demonstrates supreme performance, corroborating the importance of NIR response and efficient charge transfer. Mechanistic studies through contact potential difference (CPD), Hall effect test, and finite element method (FEM) calculation allow for the direct correlation between the NIR response and charge transfer. This approach bypasses the general light response issues, thereby stepping forward to the ambitious goal of harnessing the entire solar spectrum.

         <title>Highly&#8208;Polarized Solar&#8208;Blind Ultraviolet Organic Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors, with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26, are demonstrated. Stable and efficient detection of polarized light is attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of the transition dipole moment in the bc crystal plane. Finally, high&#8208;contrast polarimetric imaging and anti&#8208;interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors is crucial for their application in military remote sensing, detection, bio&#8208;inspired navigation, and machine vision. However, the significant absorption in the visible light range severely limits the application of polarization&#8208;sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors, such as high&#8208;quality anti&#8208;interference imaging. Here, based on a wide&#8208;bandgap organic semiconductor single crystal (trans&#8208;1,2&#8208;bis(5&#8208;phenyldithieno[2,3&#8208;b:3&#8242;,2&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)ethene, BPTTE), high&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet photodetectors with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26 are demonstrated. The strong anisotropy of 2D grown BPTTE single crystals in molecular vibration and optical absorption is characterized by various techniques. Under voltage modulation, stable and efficient detection of polarized light is demonstrated, attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of transition dipole moment in the bc crystal plane, rather than other factors.

     alt="Highly-Polarized Solar-Blind Ultraviolet Organic Photodetectors"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-performance polarization-sensitive solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors, with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26, are demonstrated. Stable and efficient detection of polarized light is attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of the transition dipole moment in the &lt;i&gt;bc&lt;/i&gt; crystal plane. Finally, high-contrast polarimetric imaging and anti-interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization-sensitive photodetectors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing high-performance polarization-sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors is crucial for their application in military remote sensing, detection, bio-inspired navigation, and machine vision. However, the significant absorption in the visible light range severely limits the application of polarization-sensitive ultraviolet photodetectors, such as high-quality anti-interference imaging. Here, based on a wide-bandgap organic semiconductor single crystal (trans-1,2-bis(5-phenyldithieno[2,3-b:3&#8242;,2&#8242;-d]thiophen-2-yl)ethene, BPTTE), high-performance polarization-sensitive solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors with a dichroic ratio close to 4.26 are demonstrated. The strong anisotropy of 2D grown BPTTE single crystals in molecular vibration and optical absorption is characterized by various techniques. Under voltage modulation, stable and efficient detection of polarized light is demonstrated, attributed to the intrinsic anisotropy of transition dipole moment in the &lt;i&gt;bc&lt;/i&gt; crystal plane, rather than other factors. Finally, high-contrast polarimetric imaging and anti-interference imaging are successfully demonstrated based on BPTTE single crystal photodetectors, highlighting the potential of organic semiconductors for polarization-sensitive solar-blind ultraviolet photodetectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Disordered High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Engineered by Thermal Dezincification for Improved Catalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This summarizes a novel approach (i.e. thermal diffusion scattering) to the characterization of lattice disordered high entropy alloys produced by thermal dezincification favorable for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction. This work provides a new route toward exploring and developing the catalytic activities of materials benefiting from asymmetrically disordered lattices.








Abstract
A disordered crystal structure is an asymmetrical atomic lattice resulting from the missing atoms (vacancies) or the lattice misarrangement in a solid&#8208;state material. It has been widely proven to improve the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process. In the present work, due to the special physical properties (the low evaporation temperature of below 900 &#176;C), Zn is utilized as a sacrificial component to create senary PtIrNiCoFeZn high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) with highly disordered lattices. The structure of the lattice&#8208;disordered PtIrNiCoFeZn HEA is characterized by the thermal diffusion scattering (TDS) in transmission electron microscope. Density functional theory calculations reveal that lattice disorder not only accelerates both the Volmer step and Tafel step during the HER process but also optimizes the intensity and distribution of projected density of states near the Fermi energy after the H2O and H adsorption. Anomalously high alkaline HER activity and stability are proven by experimental measurements. This work introduces a novel approach to preparing irregular lattices offering highly efficient HEA and a TDS characterization method to reveal the disordered lattice in materials. It provides a new route toward exploring and developing the catalytic activities of materials with asymmetrically disordered lattices.

         <title>Artificial Phages with Biocatalytic Spikes for Synergistically Eradicating Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Biofilms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial phages (Ir@Co3O4 (S)) with biocatalytic spikes are constructed for synergistically eradicating antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms. Benefiting from the distinctive nanospiky structures and superior biofilm microenvironment&#8208;adaptive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation capacity, the spiky Ir@Co3O4 (S) can efficiently eradicate methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilms through a synergistic &#8220;penetrate and eradicate&#8221; strategy, thus expediting wound healing without notable inflammation and toxicity.









Abstract
Antibiotic&#8208;resistant pathogens have become a global public health crisis, especially biofilm&#8208;induced refractory infections. Efficient, safe, and biofilm microenvironment (BME)&#8208;adaptive therapeutic strategies are urgently demanded to combat antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms. Here, inspired by the fascinating biological structures and functions of phages, the de novo design of a spiky Ir@Co3O4 particle is proposed to serve as an artificial phage for synergistically eradicating antibiotic&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Benefiting from the abundant nanospikes and highly active Ir sites, the synthesized artificial phage can simultaneously achieve efficient biofilm accumulation, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) penetration, and superior BME&#8208;adaptive reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, thus facilitating the in situ ROS delivery and enhancing the biofilm eradication. Moreover, metabolomics found that the artificial phage obstructs the bacterial attachment to EPS, disrupts the maintenance of the BME, and fosters the dispersion and eradication of biofilms by down&#8208;regulating the associated genes for the biosynthesis and preservation of both intra&#8208; and extracellular environments. The in vivo results demonstrate that the artificial phage can treat the biofilm&#8208;induced recalcitrant infected wounds equivalent to vancomycin. It is suggested that the design of this spiky artificial phage with synergistic &#8220;penetrate and eradicate&#8221; capability to treat antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilms offers a new pathway for bionic and nonantibiotic disinfection.

         <title>Invoking Interfacial Engineering Boosts Structural Stability Empowering Exceptional Cyclability of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The cycling stability of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 under high voltages is hindered by the occurrence of hybrid anion&#8208; and cation&#8208;redox processes, leading to oxygen escape and uncontrolled phase collapse. In this study, we propose an interfacial engineering strategy involving a straightforward mechanical ball milling and low&#8208;temperature calcination, employing a Se&#8208;doped and FeSe2&amp;Fe2O3&#8208;modified approach to design a stable Ni&#8208;rich cathode. Se2&#8722; are selectively adsorbed within oxygen vacancies to form O&#8208;TM&#8208;Se bond, effectively stabilizing lattice oxygen, and preventing structural distortion. Simultaneously, the Se&#8208;NCM811//FeSe2//Fe2O3 self&#8208;assembled electric field is activated, improving interfacial charge transfer and coupling. Furthermore, FeSe2 accelerates Li+ diffusion and reacts with oxygen to form Fe2O3 and SeO2. The Fe2O3 coating mitigates HF erosion and acts as an electrostatic shield layer, limiting the outward migration of oxygen anions. Impressively, the modified materials exhibit significantly improved electrochemical performance, with a capacity retention of 79.7% after 500 cycles at 1C under 4.5&#160;V. Furthermore, it provides an extraordinary capacity retention of 94.6% in 3 &#8211; 4.25&#160;V after 550 cycles in pouch&#8208;type full battery. This dual&#8208;modification approach demonstrates its feasibility and opens new perspectives for the development of stable lithium&#8208;ion batteries operating at high voltages.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single Metallic Atom Catalysts by a Metal Coordination Route</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Single atom catalyst (SAC) is one of the most efficient and versatile catalysts with well&#8208;defined active sites. However, facile and large&#8208;scale preparation of single&#8208;atom catalysts, the prerequisite of industrial applications, has been very challenging. This dilemma suffers from the Gibbs&#8208;Thomson effect which renders it rather difficult to achieve high single atom loading rate that mostly is below 3 mol%. Further, most of the synthesizing procedures of SAC are rather complex which result in significant mass loss and thus low yields. Herein, a novel metal coordination route is developed to address these issues simultaneously, which is realized owing to the rapid complexation between ligands (e.g., biuret) and metal ions in aqueous solutions and subsequent in&#8208;situ polymerization of the formed complexes to synthesize SACs. The whole preparation process involves only one heating step operated in air without any special protecting atmospheres, which is generally applicable for diverse transition metals. Take Cu SACs for an example, a record yield of up to 3.565&#160;kg in one pot and an ultrahigh metal loading 16.03 mol% on carbon nitride (Cu/CN) are both approached. The as&#8208;prepared Cu/CN SACs are demonstrated to possess high activity, outstanding selectivity and robust cyclicity for CO2 photoreduction to HCOOH. This research explores a robust route toward cost&#8208;effective, massive production of SACs for potential industrial applications.

Clarifying the formation mechanism of single&#8208;atom sites guides the design of emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and facilitates the identification of the active sites at atomic scale. Herein, we develop a molten&#8208;salt atomization strategy for synthesizing zinc (Zn) SACs with temperature universality from 400 to 1000/1100&#160;&#176;C and an evolved coordination from Zn&#8208;N2Cl2 to Zn&#8208;N4. The electrochemical tests and in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirm that the Zn&#8208;N4 atomic sites are active for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to carbon monoxide (CO). In a strongly acidic medium (0.2&#160;M K2SO4, pH&#176;=&#176;1), the Zn SAC formed at 1000&#160;&#176;C (Zn1NC) containing Zn&#8208;N4 sites enables highly selective CO2 electroreduction to CO, with nearly 100% selectivity toward CO product in a wide current density range of 100 to 600&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. During a 50&#8208;h continuous electrolysis at the industrial current density of 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, Zn1NC achieves Faradaic efficiencies greater than 95% for CO product. Our work presents a temperature&#8208;universal formation of single&#8208;atom sites, which provides a novel platform for unraveling the active sites in Zn SACs for CO2 electroreduction and extends the synthesis of SACs with controllable coordination sites.

         <title>3D Nanoprinting of Heterogenous Metal Oxides with High Shape Fidelity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) nanoprinting can significantly enhance the performance of sensors, batteries, optoelectronic/microelectronic devices, etc. However, current 3D nanoprinting methods for metal oxides are suffering from three key issues including limited material applicability, serious shape distortion, and the difficulty of heterogeneous integration. In this paper, we discover a mechanism in which imidazole and acrylic acid synergistically coordinate with metal ions in water. Using the mechanism, we developed a series of metal ion synergistic coordination water&#8208;soluble (MISCWS) resins for 3D nanoprinting of various metal oxides, including MnO2, Cr2O3, Co3O4, and ZnO, as well as heterogeneous structures of MnO2/NiO, Cr2O3/Al2O3, and ZnO/MgO. Besides, the synergistic coordination effect results in a 2.54&#8208;fold increase in inorganic mass fraction within the polymer, compared with previous works, which effectively mitigates the shape distortion of metal oxide microstructures. Based on this method, we also demonstrate a 3D ZnO microsensor with a high sensitivity (1.113 million at 200&#160;ppm NO2), surpassing the conventional 2D ZnO sensors by tenfold. The method yields high&#8208;fidelity 3D structures of heterogenous metal oxides with nanoscale resolution, paving the way for applications such as sensing, micro&#8208;optics, energy storage, and microsystems.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Array via Liquid Metal Nanoreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) nanostructures arranged into well&#8208;defined configurations hold great potential for accelerating the development of electronics, photonics, catalysis, and device integration. However, the random nucleation induced by the disparity in physicochemical properties of multiple elements makes it challenging to achieve single&#8208;particle synthesis at the patterned preset sites in the high&#8208;entropy scenario. Herein, we proposed the liquid metal nanoreactor strategy to realize the construction of HEA arrays. The coalescence of the liquid metal driven by the tendency to decrease surface energy provides a restricted environment for the nucleation and growth to form single HEA particles at the preset locations, which could be regarded as a self&#8208;confinement reaction. Liquid metal endowing a low diffusion barrier on the substrate and a high diffusivity of the alloy system could dynamically promote the aggregation process. As a result, the HEA array was prepared with elements up to eleven and possessed uniform periodicity, which exhibited excellent holography response in a broad spectrum. Our work injects new vitality into the construction of HEA nanopatterns and provides an excellent platform for propelling their fundamental research and applications.

         <title>Extreme Fast Charging of Lithium Metal Batteries Enabled by a Molten&#8208;Salt&#8208;Derived Nanocrystal Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The extreme fast charging performance of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with a long life is an important focus in the development of next&#8208;generation battery technologies. The friable solid electrolyte interphase and dendritic lithium growth are major problems. We report the formation of an inorganic nanocrystal&#8208;dominant interphase produced by pre&#8208;immersing the Li in molten lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide that suppresses the overgrowth of the usual interphase. Its high surface modulus combined with fast Li+ diffusivity enables a reversible dendrite&#8208;proof deposition under ultrahigh&#8208;rate conditions. It gives a record&#8208;breaking cumulative plating/stripping capacity of &gt;240,000 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2@30 mAh cm&#8722;2 for a symmetric cell and an extreme fast charging performance at 6 C for 500 cycles for a Li||LiCoO2 full cell with a high&#8208;areal&#8208;capacity, thus expanding the use of LMBs to high&#8208;loading and power&#8208;intensive scenarios. Its usability both in roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll production and in different electrolytes indicating the scalable and industrial potential of this process for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Ultrafast Photoexcitation Induced Passivation for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites exhibit great potential in photodetectors due to their exceptional optoelectronic responsivity and stability, compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the defects are detrimental to the responsivity, response speed and stability of perovskite photodetectors. Herein, we propose an ultrafast photoexcsitation induced passivation technique to synergistically reduce the dimensionality at the surface and induce oxygen doping in the bulk, via tuning the photoexcitation intensity. At the optimal photoexcitation level, the excited electrons and holes generate stretching force on the Pb&#8208;I bonds at the interlayered [PbI]6&#8211;, resulting in low dimensional perovskite formation, and the absorptive oxygen is combined with I vacancies at the same time. These two induced processes synergistically boost the carrier transport and interface contact performance. The most outstanding device exhibits a fast response speed with rise/decay time of 201&#160;ns/627&#160;ns, with a peak responsivity/detectivity of 163 mA&#183;W&#8722;1/4.52 &#215; 1010 Jones at 325&#160;nm and the enhanced cycling stability. This work suggests the possibility of a new passivation technique for high performance 2D perovskite optoelectronics.

         <title>Broadband Negative Photoconductive Response in Carbon Nanodots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Due to the broadband response and low selectivity of external light, negative photoconductivity (NPC) effect holds great potential applications in photoelectric devices. Herein, different photoresponsive carbon nanodots (CDs) are prepared from diverse precursors and the broadband response from the NPC CDs are utilized to achieve the optoelectronic logic gates and optical imaging for the first time. In detail, the mcu&#8208;CDs which are prepared by the microwave&#8208;assisted polymerization of citric acid and urea possess the large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups as sites for the adsorption of H2O molecules and thereby present a high conductivity in dark. Meanwhile, the low affinity of mcu&#8208;CDs to H2O molecules permits the light&#8208;induced desorption of H2O molecules by heat effect and thus endow the mcu&#8208;CDs with a low conductivity under illumination. The easy absorption and desorption of H2O molecules contribute to the extraordinary NPC of mcu&#8208;CDs. With the broadband NPC response in CDs, the optoelectronic logic gates and flexible optical imaging system have been established, achieving the applications of &#8220;NOR&#8221; or &#8220;NAND&#8221; logic operations and high&#8208;quality optical images. These findings unveil the unique optoelectronic properties of CDs, and have the potential to advance the applications of CDs in optoelectronic devices.

In detail, the &lt;i&gt;mcu&lt;/i&gt;-CDs which are prepared by the microwave-assisted polymerization of citric acid and urea possess the large specific surface area and abundant hydrophilic groups as sites for the adsorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules and thereby present a high conductivity in dark. Meanwhile, the low affinity of &lt;i&gt;mcu&lt;/i&gt;-CDs to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules permits the light-induced desorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules by heat effect and thus endow the &lt;i&gt;mcu&lt;/i&gt;-CDs with a low conductivity under illumination. The easy absorption and desorption of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules contribute to the extraordinary NPC of &lt;i&gt;mcu&lt;/i&gt;-CDs. With the broadband NPC response in CDs, the optoelectronic logic gates and flexible optical imaging system have been established, achieving the applications of &#8220;NOR&#8221; or &#8220;NAND&#8221; logic operations and high-quality optical images. These findings unveil the unique optoelectronic properties of CDs, and have the potential to advance the applications of CDs in optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A &#8220;liquid&#8208;in&#8208;solid&#8221; Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Anode&#8208;Free Rechargeable Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing anode&#8208;free batteries is the ultimate goal in pursuit of high energy density and safety. It is more urgent for sodium (Na)&#8208;based batteries due to its inherently low energy density and safety hazards induced by highly reactive Na metal anodes. However, there is no electrolyte that can meet the demanding Na plating&#8208;stripping Coulomb efficiency (CE) while resisting oxidative decomposition at high voltages for building stable anode&#8208;free Na batteries. Here, a &#8220;liquid&#8208;in&#8208;solid&#8221; electrolyte design strategy is proposed to integrate target performances of liquid and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Breaking through the Na+ transport channel of Na&#8208;containing zeolite molecular sieve by ion&#8208;exchange and confining aggregated liquid ether electrolytes in the nanopore and void of zeolites, it achieves excellent high&#8208;voltage stability enabled by solid&#8208;state zeolite electrolytes, while inheriting the ultra&#8208;high CE (99.84%) from liquid ether electrolytes. When applied in a 4.25&#160;V&#8208;class anode&#8208;free Na battery, an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 412&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 (based on the active material of both cathodes and anodes) can be reached, which is comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled anode&#8208;free pouch cell exhibits excellent cycling stability, and a high capacity retention of 89.2% can be preserved after 370 cycles.

&lt;p&gt;Developing anode-free batteries is the ultimate goal in pursuit of high energy density and safety. It is more urgent for sodium (Na)-based batteries due to its inherently low energy density and safety hazards induced by highly reactive Na metal anodes.

         <title>Heterostructures via a Solution&#8208;Based Anion Exchange in Microcrystalline 2D Layered Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered perovskites consist of stacks of inorganic semiconducting metal halide octahedra lattices sandwiched between organic layers with typically dielectric behavior. The in&#8208;plane confinement of electrical carriers in such two&#8208;dimensional metal halide perovskites drives a large range of appealing electronic properties, such as strong exciton binding, anisotropic charge diffusion, and directionality in polarization. Heterostructures can provide additional control on charge carrier diffusion and localization, and in&#8208;plane heterojunctions are particularly attractive because of the high charge mobility in this direction. Here, we demonstrate a versatile solution&#8208;based approach to fabricate in&#8208;plane heterostructures with different halide composition in two&#8208;dimesional lead&#8208;halide perovskite microscrystals. The exchange reaction leads to spatially separated halide phases with different band gap and light emission. The exposure of microcrystals to different halide salts in solution leads to a core&#8208;shell heterostructure architecture. Interestingly, the composition of the exchanged phase and the morphology of the phase boundary depends on the exchange route. For Br to I we observe a rugged boundary and a relatively pure exchanged crystal phase, while I to Br leads to alloyed phases in the exchanged region and a smooth interface. The different reaction mechanisms can be related to the preferred localisation of the halides at the equatorial or axial octahedra positions that either leads to dissolution and recrystallization of the octahedra lattice, or allows for ion diffusion within the lattice. These detailed insights on the ion exchange processes in layered perovskites will stimulate the development of heterostructures that can be tailored for different applications such as photocatalysis, energy storage, and light emission.

         <title>Unlocking Efficient Hydrogen Production: Nucleophilic Oxidation Reactions Coupled with Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting driven by sustainable energy is a clean and promising water&#8208;chemical fuel conversion technology for the production of high purity green hydrogen. However, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose challenges for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, limiting its efficiency and safety. Recently, the anodic OER has been replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with biomass as the substrate and coupled with hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has attracted great interest. Anode NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high&#8208;value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding high&#8208;value oxidation products or degrading pollutants. Therefore, NOR&#8208;coupled HER hydrogen production is another new green electrolytic hydrogen production strategy after electrolytic water hydrogen production, which is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy development and global decarbonization. This review explores the potential of nucleophilic oxidation reactions as an alternative to OER and delves into NOR mechanisms, guiding future research in NOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production. It assesses different NOR&#8208;coupled production methods, analyzing reaction pathways and catalyst effects. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of electrolyzers in industrialized NOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production and discusses future prospects and challenges. This comprehensive review aims to advance efficient and economical large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.

         <title>Porous Polypyrrolidines for Highly Efficient Recovery of Precious Metals Through Reductive Adsorption Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The recycling and utilization of precious metals have emerged as a critical research focus in advancing the development of the circular economy. Among numerous methods for recovering precious metals such as gold, adsorbents with both high adsorption selectivity and capacity have become key technologies. This article incorporated the N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine into a flexible porous polynorbornene backbone to create a class of distinctive porous organic polymers, named BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;14&#8764;BIT&#8208;POP&#8208;17. Through a reductive capture mechanism, the reductive adsorption sites of N&#8208;phenylpyrrolidine coordinated selectively with precious metals, the reduced metal was captured by the hierarchically porous polymers with flexible backbone. This approach led to remarkable gold recovery efficiency, achieving a record of 2321&#160;mg/g at ambient condition, and 3020&#160;mg/g under UV light, surpassing the theoretical limit. And the porous polymers were filled in a column for a continuous uptake of gold from waste PCBs, showing recovery efficiency towards gold as high as 95% after 84&#160;h. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on designing novel adsorbents for precious metal recovery, providing inspiration for researchers to explore novel adsorption modes and contribute to the advancement of the circular economy.

         <title>Calcium Hexacyanoferrate Nanozyme Enhances Plant Stress Resistance by Oxidative Stress Alleviation and Heavy Metal Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxidative damage, exacerbated by the excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), profoundly inhibits both crop growth and yield. Herein, we develop a biocompatible nanozyme, calcium hexacyanoferrate nanoparticles (CaHCF NPs), targeting ROS, to mitigate oxidative damage and facilitate sequestration of heavy metal ions during plant growth. Uniquely, CaHCF NPs feature multifaced activities to mimic six natural enzymes, involving superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase, thiol peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase, which enables them to efficiently neutralize a spectrum of reactive species, including superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals. Furthermore, CaHCF NPs promote the exchange process of calcium ions with cadmium ions, diminishing the uptake of heavy metals by plants. Importantly, at a concentration of 120&#160;&#956;g/mL, CaHCF NPs alleviate the inhibitory effects of H2O2 and cadmium chloride on the growth of Arabidopsis and tomato, increasing the activities of SOD, POD, and CAT by 46.2%, 74.4%, and 48.3%, respectively, in Arabidopsis subjected to cadmium stress for 12 days. Additionally, the level of non&#8208;enzymatic antioxidant reduced glutathione is also increased by 72.4%. Moreover, CaHCF NPs boost the expression of genes associated with antioxidation, heavy metal detoxification, nutrient transport, and stress resistance. Our findings unveil the significant potential of nanoplatforms equipped with nanozymes in alleviating oxidative stress in plant, which not only regulates crop growth but also substantially ameliorates yield and quality, heralding a new era in agricultural nanotechnology.

         <title>Enhanced Ocular Delivery of Beva via Ultra&#8208;Small Polymeric Micelles for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;VEGF Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultra&#8208;small polymeric micelles are developed for noninvasive delivery of Beva to treat oxygen&#8208;induced retinal (OIR) neovascularization model in mice. It can penetrate through the cornea and sclera&#8208;conjunctiva&#8208;choroid to reach the retina, producing the same therapeutic effect as intravitreal injection. This innovative protein nanocarrier platform offers a potential alternative to invasive intravitreal injections, improving patient experience and outcomes.








Abstract
Pathological ocular neovascularization resulting from retinal ischemia constitutes a major cause of vision loss. Current anti&#8208;VEGF therapies rely on burdensome intravitreal injections of Bevacizumab (Beva). Herein ultrasmall polymeric micelles encapsulating Beva (P@Beva) are developed for noninvasive topical delivery to posterior eye tissues. Beva is efficiently loaded into 11&#160;nm micelles fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of hyperbranched amphiphilic copolymers. The neutral, brush&#8208;like micelles demonstrate excellent drug encapsulation and colloidal stability. In vitro, P@Beva enhances intracellular delivery of Beva in ocular cells versus free drug. Ex vivo corneal and conjunctival&#8208;sclera&#8208;choroidal tissues transport after eye drops are improved 23&#8208;fold and 7.9&#8208;fold, respectively. Anti&#8208;angiogenic bioactivity is retained with P@Beva eliciting greater inhibition of endothelial tube formation and choroid sprouting over Beva alone. Remarkably, in an oxygen&#8208;induced retinopathy (OIR) model, topical P@Beva matching efficacy of intravitreal Beva injection, is the clinical standard. Comprehensive biocompatibility verifies safety. Overall, this pioneering protein delivery platform holds promise to shift paradigms from invasive intravitreal injections toward simplified, noninvasive administration of biotherapeutics targeting posterior eye diseases.

         <title>Aqueous Electrolyte With Weak Hydrogen Bonds for Four&#8208;Electron Zinc&#8211;Iodine Battery Operates in a Wide Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first four&#8208;electron zinc&#8211;iodine batteries with wide&#8208;temperature range (&#8722;40&#8201;&#160;&#176;C to 40&#160;&#8201;&#176;C) are successfully fabricated using polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) as a co&#8208;solvent in 2 m ZnCl2 aqueous solution. The hybrid electrolyte substantially reduces water activity to restrain the I+ hydrolysis, facilitating I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox kinetics, mitigating I3&#8722; formation, and smoothening Zn deposition.








Abstract
In the pursuit of high&#8208;performance energy storage systems, four&#8208;electron zinc&#8211;iodine aqueous batteries (4eZIBs) with successive I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox couples are appealing for their potential to deliver high energy density and resource abundance. However, susceptibility of positive valence I+ to hydrolysis and instability of Zn plating/stripping in conventional aqueous electrolyte pose significant challenges. In response, polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) is introduced as co&#8208;solvent in 2 m ZnCl2 aqueous solution to design a wide temperature electrolyte. Through a comprehensive investigation combining spectroscopic characterizations and theoretical simulations, it is elucidated that PEG disrupts the intrinsic strong H&#8208;bonds of water by global weak PEG&#8211;H2O interaction, which strengthens the O&#9472;H covalent bond of water and intensifies the coordination with Zn2+. This synergistic effect substantially reduces water activity to restrain the I+ hydrolysis, facilitating I&#8722;/I2/I+ redox kinetics, mitigating I3&#8722; formation and smoothening Zn deposition. The 4eZIBs in the optimized hybrid electrolyte not only deliver superior cyclability with a low fading rate of 0.0009% per cycle over 20&#160;000 cycles and a close&#8208;to&#8208;unit coulombic efficiency but also exhibit stable performance in a wide temperature range from 40&#160;&#176;C to &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This study offers valuable insights into the rational design of electrolytes for 4eZIBs.

         <title>Floating Bimetallic Catalysts for Growing 30&#160;cm&#8208;Long Carbon Nanotube Arrays with High Yields and Uniformity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating bimetallic catalysts are developed in this work to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. With optimized FeCu catalysts, 30&#8208;centimeters&#8208;long ultralong CNT arrays with a record&#8208;breaking areal density of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&#8722;1 and significantly improved uniformity can be synthesized, which can be attributed to balancing the tradeoff between catalyst fluidity and carbon solubility.








Abstract
Ultralong carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered as promising candidates for many cutting&#8208;edge applications. However, restricted by the extremely low yields of ultralong CNTs, their practical applications can hardly be realized. Therefore, new methodologies shall be developed to boost the growth efficiency of ultralong CNTs and alleviate their areal density decay at the macroscale level. Herein, a facile, universal, and controllable method for the in situ synthesis of floating bimetallic catalysts (FBCs) is proposed to grow ultralong CNT arrays with high yields and uniformity. Ferrocene and metal acetylacetonates serve as catalyst precursors, affording the successful synthesis of a series of FBCs with controllable compositions. Among these FBCs, the optimized FeCu catalyst increases the areal density of ultralong CNT arrays to a record&#8208;breaking value of &#8776;8100&#160;CNTs&#160;mm&#8722;1 and exhibits a lifetime 3.40 times longer than that of Fe, thus achieving both high yields and uniformity. A 30&#8208;centimeters&#8208;long and high&#8208;density ultralong CNT array is also successfully grown with the assistance of FeCu catalysts. As evidenced by this kinetic model and molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of Cu into Fe can simultaneously improve the catalyst fluidity and decrease carbon solubility, and an optimal catalytic performance will be achieved by balancing this tradeoff.

         <title>Mucus&#8208;Inspired Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogels: A Protective Barrier for Cells against Viral Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work reports a scalable synthetic approach to prepare mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels with tuneable rheological properties and microstructures. The synthesized hydrogels are characterized at several length scales by macrorheology, single particle tracking microrheology, cryo&#8208;scanning electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;SEM), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties and protect the underlying cells from viral infection tested in a transwell.








Abstract
Mucus is a dynamic biological hydrogel, composed primarily of the glycoprotein mucin, exhibits unique biophysical properties and forms a barrier protecting cells against a broad&#8208;spectrum of viruses. Here, this work develops a polyglycerol sulfate&#8208;based dendronized mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer (MICP&#8208;1) with &#8776;10% repeating units of activated disulfide as cross&#8208;linking sites. Cryo&#8208;electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM)&#160;analysis of MICP&#8208;1 reveals an elongated single&#8208;chain fiber morphology. MICP&#8208;1 shows potential inhibitory activity against many viruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV&#8208;1) and SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 (including variants such as Delta and Omicron). MICP&#8208;1 produces hydrogels with viscoelastic properties similar to healthy human sputum and with tuneable microstructures using linear and branched polyethylene glycol&#8208;thiol (PEG&#8208;thiol) as cross&#8208;linkers. Single particle tracking microrheology, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and cryo&#8208;scanning electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;SEM) are used to characterize the network structures. The synthesized hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;healing properties, along with viscoelastic properties that are tuneable through reduction. A transwell assay is used to investigate the hydrogel's protective properties against viral infection against HSV&#8208;1. Live&#8208;cell microscopy confirms that these hydrogels can protect underlying cells from infection by trapping the virus, due to both network morphology and anionic multivalent effects. Overall, this novel mucin&#8208;inspired copolymer generates mucus&#8208;mimetic hydrogels on a multi&#8208;gram scale. These hydrogels can be used as models for disulfide&#8208;rich airway mucus research, and as biomaterials.

         <title>Flat&#8208;Knit, Flexible, Textile Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles and operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, two textile devices are realized, a metasurface lens and a metasurface vortex&#8208;beam generator.








Abstract
Lightweight, low&#8208;cost metasurfaces and reflectarrays that are easy to stow and deploy are desirable for many terrestrial and space&#8208;based communications and sensing applications. This work demonstrates a lightweight, flexible metasurface platform based on flat&#8208;knit textiles operating in the cm&#8208;wave spectral range. By using a colorwork knitting approach called float&#8208;jacquard knitting to directly integrate an array of resonant metallic antennas into a textile, two textile reflectarray devices, a metasurface lens (metalens), and a vortex&#8208;beam generator are realized. Operating as a receiving antenna, the metalens focuses a collimated normal&#8208;incidence beam to a diffraction&#8208;limited, off&#8208;broadside focal spot. Operating as a transmitting antenna, the metalens converts the divergent emission from a horn antenna into a collimated beam with peak measured directivity, gain, and efficiency of 21.30, 15.30, and &#8722;6.00 dB (25.12%), respectively. The vortex&#8208;beam generating metasurface produces a focused vortex beam with a topological charge of m&#160;=&#160;1 over a wide frequency range of 4.1&#8211;5.8&#160;GHz. Strong specular reflection is observed for the textile reflectarrays, caused by wavy yarn floats on the backside of the float&#8208;jacquard textiles. This work demonstrates a novel approach for the scalable production of flexible metasurfaces by leveraging commercially available yarns and well&#8208;established knitting machinery and techniques.

         <title>Challenges and Advancements in the Electrochemical Utilization of Ammonia Using Solid Oxide Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid oxide fuel cells utilized with NH3 (NH3&#8722;SOFCs) have the great potential to be environmentally friendly and low carbon emission devices with high efficiency and energy density. The advancement of this technology is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of chemical or electrochemical processes occurring on anodes/catalysts. Extensive efforts have been devoted to developing efficient and durable anode/catalysts in recent decades. Although modifications to the structure, composition, and morphology of anodes or catalysts are effective, the mechanistic understandings of performance improvements or degradations remain incompletely understood. How the microscopic characteristics of anode surfaces at different scales affect the activity or durability associated with electrochemical processes is yet unclear. This paper informatively commences by summarizing existing reports on the progress of NH3&#8722;SOFCs. It subsequently outlines the influence of factors such as electrolyte/electrode types and thickness, operating temperatures, and fuel flow rates on the performance of NH3&#8722;SOFCs. The degradation mechanisms of the cells with various electrolytes and cell/system sizes are also reviewed. Lastly, the persistent challenges in designing highly efficient electrodes and catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3&#8722;SOFCs, and potential directions and future perspectives derived from SOFCs are discussed. Notably, durability, thermal cycling stability, degradation, and power density are identified as crucial indicators for enhancing low&#8208;temperature (550&#160;&#176;C or below) NH3&#8722;SOFCs. Expertise in the catalysts landscape, spanning from surface science and computational materials design to improving ammonia decomposition catalyst and reformer design, could be beneficial. This review aims to offer an updated and impartial overview of how catalysts and electrodes affect electrochemical activity and durability, offering critical insights for improving performance and mechanistic understanding, as well as establishing the scientific foundation for the discovery and design of electrodes for NH3&#8722;SOFCs or other relevant fields.

         <title>Vapor Deposition of Bilayer 3R MoS2 with Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, van der Waals (vdW) sliding ferroelectricity is confirmed in twisted 2D materials by artificially stack design. Here, controllable vapor deposition growth of bilayer 3R MoS2 is achieved. The ferroelectricity of as&#8208;grown bilayer 3R MoS2 is investigated via in situ atomic force probe technique. This work can be a big step toward industrial applications of 2D vdW ferroelectric memory.









Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional ultrathin ferroelectrics have attracted much interest due to their potential application in high&#8208;density integration of non&#8208;volatile memory devices. Recently, 2D van der Waals ferroelectric based on interlayer translation has been reported in twisted bilayer h&#8208;BN and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, sliding ferroelectricity is not well studied in non&#8208;twisted homo&#8208;bilayer TMD grown directly by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In this paper, for the first time, experimental observation of a room&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric switch in semiconducting bilayer 3R MoS2 synthesized by reverse&#8208;flow CVD is reported. Piezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) hysteretic loops and first principle calculations demonstrate that the ferroelectric nature and polarization switching processes are based on interlayer sliding. The vertical Au/3R MoS2/Pt device exhibits a switchable diode effect. Polarization modulated Schottky barrier height and polarization coupling of interfacial deep states trapping/detrapping may serve in coordination to determine switchable diode effect. The room&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity of CVD&#8208;grown MoS2 will proceed with the potential wafer&#8208;scale integration of 2D TMDs in the logic circuit.

         <title>Dynamic Cleavage&#8208;Remodeling of Covalent Organic Networks into Multidimensional Superstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of covalent organic network&#8208;based superstructures, including 0D hollow supraparticles and 2D films is shown. Based on the thermal cleavage&#8208;remodeling strategy, the reversible and controlled preparation of superstructures with multiple morphologies and species is realized and successfully demonstrates the structural excellence of the multilayered superstructures through the study of the mass transfer kinetics of iodine.








Abstract
Superstructures with complex hierarchical spatial configurations exhibit broader structural depth than single hierarchical structures and the associated broader application prospects. However, current preparation methods are greatly constrained by cumbersome steps and harsh conditions. Here, for the first time, a concise and efficient thermally responsive dynamic synthesis strategy for the preparation of multidimensional complex superstructures within soluble covalent organic networks (SCONs) with tunable morphology from 0D hollow supraparticles to 2D films is presented. Mechanism study reveals the thermally responsive dynamic &#8220;cleavage&#8208;remodeling&#8221; characteristics of SCONs, synthesized based on the unique bilayer structure of (2.2)paracyclophane, and the temperature control facilitates the process from reversible solubility to reorganization and construction of superstructures. Specifically, during the process, the oil&#8211;water&#8208;emulsion two&#8208;phase interface can be generated through droplet jetting, leading to the preparation of 0D hollow supraparticles and other bowl&#8208;like complex superstructures with high yield. Additionally, by modulating the volatility and solubility of exogenous solvents, defect&#8208;free 2D films are prepared relying on an air&#8211;liquid interface. Expanded experiments further confirm the generalizability and scalability of the proposed dynamic &#8220;cleavage&#8208;remodeling&#8221; strategy. Research on the enrichment mechanism of guest iodine highlights the superior kinetic mass transfer performance of superstructural products compared to single&#8208;hierarchical materials.

         <title>Multiphase Symbiotic Engineered Elastic Ceramic&#8208;Carbon Aerogels with Advanced Thermal Protection in Extreme Oxidative Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to obtain elastic mullite&#8208;carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels, achieving extraordinary thermomechanical stability up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments and low thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C). This innovation provides a new thermal protection material system for future space exploration.








Abstract
Elastic aerogels can dissipate aerodynamic forces and thermal stresses by reversible slipping or deforming to avoid sudden failure caused by stress concentration, making them the most promising candidates for thermal protection in aerospace applications. However, existing elastic aerogels face difficulties achieving reliable protection above 1500&#160;&#176;C in aerobic environments due to their poor thermomechanical stability and significantly increased thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. Here, a multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to synthesize mullite&#8208;carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels. The heterogeneous symbiotic effect between components simultaneously inhibits ceramic crystalline coarsening and carbon thermal etching, thus ensuring the thermal stability of the nanofiber building blocks. Efficient load transfer and high interfacial thermal resistance at crystalline&#8208;amorphous phase boundaries on the microscopic scale, coupled with mesoscale lamellar cellular and locally closed&#8208;pore structures, achieve rapid stress dissipation and thermal energy attenuation in aerogels. This robust thermal protection material system is compatible with ultralight density (30&#160;mg cm&#8211;3), reversible compression strain of 60%, extraordinary thermomechanical stability (up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments), and ultralow thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 at 300 &#176;C), offering new options and possibilities to cope with the harsh operating environments faced by space exploration.

Here, a multiphase sequence and multiscale structural engineering strategy is proposed to synthesize mullite-carbon hybrid nanofibrous aerogels. The heterogeneous symbiotic effect between components simultaneously inhibits ceramic crystalline coarsening and carbon thermal etching, thus ensuring the thermal stability of the nanofiber building blocks. Efficient load transfer and high interfacial thermal resistance at crystalline-amorphous phase boundaries on the microscopic scale, coupled with mesoscale lamellar cellular and locally closed-pore structures, achieve rapid stress dissipation and thermal energy attenuation in aerogels. This robust thermal protection material system is compatible with ultralight density (30&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;3&lt;/sup&gt;), reversible compression strain of 60%, extraordinary thermomechanical stability (up to 1600&#160;&#176;C in oxidative environments), and ultralow thermal conductivity (50.58&#160;mW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 300 &#176;C), offering new options and possibilities to cope with the harsh operating environments faced by space exploration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ceramic Meta&#8208;Aerogel with Thermal Superinsulation up to 1700&#160;&#176;C Constructed by Self&#8208;Crosslinked Nanofibrous Network via Reaction Electrospinning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymer&#8208;free reaction electrospinning strategy is proposed to prepare a ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel constructed from a cross&#8208;linked nanofiber network, whose cold surface is only 303&#160;&#176;C in a 1700&#160;&#176;C environment, laying a basis for developing advanced oxide ceramic aerogels for reliable thermal protection in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
Thermal insulation under extreme conditions requires the materials to be capable of withstanding complex thermo&#8208;mechanical stress, significant gradient temperature transition, and high&#8208;frequency thermal shock. The excellent structural and functional properties of ceramic aerogels make them attractive for thermal insulation. However, in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments (above 1500&#160;&#176;C), they typically exhibit limited insulation capacity and thermo&#8208;mechanical stability, which may lead to catastrophic accidents, and this problem is never effectively addressed. Here, a novel ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel constructed from a crosslinked nanofiber network using a reaction electrospinning strategy, which ensures excellent thermo&#8208;mechanical stability and superinsulation under extreme conditions, is designed. The ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel has an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.027&#160;W m&#8211;1 k&#8211;1, and the cold surface temperature is only 303&#160;&#176;C in a 1700&#160;&#176;C high&#8208;temperature environment. After undergoing a significant gradient temperature transition from liquid nitrogen to 1700&#160;&#176;C flame burning, the ceramic meta&#8208;aerogel can still withstand thousands of shears, flexures, compressions, and other complex forms of mechanical action without structural collapse. This work provides a new insight for developing ceramic aerogels that can be used for a long period in extremely high&#8208;temperature environments.

Abstract
The use of optoelectronic devices for high&#8208;speed and low&#8208;power data transmission and computing has been considered in the next&#8208;generation logic circuits. Heterostructures, which can generate and transmit photoresponse signals dealing with different input lights, are highly desirable for optoelectronic logic gates. Here, the printed on&#8208;chip perovskite heterostructures are demonstrated to achieve optical&#8208;controlled &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221; optoelectronic logic gates. Perovskite heterostructures are printed with a high degree of control over composition, site, and crystallization. Different regions of the printed perovskite heterostructures exhibit distinguishable photoresponse to varied wavelengths of input lights, which can be utilized to achieve optical&#8208;controlled logic functions. Correspondingly, parallel operations of the two logic gates (&#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;) by way of choosing the output electrodes under the single perovskite heterostructure. Benefiting from the uniform crystallization and strict alignment of the printed perovskite heterostructures, the integrated 3&#215;3 pixels all exhibit 100% logic operation accuracy. Finally, optical&#8208;controlled logic gates responding to multi&#8208;wavelength light can be printed on the predesigned micro&#8208;electrodes as the on&#8208;chip integrated circuits. This printing strategy allows for integrating heterostructure&#8208;based optical and electronic devices from a unit&#8208;scale device to a system&#8208;scale device.

         <title>Materials Advances in Photocatalytic Solar Hydrogen Production: Integrating Systems and Economics for a Sustainable Future</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photocatalytic solar hydrogen generation, encompassing both overall water splitting and organic reforming, presents a promising avenue for green hydrogen production. This technology holds the potential for reduced capital costs in comparison to competing methods like photovoltaic&#8208;electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis, owing to its simplicity and fewer auxiliary components. However, the current solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency of photocatalytic solar hydrogen production has predominantly remained low at around 1&#8211;2% or lower, mainly due to curtailed access to the entire solar spectrum, thus impeding practical application of photocatalytic solar hydrogen production. This review offers an integrated, multidisciplinary perspective on photocatalytic solar hydrogen production. Specifically, the review presents the existing approaches in photocatalyst and system designs aimed at significantly boosting the solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency, while also considering factors of cost and scalability of each approach. In&#8208;depth discussions extending beyond the efficacy of material and system design strategies are particularly vital to identify potential hurdles in translating photocatalysis research to large&#8208;scale applications. Ultimately, this review aims to provide understanding and perspective of feasible pathways for commercialising photocatalytic solar hydrogen production technology, considering both engineering and economic standpoints.

         <title>Surfactant Self&#8208;Assembly Enhances Tribopositivity of Stretchable Ionic Conductors for Wearable Energy Harvesting and Motion Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surfactant self&#8208;assembled stretchable solid&#8208;state water polyurethane (WPU), which avoids the negative impact of high salt dissociation, is developed. Compared to pristine WPU, the surfactant self&#8208;assembled WPU exhibits high ionic conductivity, relative permittivity, and tribopositivity. The fabricated device shows high electric output and can be efficiently employed in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Boosting stretchability and electric output is critical for high&#8208;performance wearable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG). Herein, for the first time, a new approach for tuning the composition of surface functional groups through surfactant self&#8208;assembly to improve the tribopositivity, where the assembly increases the transferred charge density and the relative permittivity of water polyurethane (WPU). Incorporating bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8722;) and alkali metal ions into a mixture of WPU and the surfactant forms a stretchable film that simultaneously functions as positive tribolayer and electrode, preventing the conventional detachment of tribolayer and electrode in long term usage. Further, the conductivity of the crosslinked film reaches 3.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 mS cm&#8722;1 while the elongation at break reaches 362%. Moreover, the surfactant self&#8208;assembly impedes the adverse impact of the fluorine&#8208;containing groups on tribopositivity. Consequently, the charge density reaches 155 &#181;C m&#8722;2, being the highest recorded for WPU and stretchable ionic conductor based TENG. This work introduces a novel approach for boosting the output charge density while avoiding the adverse effect of ionic salts in solid conductors through a universal surfactant self&#8208;assembly strategy, which can be extended to other materials. Further, the device is used to monitor and harvest the kinetic energy of human body motion.

         <title>Self&#8208;Evolving Hierarchical Hydrogel Fibers with Circadian Rhythms and Memory Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchical hydrogel fibers spontaneously form through in situ hierarchy evolution, resulting in a hierarchical structure of interface fusion. Water transport occurs in the angstrom&#8208;scale channels within the fibers by direct Coulomb knock&#8208;on, similar to Newton's cradle, which serves as a master clock controlling the multi&#8208;response behaviors of the fibers.








Abstract
The fusion of hierarchical tissues at interfaces, incorporating ultrafast selective transport channels, enables efficient matter exchange and energy transfer across multiscale structures in living organisms. However, achieving these characteristics simultaneously in an artificial multimaterial system is challenging. Here, this work presents a multimaterial hydrogel fiber with a hierarchical structure of interface fusion, which forms spontaneously through in situ hierarchy evolution induced by ionic cross&#8208;linking and molecular shear flow. Water transport occurs in the angstrom&#8208;scale confined slits created by aligned cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by direct Coulomb knock&#8208;on, resembling Newton's cradle motion. The fusion of interfaces enables high&#8208;efficiency water transport across multiscale layers, combined with Newton's cradle&#8208;like collective water motion, creating a highly sensitive negative feedback loop within the fiber. These fibers exhibit integrated behaviors of time&#8208;space perception, short&#8208;term memory and adaptive changes in shape. Additionally, they demonstrate rhythm characteristics, changing periodically in a 24&#8208;h day&#8208;night cycle. Composed of natural building blocks, these hierarchical hydrogel fibers exhibit a memristor effect similar to that of an elementary neuron, making them promising for applications in seamless on&#8208;skin and implantable bioelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;The fusion of hierarchical tissues at interfaces, incorporating ultrafast selective transport channels, enables efficient matter exchange and energy transfer across multiscale structures in living organisms. However, achieving these characteristics simultaneously in an artificial multimaterial system is challenging. Here, this work presents a multimaterial hydrogel fiber with a hierarchical structure of interface fusion, which forms spontaneously through in situ hierarchy evolution induced by ionic cross-linking and molecular shear flow. Water transport occurs in the angstrom-scale confined slits created by aligned cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) by direct Coulomb knock-on, resembling Newton's cradle motion. The fusion of interfaces enables high-efficiency water transport across multiscale layers, combined with Newton's cradle-like collective water motion, creating a highly sensitive negative feedback loop within the fiber. These fibers exhibit integrated behaviors of time-space perception, short-term memory and adaptive changes in shape. Additionally, they demonstrate rhythm characteristics, changing periodically in a 24-h day-night cycle. Composed of natural building blocks, these hierarchical hydrogel fibers exhibit a memristor effect similar to that of an elementary neuron, making them promising for applications in seamless on-skin and implantable bioelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biointerface&#8208;Engineered Hybrid Nanovesicles for Targeted Reprogramming of Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The tumor microenvironment (TME) of typical tumor types such as triple&#8208;negative breast cancer is featured by hypoxia and immunosuppression with abundant tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), which also emerge as potential therapeutic targets for antitumor therapy. M1&#8208;like macrophage&#8208;derived exosomes (M1&#8208;Exos) have emerged as a promising tumor therapeutic candidate for their tumor&#8208;targeting and macrophage&#8208;polarization capabilities. However, the limited drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability of M1&#8208;Exos have hindered their effectiveness in antitumor applications. In this study, we have developed a hybrid nanovesicle by integrating M1&#8208;Exos with AS1411 aptamer&#8208;conjugated liposomes (AApt&#8208;Lips), termed M1E/AALs. The obtained M1E/AALs are loaded with PFTBA and IR780, as P&#8208;Is, to construct P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs for reprogramming TME by alleviating tumor hypoxia and engineering TAMs. P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs&#8208;mediated tumor therapy enhances the in situ generation of reactive oxygen species, repolarizes TAMs toward an antitumor phenotype, and promotes the infiltration of T lymphocytes. The synergistic antitumor therapy based on P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival of 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. By integrating multiple treatment modalities, P&#8208;I@M1E/AALs nanoplatform demonstrates a promising therapeutic approach for overcoming hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME by targeted TAM reprogramming and enhanced tumor photodynamic immunotherapy. This study highlights an innovative TAM&#8208;engineering hybrid nanovesicle platform for the treatment of tumors characterized by hypoxic and immunosuppressive TME.

         <title>Electroactive Ionic Polymer of Intrinsic Microporosity for High&#8208;Performance Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here, we report an ionic polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM) as a high&#8208;functioning supercapacitor electrode without the need for conductive additives or binders. The performance of this material is directly related to its large accessible surface area. By comparing electrochemical performance between a porous viologen PIM and a non&#8208;porous viologen polymer, we reveal that the high energy and power density are both due to the ability of ions to rapidly access the ionic PIM. In 0.1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolyte, a pseudocapacitve energy of 315 F g&#8722;1 is observed, whereas in 0.1&#160;M Na2SO4, a capacitive energy density of 250 F g&#8722;1 is obtained. In both cases, this capacity is retained over 10,000 charge&#8208;discharge cycles, without the need for stabilizing binders or conductive additives even at moderate loadings (5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). This desirable performance is maintained in a prototype symmetric two&#8208;electrode capacitor device, which had &gt;99% Coloumbic efficiency and a &lt;10 mF capacity drop over 2000 cycles. These results demonstrate that ionic PIMs function well as standalone supercapacitor electrodes and suggest ionic PIMs may perform well in other electrochemical devices such as sensors, ion&#8208;separation membranes, or displays.

         <title>An Engineered Nanoplatform with Tropism Toward Irradiated Glioblastoma Augments Its Radioimmunotherapy Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To meet the challenges of inadequate efficacy and severe immune&#8208;related adverse events in immune checkpoint blockade therapy of glioblastomas, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines radiation&#8208;mediated tropism and radiosensitization is tailored to deliver immune checkpoint blockers with radiation&#8208;responsive release. The current study provides a promising strategy for high&#8208;efficient and low&#8208;toxic radio&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Combining radiotherapy with immune checkpoint blockade therapy offers a promising approach to treat glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), yet challenges such as limited effectiveness and immune&#8208;related adverse events (irAEs) persist. These issues are largely due to the failure in targeting immunomodulators directly to the tumor microenvironment. To address this, a biomimetic nanoplatform that combines a genetically modified mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) membrane with a bioactive nanoparticle core for chemokine&#8208;directed radioimmunotherapy of GBM is developed. The CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)&#8208;overexpressing MSC membrane acts as a tactical tentacle to achieve radiation&#8208;induced tropism toward the abundant chemokine (CC motif)&#160;ligand 2 (CCL2) in irradiated gliomas. The nanoparticle core, comprising diselenide&#8208;bridged mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) and PD&#8208;L1 antibodies (&#945;PD&#8208;L1), enables X&#8208;ray&#8208;responsive drug release and radiosensitization. In two murine models with orthotopic GBM tumors, this nanoplatform reinvigorated immunogenic cell death, and augmented the efficacy and specificity of GBM radioimmunotherapy, with reduced occurrence of irAEs. This study suggests a promising radiation&#8208;induced tropism strategy for targeted drug delivery, and presents a potent nanoplatform that enhances the efficacy and safety of radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Advances in Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics: Flexible Transparent Electrodes and Deformable Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems. This work provides an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs. The recent advances in stretchable OPVs are elaborated, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices.








Abstract
Stretchable organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted significant attention as promising power sources for wearable electronic systems owing to their superior robustness under repetitive tensile strains and their good compatibility. However, reconciling a high power&#8208;conversion efficiency and a reasonable flexibility is a tremendous challenge. In addition, the development of stretchable OPVs must be accelerated to satisfy the increasing requirements of niche markets for mechanical robustness. Stretchable OPV devices can be classified as either structurally or intrinsically stretchable. This work reviews recent advances in stretchable OPVs, including the design of mechanically robust transparent electrodes, photovoltaic materials, and devices. Initially, an overview of the characteristics and recent research progress in the areas of structurally and intrinsically stretchable OPVs is provided. Subsequently, research into flexible and stretchable transparent electrodes that directly affect the performances of stretchable OPVs is summarized and analyzed. Overall, this review aims to provide an in&#8208;depth understanding of the intrinsic properties of highly efficient and deformable active materials, while also emphasizing advanced strategies for simultaneously improving the photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility of the active layer, including material design, multi&#8208;component settings, and structural optimization.

         <title>Recent Progress of Fluorinated Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated conjugated polymers, as a thriving field for organic electronics, have received wide&#8208;spread attention. This review summarizes the fluorination strategies of building blocks in conjugated polymers and synthetic methods of fluorinated conjugated polymers. Besides, the applications of fluorinated polymer semiconductors with superior device performances, especially in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic electrochemical transistors, and thermoelectrics, are also introduced.








Abstract
In recent years, conjugated polymers have received widespread attention due to their characteristic advantages of light weight, favorable solution processability, and structural modifiability. Among various conjugated polymers, fluorinated ones have developed rapidly to achieve high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type or ambipolar polymeric semiconductors. The uniqueness of fluorinated conjugated polymers contains the high coplanarity of their structures, lower frontier molecular orbital energy levels, and strong nonbonding interactions. In this review, first the fluorinated building blocks, including fluorinated benzene and thiophene rings, fluorinated B&#8592;N bridged units, and fluoroalkyl side chains are summarized. Subsequently, different synthetic methods of fluorinated conjugated polymers are described, with a special focus on their respective advantages and disadvantages. Then, with these numerous fluorinated structures and appropriate synthetic methods bear in mind, the properties and applications of the fluorinated conjugated polymers, such as cyclopentadithiophene&#8208;, amide&#8208;, and imide&#8208;based polymers, and B&#8592;N embedded polymers, are systematically discussed. The introduction of fluorine atoms can further enhance the electron&#8208;deficiency of the backbone, influencing the charge carrier transport performance. The promising fluorinated conjugated polymers are applied widely in organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic thermoelectric devices, and other organic opto&#8208;electric devices. Finally, the outlook on the challenges and future development of fluorinated conjugated polymers is systematically discussed.

Then, with these numerous fluorinated structures and appropriate synthetic methods bear in mind, the properties and applications of the fluorinated conjugated polymers, such as cyclopentadithiophene-, amide-, and imide-based polymers, and B&#8592;N embedded polymers, are systematically discussed. The introduction of fluorine atoms can further enhance the electron-deficiency of the backbone, influencing the charge carrier transport performance. The promising fluorinated conjugated polymers are applied widely in organic field-effect transistors, organic solar cells, organic thermoelectric devices, and other organic opto-electric devices. Finally, the outlook on the challenges and future development of fluorinated conjugated polymers is systematically discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Integration Construction of Hybrid Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multidimensional construction of platinum (Pt)&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts enhances the catalytic activity and stability through the joint promotion of abundant active sites, multisite tandem catalysis, optimized oxygen adsorption, reinforced anchoring effect, and robust metal&#8208;support interaction,&#160;while considering both bulk and local mass transport to ensure long&#8208;lasting operation of the fuel cells.








Abstract
There is notable progress in the development of efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalysts, which are crucial components of fuel cells. However, these superior activities are limited by imbalanced mass transport and cannot be fully reflected in actual fuel cell applications. Herein, the design concepts and development tracks of platinum (Pt)&#8208;nanocarbon hybrid catalysts, aiming to enhance the performance of both cathodic electrocatalysts and fuel cells, are presented. This review commences with an introduction to Pt/C catalysts, highlighting the diverse architectures developed to date, with particular emphasis on heteroatom modification and microstructure construction of functionalized nanocarbons based on integrated design concepts. This discussion encompasses the structural evolution, property enhancement, and catalytic mechanisms of Pt/C&#8208;based catalysts, including rational preparation recipes, superior activity, strong stability, robust metal&#8208;support interactions, adsorption regulation, synergistic pathways, confinement strategies, ionomer optimization, mass transport permission, multidimensional construction, and reactor upgrading. Furthermore, this review explores the low&#8208;barrier or barrier&#8208;free mass exchange interfaces and channels achieved through the impressive multidimensional construction of Pt&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts, with the goal of optimizing fuel cell efficiency. In conclusion, this review outlines the challenges associated with Pt&#8208;nanocarbon integrated catalysts and provides perspectives on the future development trends of fuel cells and beyond.

         <title>Chiral Kirigami for Bend&#8208;Tolerant Reconfigurable Hologram with Continuously Variable Chirality Measures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
S: Despite the commonality of static holograms, the holography with multiple information layers and reconfigurable grey&#8208;scale images at communication frequencies remain a confluence of scientific challenges. One well&#8208;known difficulty is the simultaneous modulation of phase and amplitude of electromagnetic wavefronts with a high modulation depth. A less appreciated challenge is scrambling of the information and images with hologram bending. Here, we show that chirality&#8208;guided pixelation of plasmonic kirigami sheets enables tunable multiplexed holography at terahertz frequencies. The convex and concave structures with slanted Au strips exhibit gradual variations in geometries facilitating modulation of light ellipticity reaching 40&#160;deg. Real&#8208;time switching between three&#8208;dimensional images of the letter &#8220;M&#8221; and the Mona Lisa demonstrates the possibility of complex grey&#8208;scale information content and importance of continuously variable mirror asymmetry. Microscale chirality measures of each pixel experiences little change with bending while retaining controllable reconfigurability upon stretching, which translates to remarkable resilience of chiral holograms to bending. Simplicity of their design with local chirality measures opens the door to information technologies with fault&#8208;tolerant THz encryption, wearable holographic devices, and new communication technologies.

         <title>Li&#8208;Site Defects Induce Formation of Li&#8208;Rich Impurity Phases: Implications for Charge Distribution and Performance of LiNi0.5&#8722;xMxMn1.5O4 Cathodes (M = Fe and Mg; x = 0.05&#8211;0.2)</title>

         <dc:description>
LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4&#8212;a high&#8208;voltage cathode for lithium&#8208;ion batteries&#8212;often suffers from poor cycling stability&#8212;a challenge frequently addressed through cationic substitution. Bridging experimental testing&#160;and computational modeling, this research&#160;delves into the intricacies of Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, exploring the effects on [Mn3+], [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies, defects, and impurity phases. The correlation between Li&#8208;site defects and Li&#8208;rich impurity phases is revealed.








Abstract
An understanding of the structural properties that allow for optimal cathode performance, and their origin, is necessary for devising advanced cathode design strategies and accelerating the commercialization of next&#8208;generation cathodes. High&#8208;voltage, Fe&#8208; and Mg&#8208;substituted LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathodes offer a low&#8208;cost, cobalt&#8208;free, yet energy&#8208;dense alternative to commercial cathodes. In this work, the effect of substitution on several important structure properties is explored, including Ni/Mn ordering, charge distribution, and extrinsic defects. In the cation&#8208;disordered samples studied, a correlation is observed between increased Fe/Mg substitution, Li&#8208;site defects, and Li&#8208;rich impurity phase formation&#8212;the concentrations of which are greater for Mg&#8208;substituted samples. This is attributed to the lower formation energy of MgLi defects when compared to FeLi defects. Li&#8208;site defect&#8208;induced impurity phases consequently alter the charge distribution of the system, resulting in increased [Mn3+] with Fe/Mg substitution. In addition to impurity phases, other charge compensators are also investigated to explain the origin of Mn3+ (extrinsic defects, [Ni3+], oxygen vacancies and intrinsic off&#8208;stoichiometry), although their effects are found to be negligible.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Driven Fluorine Motion for Novel Organic Spintronic Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integrating tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect in memristors is a long&#8208;term aspiration because it allows to realize multifunctional devices, such as multi&#8208;state memory and tunable plasticity for synaptic function. However, the reported TMR in different multiferroic tunnel junctions is limited to 100%. Here, we demonstrate a giant TMR of &#8208;266% in La0.6Sr0.4MnO3(LSMO)/poly(vinylidene fluoride)(PVDF)/Co memristor with thin organic PVDF barrier. Different from the ferroelectricity&#8208;based memristors, we discover that the voltage&#8208;driven F motion in the junction generates a huge reversible resistivity change up to 106% with ns timescale. The removing F from PVDF layer suppresses the dipole field in the tunneling barrier, thereby significantly enhances the TMR. Furthermore, the TMR can be tuned by different polarizing voltage due to the strong modification of spin&#8208;polarization at the LSMO/PVDF interface upon F doping. The combining of high TMR in the organic memristor paves the way to develop high&#8208;performance multifunctional devices for storage and neuromorphic applications.

         <title>Efficient Dynamic Crosslinking for Compatibilizing Immiscible Mixed Plastics through in situ Generated Singlet Nitrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Creating a sustainable economy for plastics demands the exploration of new strategies for efficient management of mixed plastic waste. The inherent incompatibility of different plastics poses a major challenge in plastic mechanical recycling, resulting in phase&#8208;separated materials with inferior mechanical properties. Here, we present a robust and efficient dynamic crosslinking chemistry that effectively compatibilizes mixed plastics. Composed of aromatic sulfonyl azides, the dynamic crosslinker shows high thermal stability and generates singlet nitrene species in situ during solvent&#8208;free melt extrusion, effectively promoting C&#8211;H insertion across diverse plastics. This new method demonstrates successful compatibilization of binary polymer blends and model mixed plastics, enhancing mechanical performance and improving phase morphology. It holds promise for managing mixed plastic waste, supporting a more sustainable lifecycle for plastics.

         <title>Unconventional Dually&#8208;Mobile Superrepellent Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The ability of water droplets to move freely on superrepellent surfaces is a crucial feature that enables effective liquid repellency. Common superrepellent surfaces allow free motion of droplets in the Cassie state, with the liquid resting on the surface textures. However, liquid impalement into the textures generally leads to a wetting transition to the Wenzel state and droplet immobilization on the surface, thereby destroying the liquid repellency. In this study, we report the creation of a novel type of superrepellent surface through rational structural control combined with liquid&#8208;like surface chemistry, which allows for the free movement of water droplets and effective repellency in both the Cassie and Wenzel states. Theoretical guidelines for designing such surfaces are provided, and experimental results are consistent with theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the enhanced ice resistance of the dually&#8208;mobile superrepellent surfaces, along with their distinctive self&#8208;cleaning capability to eliminate internal contaminants. This study expands our understanding of superrepellency and offers new possibilities for the development of repellent surfaces with exceptional anti&#8208;wetting properties.

         <title>Precise and High&#8208;Throughput Delivery of Micronutrients in Plants Enabled by Pollen&#8208;inspired Spiny and Biodegradable Microcapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Decarbonizing food production and mitigating agriculture's environmental impact require new technologies for precise delivery of fertilizers and pesticides to plants. The cuticle, a waxy barrier that protects the surface of leaves, causes 60&#8211;90% runoff of fertilizers and pesticides, leading to the wastage of intensive resources, soil depletion, and water bodies pollution. Solutions to mitigate runoff include adding chemicals (e.g., surfactants) to decrease surface tension and enhance cuticles' permeability but have low efficacy. In this study, we use vapor&#8208;induced synergistic differentiation (VISDi) to nanomanufacture echinate pollen&#8208;like, high payload content (&#8764;50 wt%) microcapsules decorated with robust spines that mechanically disrupt the cuticle and adhere to the leaf. VISDi induces a core&#8208;shell structure in the spines, enabling the release of agrochemicals from the microparticles' body into the leaf. As proof of concept, we demonstrated precise and high throughput delivery of iron fertilizer in Fe&#8208;deficient spinach plants. Spray of spiny microparticles improved leaf adhesion by mechanical interlocking, reduced wash&#8208;off by a &#8764;12.5 fold, and enhanced chlorophyll content by &#8764;7.3 times compared to the application of spherical counterparts. Together, these results show that spiny microparticles can mitigate agricultural runoff and provide a high throughput tool for precise plant drug delivery.

         <title>Giant Iontronic Flexoelectricity in Soft Hydrogels Induced by Tunable Biomimetic Ion Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexoelectricity features the strain gradient&#8208;induced mechanoelectric conversion using materials not limited by their crystalline symmetry, but state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art flexoelectric materials exhibit very small flexoelectric coefficients and are too brittle to withstand large deformations. Here, inspired by the ion polarization in living organisms, we report the giant iontronic flexoelectricity of soft hydrogels where the ion polarization is attributed to the different transfer rates of cations and anions under bending deformations. The flexoelectricity is found to be easily regulated by the types of anion&#8208;cation pairs and polymer networks in the hydrogel. A polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel with 1&#160;M NaCl achieves a record&#8208;high flexoelectric coefficient of &#8764;1160 &#956;C/m, which can even be improved to &#8764;2340 &#956;C/m by synergizing with the effects of ion pairs and extra polycation chains. Furthermore, the hydrogel as flexoelectric materials can withstand larger bending deformations to obtain higher polarization charges owing to its intrinsic low modulus and high elasticity. A soft flexoelectric sensor is then demonstrated for object recognition by robotic hands. Our findings greatly broaden the flexoelectricity to soft, biomimetic and biocompatible materials and applications.

         <title>Immunoregulatory Engineering of Semiconducting Charge&#8208;reversal Nanoantioxidant for Ameliorating Cancer Radioimmunotheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) is a crucial clinical modality for cancer. However, non&#8208;selectivity, toxicity to normal tissues, and radio&#8208;resistance severely limit RT applications. In this study, we developed a versatile X&#8208;ray theranostic nano&#8208;antioxidant (XTN) to prevent normal tissues from oxidative damage and induce systematic and robust anticancer immunity. XTN owns NIR&#8208;II photoacoustic imaging properties for precise discrimination of the tumor margin through, thereby improving the accuracy of RT. Additionally, XTN is a nano&#8208;antioxidant to enhance the cell viability of normal cells after irradiation. Most importantly, XTN scavenges ROS in the TME to preserve the stimulatory activity of released high mobility group protein B1 to dendritic cells and recover T cells' immune function. Meanwhile, XTN achieves charge&#8208;reversal specifically releasing an immunomodulator (demethylcantharidin, DMC) in the acidic TME. Moreover, the specifically released DMC inhibits protein phosphatase&#8208;2A activity and reduces regulatory T&#8208;cell differentiation. In the bilateral 4T1 tumor model, XTN&#8208;mediated radioimmunotherapy remarkably boosts a systemic antitumor immune response and induces durable immunological memory against tumor growth.

         <title>Aerogel&#8208;involved Triple&#8208;state Gels Resemble Natural Living Leaves in Structure and Multi&#8208;functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Natural plant leaves with multiple functions, e.g., spectral features, transpiration, photosynthesis, etc., have played a significant role in the ecosystem, and artificial synthesis of plant leaves with multiple functions of natural ones is still a great challenge. Herein, we present an aerogel&#8208;involved living leaf (AL), most similar to natural ones so far, by embedding super&#8208;hydrophobic SiO2 aerogel microparticles in polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel in the presence of hygroscopic salt and chlorophyllin copper sodium to form solid&#8208;liquid&#8208;vapor triple&#8208;state gel. The AL shows a high spectral similarity with all sampled 15 species of natural leaves and exhibits &#8764;4&#8208;7 times transpiration speed higher than natural leaves. More importantly, AL can achieve several times higher photosynthesis than natural leaves without the energy provided by the respiratory action of natural ones. This work demonstrates the feasibility of creating ALs with natural leaf&#8208;like triple&#8208;state gel structures and multiple functions, opening up new avenues for energy conversion, environmental engineering, and biomimetic applications.

Yang et&#160;al. introduce a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics and can be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities.








Abstract
Biological organisms exhibit phenomenal adaptation through morphology&#8208;shifting mechanisms including self&#8208;amputation, regeneration, and collective behavior. For example, reptiles, crustaceans, and insects amputate their own appendages in response to threats. Temporary fusion between individuals enables collective behaviors, such as in ants that temporarily fuse to build bridges. The concept of morphological editing often involves the addition and subtraction of mass and can be linked to modular robotics, wherein synthetic body morphology may be revised by rearranging parts. This work describes a reversible cohesive interface made of thermoplastic elastomer that allows for strong attachment and easy detachment of distributed soft robot modules without direct human handling. The reversible joint boasts a modulus similar to materials commonly used in soft robotics, and can thus be distributed throughout soft robot bodies without introducing mechanical incongruities. To demonstrate utility, the reversible joint is implemented in two embodiments: a soft quadruped robot that self&#8208;amputates a limb when stuck, and a cluster of three soft&#8208;crawling robots that fuse to cross a land gap. This work points toward future robots capable of radical shape&#8208;shifting via changes in mass through autotomy and interfusion, as well as highlights the crucial role that interfacial stiffness change plays in autotomizable biological and artificial systems.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Enhanced UV&#8208;C LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene directly grown on a UV&#8208;C LED by plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition provides a disruptive approach for tackling the light&#8208;extraction challenge in UV&#8208;C LEDs. Graphene is used as a current spreading layer for top&#8208;emitting UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry, while it acts as a contact interlayer in UV&#8208;C LEDs in flip&#8208;chip geometry enabling a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes in the UV&#8208;C spectral range (UV&#8208;C LEDs) can potentially replace bulky and toxic mercury lamps in a wide range of applications including sterilization and water purification. Several obstacles still limit the efficiencies of UV&#8208;C LEDs. Devices in flip&#8208;chip geometry suffer from a huge difference in the work functions between the p&#8208;AlGaN and high&#8208;reflective Al mirrors, whereas the absence of UV&#8208;C transparent current spreading layers limits the development of UV&#8208;C LEDs in standard geometry. Here it is demonstrated that transfer&#8208;free graphene implemented directly onto the p&#8208;AlGaN top layer by a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach enables highly efficient 275&#160;nm UV&#8208;C LEDs in both, flip&#8208;chip and standard geometry. In flip&#8208;chip geometry, the graphene acts as a contact interlayer between the Al&#8208;mirror and the p&#8208;AlGaN enabling an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.5% and a wall&#8208;plug efficiency (WPE) of 5.5% at 8&#160;V. Graphene combined with a &#8776;1&#160;nm NiOx support layer allows a turn&#8208;on voltage &lt;5&#160;V. In standard geometry graphene acts as a current spreading layer on a length scale up to 1&#160;mm. These top&#8208;emitting devices exhibit a EQE of 2.1% at 8.7&#160;V and a WPE of 1.1%.

         <title>Engineering an Organic Nanoplatform for Augmented Pyroeletroimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance organic nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs, is rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. In vivo assessments reveal that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs and NIR laser exposure significantly inhibit the proliferation of primary and distant tumors and prominently retarded lung metastasis. This study provides a strategy for designing organic pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis and overcome the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.








Abstract
Photothermal immunotherapy has shown great promise in the treatment of tumor metastasis. However, the thermal resistance of tumor cells substantially compromises the treatment effect of photothermal immunotherapy. Herein, a high&#8208;performance organic pyroelectric nanoplatform, tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 nanoparticles (NPs), is rationally engineered for the effective pyroelectroimmunotherapy of tumor metastasis. Biocompatible tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs with excellent pyroelectric and photothermal conversion properties are constructed by assembling organic, low&#8208;bandgap pyroelectric molecules with amphiphilic polymers. After internalization by tumor cells, treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs causes an apparent temperature elevation upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, inducing potent immunogenic cell death (ICD). Additionally, the temperature variations under alternating NIR laser irradiation facilitate reactive oxygen species production for pyroelectric therapy, thus promoting ICD activation and lowering thermal resistance. Importantly, in vivo assessments illustrate that tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs in combination with NIR laser exposure notably inhibit primary and distant tumor proliferation and prominently retarded lung metastasis. RNA profiling reveals that treatment with tBu&#8208;TPAD&#8208;BF2 NPs markedly suppresses metastasis under NIR laser illumination by downregulating metastasis&#8208;related genes and upregulating immune response&#8208;associated pathways. Therefore, this study provides a strategy for designing high&#8208;performance pyroelectric nanoplatforms to effectively cure tumor metastasis, thereby overcoming the inherent shortcomings of photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Fluid Unidirectional Transport Induced by Structure and Ambient Elements across Porous Materials: From Principles to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs and ambient elements. Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8211;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators.








Abstract
Spontaneous or nonspontaneous unidirectional fluid transport across multidimension can occur under specific structural designs and ambient elements for porous materials. While existing reviews have extensively summarized unidirectional fluid transport on surfaces, there is an absence of literature summarizing fluid's unidirectional transport across porous materials. This review introduces wetting phenomena observed on natural biological surfaces or porous structures. Subsequently, it offers an overview of diverse principles and potential applications in this field, emphasizing various physical and chemical structural designs (surface energy, capillary size, topographic curvature) and ambient elements (underwater, under oil, pressure, and solar energy). Applications encompass moisture&#8208;wicking fabric, sensors, skincare, fog collection, oil&#8211;water separation, electrochemistry, liquid&#8208;based gating, and solar evaporators. Additionally, significant principles and formulas from various studies are compelled to offer readers valuable references. Simultaneously, potential advantages and challenges are critically assessed in these applications and the perspectives are presented.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;&#8220;In Situ&#8221; Analysis of the Reactive Liquid&#8208;Solid Interface during Magnesium Corrosion Using Cryo&#8208;Atom Probe Tomography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is demonstrated, which has the potential to study liquid&#8208;solid interfaces quasi&#8208;&#8220;in situ&#8221; at the near&#8208;atomic level with high chemical sensitivity using a fully cryo&#8208;enabled workflow. Using the new method&#160;in the early&#8208;stages of Mg corrosion, observed the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer with different compositions at the reactive interface under these conditions.








Abstract
The early stages of corrosion occurring at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces control the evolution of the material's degradation process, yet due to their transient state, their analysis remains a formidable challenge. Here corrosion tests are performed on a MgCa alloy, a candidate material for biodegradable implants using pure water as a model system. The corrosion reaction is suspended by plunge freezing into liquid nitrogen. The evolution of the early&#8208;stage corrosion process on the nanoscale by correlating cryo&#8208;atom probe tomography (APT) with transmission&#8208;electron microscopy (TEM) and spectroscopy, is studied. The outward growth of Mg hydroxide Mg(OH)2 and the inward growth of an intermediate corrosion layer consisting of hydrloxides of different compositions, mostly monohydroxide Mg(OH) instead of the expected MgO layer, are observed. In addition, Ca partitions to these newly formed hydroxides and oxides. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest a domain of stability for this previously experimental unreported Mg(OH) phase. This new approach and these new findings advance the understanding of the early stages of magnesium corrosion, and in general reactions and processes at liquid&#8208;solid interfaces, which can further facilitate the development of corrosion&#8208;resistant materials or better control of the biodegradation rate of future implants.

         <title>Silver Recovery from Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Solar Cells Using Continuous Stirred&#8208;Tank Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silver can be recycled from the end&#8208;of&#8208;life crystalline silicon photovoltaic, yet the recycling and its technology scale&#8208;up are still at an early stage. This work understands and optimizes the silver recovery from the solar cells in continuously stirred tank reactors from the point of view of silver recovery efficiency, through integrating experimental and numerical investigations.








Abstract
Silver can be recycled from the end&#8208;of&#8208;life crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV), yet the recycling and its technology scale&#8208;up are still at an early stage especially in continuously operations e.g., continoursely stirred tank reactors (CSTR). Here, the silver recovery from the solar cells is technically understood and optimized in the CSTR system from the point of view of silver recovery efficiency, through integrating experimental and numerical investigations. Specifically, based on the experiments, a kinetics model is developed and scanning electron microscopy surface morphology is characterized; and a computational fluid dynamics&#8211;discrete element method (CFD&#8211;DEM) particle&#8208;scale model is integrated with the kinetics model and validated against the fluid&#8208;flow pattern and silver leaching performance results from lab measurements. The validated CFD&#8211;DEM model is then applied to understand the particle&#8208;scale behavior of silver leaching in the CSTR system in terms of hydrodynamics and AgNO3 distribution under different impeller speeds. The simulation results show that the silver leaching performance is improved in an improved CSTR design with a lower impeller position and doubled impeller layers. This work reveals the effectiveness and underlying hydrodynamics of silver leaching in CSTR systems and lays a foundation for improving silver recovery in PV recycling.

Here, the silver recovery from the solar cells is technically understood and optimized in the CSTR system from the point of view of silver recovery efficiency, through integrating experimental and numerical investigations. Specifically, based on the experiments, a kinetics model is developed and scanning electron microscopy surface morphology is characterized; and a computational fluid dynamics&#8211;discrete element method (CFD&#8211;DEM) particle-scale model is integrated with the kinetics model and validated against the fluid-flow pattern and silver leaching performance results from lab measurements. The validated CFD&#8211;DEM model is then applied to understand the particle-scale behavior of silver leaching in the CSTR system in terms of hydrodynamics and AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; distribution under different impeller speeds. The simulation results show that the silver leaching performance is improved in an improved CSTR design with a lower impeller position and doubled impeller layers. This work reveals the effectiveness and underlying hydrodynamics of silver leaching in CSTR systems and lays a foundation for improving silver recovery in PV recycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coupling Antisite Defect and Lattice Tensile Stimulates Facile Isotropic Li&#8208;Ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work employs ultrafast nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock technology to controllably introduce Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. The unique multiscale coupling structure promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability. The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.








Abstract
Despite widely used as a commercial cathode, the anisotropic 1D channel hopping of lithium ions along the [010] direction in LiFePO4 prevents its application in fast charging conditions. Herein, an ultrafast nonequilibrium high&#8208;temperature shock technology is employed to controllably introduce the Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and tensile strain into the lattice of LiFePO4. This design makes the study of the effect of the strain field on the performance further extended from the theoretical calculation to the experimental perspective. The existence of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects makes it feasible for Li+ to move from the 4a site of the edge&#8208;sharing octahedra across the ab plane to 4c site of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, producing a new diffusion channel different from [010]. Meanwhile, the presence of a tensile strain field reduces the energy barrier of the new 2D diffusion path. In the combination of electrochemical experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations, the unique multiscale coupling structure of Li&#8211;Fe antisite defects and lattice strain promotes isotropic 2D interchannel Li+ hopping, leading to excellent fast charging performance and cycling stability (high&#8208;capacity retention of 84.4% after 2000 cycles at 10 C). The new mechanism of Li+ diffusion kinetics accelerated by multiscale coupling can guide the design of high&#8208;rate electrodes.

         <title>Thermal Shock Synthesis for Loading Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru Nanoclusters on Titanium Nitride as a Remarkable Electrocatalyst toward Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process, and short coalescence duration under high&#8208;temperature shock conditions give rise to Sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on TiN support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via the specific Ru&#8211;Ti interaction. The accelerated water dissociation kinetics at the Ru&#8211;Ti interfacial perimeters predominantly account for the encouraging electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction activity in alkaline.








Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts embracing metal entities on suitable supports are profound in catalyzing various chemical reactions, and substantial synthetic endeavors in metal&#8211;support interaction modulation are made to enhance catalytic performance. Here, it is reported the loading of sub&#8208;2&#160;nm Ru nanocrystals (NCs) on titanium nitride support (HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN) via a special Ru&#8211;Ti interaction using the high&#8208;temperature shock (HTS) method. Direct dechlorination of the adsorbed RuCl3, ultrafast nucleation process, and short coalescence duration at ultrahigh temperatures contribute to the immobilization of Ru NCs on TiN support via producing the Ru&#8211;Ti interfacial perimeter. HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN shows remarkable activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline solution, yielding ultralow overpotentials of 16.3 and 86.6&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The alkaline and anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers assembled using HTS&#8208;Ru&#8208;NCs/TiN yield 1.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.65 and 1.67&#160;V, respectively, which validate its applicability in the hydrogen production industry. Theoretical simulations reveal the favorable formation of Ru&#9472;O and Ti&#9472;H bonds at the interfacial perimeters between Ru NCs and TiN, which accelerates the prerequisite water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER activity. This exemplified work motivates the design of specific interfacial perimeters via the HTS strategy to improve the performance of diverse catalysis.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Metal Based Soft Humanoid Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals, with their unique and versatile properties, are revolutionizing the development of bionic soft humanoid robots. Their application in actuators, sensors, power systems, logic circuits, electrical networks, and structural frameworks paves the way for crafting soft humanoid robots that are not only more intelligent but also remarkably adaptable, heralding a new era of robotics innovation.








Abstract
The pursuit of constructing humanoid robots to replicate the anatomical structures and capabilities of human beings has been a long&#8208;standing significant undertaking and especially garnered tremendous attention in recent years. However, despite the progress made over recent decades, humanoid robots have predominantly been confined to those rigid metallic structures, which however starkly contrast with the inherent flexibility observed in biological systems. To better innovate this area, the present work systematically explores the value and potential of liquid metals and their derivatives in facilitating a crucial transition towards soft humanoid robots. Through a comprehensive interpretation of bionics, an overview of liquid metals&#8217; multifaceted roles as essential components in constructing advanced humanoid robots&#8212;functioning as soft actuators, sensors, power sources, logical devices, circuit systems, and even transformable skeletal structures&#8212;is presented. It is conceived that the integration of these components with flexible structures, facilitated by the unique properties of liquid metals, can create unexpected versatile functionalities and behaviors to better fulfill human needs. Finally, a revolution in humanoid robots is envisioned, transitioning from metallic frameworks to hybrid soft&#8208;rigid structures resembling that of biological tissues. This study is expected to provide fundamental guidance for the coming research, thereby advancing the area.

         <title>Field&#8208;Effect Thermoelectric Hotspot in Monolayer Graphene Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics in monolayer graphene transistor is reported. Spatially localized hotspot is observed at Dirac point and arises from both Joule and Peltier heating, characterized by scanning thermal microscopy and analyzed through simulation. The position of the observed Dirac hotspot can shift in the gated region, highly controllable by the gate bias.








Abstract
Graphene is a promising candidate for the thermal management of downscaled microelectronic devices owing to its exceptional electrical and thermal properties. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate electrical and thermal interconversions at a nanoscale, particularly in field&#8208;effect transistors with prevalent gate operations, remains elusive. In this study, nanothermometric imaging is used to examine a current&#8208;carrying monolayer graphene channel sandwiched between hexagonal boron nitride dielectrics. It is revealed for the first time that beyond the expected Joule heating, the thermoelectric Peltier effect actively plays a significant role in generating hotspots beneath the gated region. With gate&#8208;controlled charge redistribution and a shift in the Dirac point position, an unprecedented systematic evolution of thermoelectric hotspots, underscoring their remarkable tenability is demonstrated. This study reveals the field&#8208;effect Peltier contribution in a single graphene&#8208;material channel of transistors, offering valuable insights into field&#8208;effect thermoelectrics and future on&#8208;chip energy management.

         <title>Black Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 for Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Driven Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of new near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photocatalysts is a fascinating and challenging approach to acquire high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Herein, near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive black CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 flakes as well as CuInP2S6 flakes are designed and constructed for PHE. Atom&#8208;resolved HAADF&#8208;STEM and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure evidence the formation of ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline sheet&#8208;like structure of CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6. The synthetic CuVP2S6 and CuCrP2S6 with a narrow bandgap of around 1.0&#160;eV show the high light&#8208;absorption edge exceeding 1100&#160;nm. Moreover, through the femtosecond&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy, CuCrP2S6 displays the efficient charge transfer and long charge lifetime (18318.1&#160;ps), which is nearly 3 and 29 times longer than that of CuVP2S6 and CuInP2S6, respectively. Additionally, CuCrP2S6 with the appropriate d&#8208;band and p&#8208;band is thermodynamically favorable for the H+ adsorption and H2 desorption by contrast with CuVP2S6 and CuInP2S6. As a result, CuCrP2S6 exhibits high PHE rates of 9.12 and 0.66&#160;mmol h&#8208;1&#160;g&#8208;1 under simulated sunlight and near&#8208;infrared light irradiation, respectively, far exceeding other layered metal phospho&#8208;sulfides. This work offers a distinctive perspective for the development of new near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive photocatalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of new near-infrared-responsive photocatalysts is a fascinating and challenging approach to acquire high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) performance. Herein, near-infrared-responsive black CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; flakes as well as CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; flakes are designed and constructed for PHE. Atom-resolved HAADF-STEM and X-ray absorption fine structure evidence the formation of ultrathin single-crystalline sheet-like structure of CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The synthetic CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with a narrow bandgap of around 1.0&#160;eV show the high light-absorption edge exceeding 1100&#160;nm.

Additionally, CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; with the appropriate d-band and p-band is thermodynamically favorable for the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; desorption by contrast with CuVP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, CuCrP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits high PHE rates of 9.12 and 0.66&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; under simulated sunlight and near-infrared light irradiation, respectively, far exceeding other layered metal phospho-sulfides.

Abstract
The challenges associated with heat dissipation in high&#8208;power electronic devices used in communication, new energy, and aerospace equipment have spurred an urgent need for high&#8208;performance thermal interface materials (TIMs) to establish efficient heat transfer pathways from the heater (chip) to heat sinks. Recently, emerging 2D materials, such as graphene and boron nitride, renowned for their ultrahigh basal&#8208;plane thermal conductivity and the capacity to facilitate cross&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;morphic structural design, have found widespread use as thermal fillers in the production of high&#8208;performance TIMs. To deepen our understanding of 2D material&#8208;based TIMs, in this review, we focus primarily on graphene and boron nitride&#8208;based TIMs, exploring their structures, properties, and applications. Building on this foundation, we emphasize the developmental history of these TIMs and provide a detailed analysis of critical challenges and potential solutions. Additionally, we briefly introduce the preparation and application of some other novel 2D materials&#8208;based TIMs, aiming to offer constructive guidance for the future development of high&#8208;performance TIMs.

         <title>Stepwise Charge/Energy Transfer in MR&#8208;TADF Molecule Doped Exciplex for Ultralong Persistent Luminescence Activated with Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL), which relies on energy storage for delayed light emission by the charge separation state, has attracted intense attention in various optical applications. However, charge separation (CS) is efficient only under ultraviolet excitation in most OLPL systems because it requires a driving force from the large energy difference between the local excited (LE) and charge transfer (CT) states. In this study, we incorporate a multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecule into an exciplex system to achieve efficient OLPL in a composite material activated by visible light via a stepwise charge/energy transfer process. The enhanced absorption of the composite material facilitated a 10&#8208;fold increase in the duration of the OLPL, which can last for several hours under visible light excitation. The excited state of the MR&#8208;TADF molecule tends to charge transfer to the acceptor, followed by energy transfer to the exciplex, which benefits from the small difference between the LE and CT states owing to the inherent CS characteristics of the opposing resonance effect. Afterglow displays of these composite materials were fabricated to demonstrate their considerable potential in encryption patterns and emergency lights, which take advantage of their excellent processability, visible light activation, and tunable luminescence properties.

         <title>Superconductivity in Freestanding Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelate Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The observation of superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates has attracted significant attention due to its potential as a new platform for exploring high&#8208;Tc superconductivity. However, thus far, superconductivity has only been observed in epitaxial thin films, which limits the manipulation capabilities and modulation methods compared to two&#8208;dimensional exfoliated materials. Given the exceptionally giant strain tunability and stacking capability of freestanding membranes, separating superconducting nickelates from the as&#8208;grown substrate is a novel way to engineer the superconductivity and uncover the underlying physics. Herein, we report the synthesis of the superconducting freestanding La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 membranes (TCZero&#160;=&#160;10.6&#160;K), emphasizing the crucial roles of the interface engineering in the precursor phase film growth and the quick transfer process in achieving superconductivity. Our work offers a new versatile platform for investigating the superconductivity in nickelates, such as the pairing symmetry via constructing Josephson tunneling junctions and higher Tc values via high&#8208;pressure experiments.

         <title>Photochromic Carbon Nanomaterials: An Emerging Class of Light&#8208;Driven Hybrid Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The introduction of photochromism into nanosystems has resulted in the development of a class of light&#8208;driven functional hybrid nanomaterials. Photochromic molecules have remarkable potential in memory and optical devices, as well as in driving and manipulating molecular motors or actuators and many other systems using light. When photochromic molecules are introduced into carbon nanomaterials (CNMs), the resulting hybrids provide unique advantages and create new functions that can be employed in specific applications and devices. In this review, we highlight the recent developments in diverse photochromic CNMs. Photochromic molecules and CNMs are also introduced. The fundamentals of different photochromic CNMs are discussed, including design principles and the types of interactions between CNMs and photochromic molecules via covalent interactions and non&#8208;covalent bonding such as &#960;&#8722;&#960; stacking, amphiphilic, electrostatic, and hydrogen bonding. We then highlight the properties of photochromic CNMs, e.g., in photopatterning, fluorescence modulation, actuation, and photoinduced surface&#8208;relief gratings; and their applications in energy storage (solar thermal fuels, photothermal batteries, and supercapacitors), nanoelectronics (transistors, molecular junctions, photo&#8208;switchable conductance, and photoinduced electron transfer), sensors, and bioimaging. Finally, we present an outlook on the challenges and opportunities in the future of photochromic CNMs. This review discusses a vibrant interdisciplinary research field and is expected to stimulate further developments in nanoscience, advanced nanotechnology, intelligently responsive materials, and devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Dopamine&#8208;Based Hydrogel Microneedle Electrode for Continuous Ketone Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is triggered by production of large quantities of ketone bodies, requiring patients with T1D to constantly monitor their ketone levels. Here, we report a skin compatible hydrogel microneedle (HMN)&#8208;continuous ketone monitoring (HMN&#8208;CKM) device. The sensing mechanism relies on the catechol&#8208;quinone chemistry inherent to the dopamine (DA) molecules that are covalently linked to the polymer structure of the HMN patch. The DA serves the dual&#8208;purpose of acting as a redox mediator for measuring the byproduct of oxidation of 3&#8208;beta&#8208;hydroxybutyrate (&#946;&#8208;HB), the primary ketone bodies, while also facilitating the formation of a crosslinked HMN patch. A universal approach involving pre&#8208;oxidation and detection of the generated catechol compounds was introduced to correlate the sensor response to the &#946;&#8208;HB concentrations. We further showed that real&#8208;time tracking of a decrease in ketone levels of T1D rat model is possible using the HMN&#8208;CKM device in conjunction with a data&#8208;driven machine learning model that considers potential time delays.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a severe complication of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is triggered by production of large quantities of ketone bodies, requiring patients with T1D to constantly monitor their ketone levels. Here, we report a skin compatible hydrogel microneedle (HMN)-continuous ketone monitoring (HMN-CKM) device. The sensing mechanism relies on the catechol-quinone chemistry inherent to the dopamine (DA) molecules that are covalently linked to the polymer structure of the HMN patch. The DA serves the dual-purpose of acting as a redox mediator for measuring the byproduct of oxidation of 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (&#946;-HB), the primary ketone bodies, while also facilitating the formation of a crosslinked HMN patch. A universal approach involving pre-oxidation and detection of the generated catechol compounds was introduced to correlate the sensor response to the &#946;-HB concentrations. We further showed that real-time tracking of a decrease in ketone levels of T1D rat model is possible using the HMN-CKM device in conjunction with a data-driven machine learning model that considers potential time delays.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Toward Durable CO2 Electroreduction with Cu&#8208;Based Catalysts via Understanding Their Deactivation Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The technology of CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) provides a means to convert CO2, a waste greenhouse gas, into value&#8208;added chemicals. Copper is the most studied element that is capable of catalyzing CO2ER to obtain multi&#8208;carbon products, such as ethylene, ethanol, acetate, etc. at an appreciable rate. Under the operating condition of CO2ER, the catalytic performance of Cu decays because of several factors that alters the surface properties of Cu. In this review, these factors that cause the degradation of Cu&#8208;based CO2ER catalysts are categorized into generalized deactivation modes, that are applicable to all electrocatalytic systems. The fundamental principles of each deactivation mode and the associated effects of each on Cu&#8208;based catalysts are discussed in detail. Structure&#8208; and composition&#8208;activity relationship developed from recent in situ/operando characterization studies are presented as evidence of related deactivation modes in operation. With the aim to address these deactivation modes, catalyst design and reaction environment engineering rationales are suggested. Finally, perspectives and remarks built upon the recent advances in CO2ER are provided in attempts to improve the durability of CO2ER catalysts.

         <title>Water Transport&#8208;Induced Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation Facilitates Gelation for Controllable and Facile Fabrication of Physically Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Physically crosslinked microgels (PCMs) offer a biocompatible platform for various biomedical applications. However, current PCM fabrication methods suffer from their complexity and poor controllability, due to their reliance on altering physical conditions to initiate gelation and their dependence on specific materials. To address this issue, a novel PCM fabrication method was devised, which employs water transport&#8208;induced liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to trigger the intermolecular interaction&#8208;supported sol&#8208;gel transition within aqueous emulsion droplets. This method enables the controllable and facile generation of PCMs through a single emulsification step, allowing for the facile production of PCMs with various materials and sizes, as well as controllable structures and mechanical properties. Moreover, this PCM fabrication method holds great promise for diverse biomedical applications. The interior of the PCM not only supports the encapsulation and proliferation of bacteria but also facilitates the encapsulation of eukaryotic cells after transforming the system into an all&#8208;aqueous emulsion. Furthermore, through appropriate surface functionalization, the PCMs effectively activate T cells in vitro upon co&#8208;culturing. This work represents an advancement in PCM fabrication and offers new insights and perspectives for microgel engineering.

         <title>Phospholipid Membranes as Chemically and Functionally Tunable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellular membranes feature a couple of unique properties to control various biological functions at this interface. Protein function can be modulated by specific lipids directly or by bulk membrane properties. Using this principle, a number of advanced membrane&#8208;based applications are conceivable where the membrane acts as a modulator of biological function.








Abstract
The sheet&#8208;like lipid bilayer is the fundamental structural component of all cell membranes. Its building blocks are phospholipids and cholesterol. Their amphiphilic structure spontaneously leads to the formation of a bilayer in aqueous environment. Lipids are not just structural elements. Individual lipid species, the lipid membrane structure, and lipid dynamics influence and regulate membrane protein function. An exciting field is emerging where the membrane&#8208;associated material properties of different bilayer systems are used in designing innovative solutions for widespread applications across various fields, such as the food industry, cosmetics, nano&#8208; and biomedicine, drug storage and delivery, biotechnology, nano&#8208; and biosensors, and computing. Here, the authors summarize what is known about how lipids determine the properties and functions of biological membranes and how this has been or can be translated into innovative applications. Based on recent progress in the understanding of membrane structure, dynamics, and physical properties, a perspective is provided on how membrane&#8208;controlled regulation of protein functions can extend current applications and even offer new applications.

         <title>Mixing Insulating Commodity Polymers with Semiconducting n&#8208;type Polymers Enables High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating commodity polymers are mixed with an n&#8208;type conjugated polymer to increase the performance of organic electrochemical transistors. Blending the conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with large amounts of 10 kDa polystyrene (1:6 in monomer weight) led to an increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude and device stability by 65% with respect to the pristine conjugated polymer.








Abstract
Diluting organic semiconductors with a host insulating polymer is used to increase the electronic mobility in organic electronic devices, such as thin film transistors, while considerably reducing material costs. In contrast to organic electronics, bioelectronic devices such as the organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) rely on both electronic and ionic mobility for efficient operation, making it challenging to integrate hydrophobic polymers as the predominant blend component. This work shows that diluting the n&#8208;type conjugated polymer p(N&#8208;T) with high molecular weight polystyrene (10&#160;KDa) leads to OECTs with over three times better mobility&#8208;volumetric capacitance product (&#181;C*) with respect to the pristine p(N&#8208;T) (from 4.3 to 13.4 F V&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) while drastically decreasing the amount of conjugated polymer (six times less). This improvement in &#181;C* is due to a dramatic increase in electronic mobility by two orders of magnitude, from 0.059 to 1.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p(N&#8208;T):Polystyrene 10 KDa 1:6. Moreover, devices made with this polymer blend show better stability, retaining 77% of the initial drain current after 60 minutes operation in contrast to 12% for pristine p(N&#8208;T). These results open a new generation of low&#8208;cost organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors where the bulk of the film is made by a commodity polymer.

         <title>3D Nanostructuring of Phase&#8208;Change Materials Using Focused Ion Beam toward Versatile Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The local nanostructuring of phase&#8208;change thin films using a focused ion beam (FIB) is reported. The accurate control of FIB's milling/sputtering power for height/depth variations produces vibrant structural colors. The phase&#8208;switching of the active Sb2Se3 thin film provides additional contrast formation. The reported technique allows for the formation of super&#8208;resolution images with small pixel sizes.








Abstract
In recent&#160;years, phase&#8208;change materials have gained importance in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. Sizable optical contrast and added degree of freedom from phase switching drive the use of phase&#8208;change materials in various optical devices with outstanding results and potential for real&#8208;world applications. The local crystallization/amorphization of phase&#8208;change materials and the corresponding reflectance tuning by the crystallized/amorphized region size have potential applications, for example, for future dynamic display devices. Although the resolution is much higher than in current display devices, the pixel sizes in those devices are limited by the locally switchable structure size. Here, the spot sizes are further reduced by using ion beams instead of laser beams, dramatically increasing pixel density, demonstrating superior resolution. In addition, the power to sputter away materials can be utilized in creating nanostructures with relative height differences and local contrast. The experiment focuses on one archetypal phase&#8208;change material, Sb2Se3, prepared by pulsed&#8208;laser deposition on a reflective gold substrate. This study demonstrates that structural colors can be produced and reflectance tuning can be achieved by focused ion beam milling/sputtering of phase&#8208;change materials at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the local structuring of phase&#8208;change materials by focused ion beam can produce high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density display devices with superior resolutions.

     alt="3D Nanostructuring of Phase-Change Materials Using Focused Ion Beam toward Versatile Optoelectronics Applications"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local nanostructuring of phase-change thin films using a focused ion beam (FIB) is reported. The accurate control of FIB's milling/sputtering power for height/depth variations produces vibrant structural colors. The phase-switching of the active Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; thin film provides additional contrast formation. The reported technique allows for the formation of super-resolution images with small pixel sizes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent&#160;years, phase-change materials have gained importance in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. Sizable optical contrast and added degree of freedom from phase switching drive the use of phase-change materials in various optical devices with outstanding results and potential for real-world applications. The local crystallization/amorphization of phase-change materials and the corresponding reflectance tuning by the crystallized/amorphized region size have potential applications, for example, for future dynamic display devices. Although the resolution is much higher than in current display devices, the pixel sizes in those devices are limited by the locally switchable structure size. Here, the spot sizes are further reduced by using ion beams instead of laser beams, dramatically increasing pixel density, demonstrating superior resolution. In addition, the power to sputter away materials can be utilized in creating nanostructures with relative height differences and local contrast. The experiment focuses on one archetypal phase-change material, Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, prepared by pulsed-laser deposition on a reflective gold substrate. This study demonstrates that structural colors can be produced and reflectance tuning can be achieved by focused ion beam milling/sputtering of phase-change materials at the nanoscale. Furthermore, the local structuring of phase-change materials by focused ion beam can produce high-pixel-density display devices with superior resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering of Local Coordination Microenvironment in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts Enabling Sustainable Conversion of Biomass into a Broad Range of Amines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;atom catalyst with highly active Pd&#8208;N3&#8208;Bx sites is facilely synthesized via a supramolecular controlled pyrolysis strategy. The local coordination microenvironment between Pd and N guarantees the formation of Pd&#8208;N3 active sites, whereas the self&#8208;doping B effectively adjusts the charge distribution around Pd&#8208;N3 sites. The resulting Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits outstanding activity toward converting the lignocellulosic biomass into amines.








Abstract
Utilizing renewable biomass as a substitute for fossil resources to produce high&#8208;value chemicals with a low carbon footprint is an effective strategy for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral society. Production of chemicals via single&#8208;atom catalysis is an attractive proposition due to its remarkable selectivity and high atomic efficiency. In this work, a supramolecular&#8208;controlled pyrolysis strategy is employed to fabricate a palladium single&#8208;atom (Pd1/BNC) catalyst with B&#8208;doped Pd&#8208;Nx atomic configuration. Owing to the meticulously tailored local coordination microenvironment, the as&#8208;synthesized Pd1/BNC catalyst exhibits remarkable conversion capability for a wide range of biomass&#8208;derived aldehydes/ketones. Thorough characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the highly polar metal&#8208;N&#8208;B site, formed between the central Pd single atom and its adjacent N and B atoms, promotes hydrogen activation from the donor (reductants) and hydrogen transfer to the acceptor (C&#9552;O group), consequently leading to exceptional selectivity. This system can be further extended to directly synthesize various aromatic and furonic amines from renewable lignocellulosic biomass, with their greenhouse gas emission potentials being negative in comparison to those of fossil&#8208;fuel resource&#8208;based amines. This research presents a highly effective and sustainable methodology for constructing C&#9472;N bonds, enabling the production of a diverse array of amines from carbon&#8208;neutral biomass resources.

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistive Switching Induced by d0 Ferromagnetism of MgO in a Semiconductor Nanochannel Device with Ferromagnetic Fe/MgO Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;resistive switching with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated in a device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. The new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO.








Abstract
Exploring potential spintronic functionalities in resistive switching (RS) devices is of great interest for creating new applications, such as multifunctional resistive random&#8208;access memory and novel neuromorphic computing devices. In particular, the importance of the spin&#8208;triplet state of cation vacancies in oxide materials, which is induced by localized and strong O&#8211;2p on&#8208;site Coulomb interactions, in RS devices has been overlooked. d0 ferromagnetism sometimes appears due to the spin&#8208;triplet state and ferromagnetic Zener's double exchange interactions between cation vacancies, which are occasionally strong enough to make nonmagnetic oxides ferromagnetic. Here, for the first time, anomalous and colossal magneto&#8208;RS (CMRS) with very high magnetic field dependence is demonstrated by utilizing an unconventional RS device composed of a Ge nanochannel with all&#8208;epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline Fe/MgO electrodes. The device shows colossal and unusual behavior as the threshold voltage and ON/OFF ratio strongly depend on a magnetic field, which is controllable with an applied voltage. This new phenomenon is attributed to the formation of d0&#8208;ferromagnetic filaments by attractive Mg vacancies due to the spin&#8208;triplet states with ferromagnetic double exchange interactions and the ferromagnetic proximity effect of Fe on MgO. The findings will allow the development of energy&#8208;efficient CMRS devices with multifield susceptibility.

         <title>Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy Reveals Na Infiltration into Separator Pore Free&#8208;Volume as a Degradation Mechanism in Na Anode:Liquid Electrolyte Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cross&#8208;sectional cryo&#8208;electron microscopy of full intact Na anode electrochemical cells reveals deeper understanding of degradation mechanism during electrochemical plating and stripping with liquid electrolytes. Na is observed to infiltrate the separator by growing into the free volume space of its pores rather than mechanical puncturing by dendrites.








Abstract
Batteries utilizing a sodium (Na) metal anode with a liquid electrolyte are promising for affordable large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, a deep understanding of the intrinsic degradation mechanisms is limited by challenges in accessing the buried interfaces. Here, cryogenic electron microscopy&#160;of intact electrode:separator:electrode stacks is performed and degradation and failure of symmetric Na||Na coin cells occurs through the infiltration of Na metal through the&#160;pores of the separator rather than by mechanical puncturing by dendrites is revealed. It is shown the interior structure of the cell (electrode:separator:electrode) must be preserved and&#160;deconstructing the cell into different layers for characterization results in artifacts. In intact cell stacks, minimal liquid is found between the electrodes and separator, leading to intimate electrode:separator interfaces. After electrochemical cycling, Na infiltrates into the pore free&#8208;volume, growing through the separator to create electrical shorts and degradation. The Na infiltration occurs at interfacial regions devoid of solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), revealing SEI plays an important role in preventing Na from growing into the separator by being a physical barrier that the plated Na cannot penetrate. These results shed new light on the fundamental failure mechanisms in Na batteries and demonstrate the importance of preserving the cell structure and buried interfaces.

         <title>Silk&#8208;Fabric Reinforced Silk for Artificial Bones</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) is prepared via a hot&#8208;pressing approach with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. SFS with a perfect interface has excellent mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. SFS has great potential to replace commercial metal or ceramic implants to be used in the field of medical fracture repair.








Abstract
Bone implants for different body parts require varying mechanical properties, dimensions, and biodegradability rates. Currently, it is still challenging to produce artificial bones with perfect compatibility with human bones. In this study, a silk&#8208;fabric reinforced silk material (SFS) composed of pure silk with exceptional biocompatibility, osteogenesis, and biodegradability is reported, and demonstrates its outstanding performance as a bone implant material. The SFS is fabricated using a simple hot&#8208;pressing technique, with degummed silk fabric as the reinforcement and silk fibroin as the matrix. The SFS as a self&#8208;reinforced composite, has exceptional mechanical properties due to the almost perfect interface between the matrix and reinforcement. More importantly, its mechanical properties, biodegradability rates, and density can be tailored by adjusting the reinforcement structure and the ratio of the reinforcement to the matrix to align with the requirements for bone implantation in different parts of the human body. Besides, the SFS can improve osteoblastic proliferation and increase osteogenic activity, which is not the case with clinically used titanium alloy artificial bone. Therefore, the SFS holds significant potential to replace conventional metal or ceramic implants in the field of medical fracture repair.

         <title>Overcoming the Unfavorable Effects of &#8220;Boltzmann Tyranny:&#8221; Ultra&#8208;Low Subthreshold Swing in Organic Phototransistors via One&#8208;Transistor&#8208;One&#8208;Memristor Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the 60&#160;mV/dec limit in the subthreshold swing (SS) in conventional organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs). By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SS of 18&#160;mV/decade.








Abstract
Organic phototransistors (OPTs), as photosensitive organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), have gained significant attention due to their pivotal roles in imaging, optical communication, and night vision. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the Boltzmann distribution of charge carriers, which constrains the average subthreshold swing (SSave) to a minimum of 60&#160;mV/decade at room temperature. In this study, an innovative one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;memristor (1T1R) architecture is proposed to overcome the Boltzmann limit in conventional OFETs. By replacing the source electrode in an OFET with a memristor, the 1T1R device exploits the memristor's sharp resistance state transitions to achieve an ultra&#8208;low SSave of 18&#160;mV/decade. Consequently, the 1T1R devices demonstrate remarkable sensitivity to photo illumination, with a high specific detectivity of 3.9 &#215; 109&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2, outperforming conventional OPTs (4.9 &#215; 104&#160;cm W&#8722;1Hz1/2) by more than four orders of magnitude. The 1T1R architecture presents a potentially universal solution for overcoming the detrimental effects of &#8220;Boltzmann tyranny,&#8221; setting the stage for the development of ultra&#8208;low SSave devices in various optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Bioengineered Ionic Liquid for Catheter&#8208;Directed Tissue Ablation, Drug Delivery, and Embolization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A catheter&#8208;directed ILE is bioengineered and tested in animal models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, achieving chemical segmentectomy, improving the delivery of therapeutics, preventing infectious complications, and potentially increasing chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.








Abstract
Delivery of therapeutics to solid tumors with high bioavailability remains a challenge and is likely the main contributor to the ineffectiveness of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Here, a catheter&#8208;directed ionic liquid embolic (ILE) is bioengineered to achieve durable vascular embolization, uniform tissue ablation, and drug delivery in non&#8208;survival and survival porcine models of embolization, outperforming the clinically used embolic agents. To simulate the clinical scenario, rabbit VX2 orthotopic liver tumors are treated showing successful trans&#8208;arterial delivery of Nivolumab and effective tumor ablation. Furthermore, similar results are also observed in human ex vivo tumor tissue as well as significant susceptibility of highly resistant patient&#8208;derived bacteria is seen to ILE, suggesting that ILE can prevent abscess formation in embolized tissue. ILE represents a new class of liquid embolic agents that can treat tumors, improve the delivery of therapeutics, prevent infectious complications, and potentially increase chemo&#8208; and immunotherapy response in solid tumors.

         <title>Actuating Liquid Crystals Rapidly and Reversibly by Using Chemical Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chemical energy (fuels) and catalysis are used to drive reversible microactuation of liquid crystals and microbeads dispersed within them. Surface catalyzed reactions between H2 and O2 on Pd/Au surfaces are shown to drive rapid (occur within a second) and reversible reorientation of LCs over many cycles, resulting in reversible microactuation of beads using LC elastic forces.








Abstract
Microtubules and catalytic motor proteins underlie the microscale actuation of living materials, and they have been used in reconstituted systems to harness chemical energy to drive new states of organization of soft matter (e.g., liquid crystals (LCs)). Such materials, however, are fragile and challenging to translate to technological contexts. Rapid (sub&#8208;second) and reversible changes in the orientations of LCs at room temperature using reactions between gaseous hydrogen and oxygen that are catalyzed by Pd/Au surfaces are reported. Surface chemical analysis and computational chemistry studies confirm that dissociative adsorption of H2 on the Pd/Au films reduces preadsorbed O and generates 1 ML of adsorbed H, driving nitrile&#8208;containing LCs from a perpendicular to a planar orientation. Subsequent exposure to O2 leads to oxidation of the adsorbed H, reformation of adsorbed O on the Pd/Au surface, and a return of the LC to its initial orientation. The roles of surface composition and reaction kinetics in determining the LC dynamics are described along with a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of microactuation of beads. These results provide fresh ideas for utilizing chemical energy and catalysis to reversibly actuate functional LCs on the microscale.

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an injectable T cell&#8208;stimulating scaffold, the artificial lymph node (aLN), is developed that works with the host immune system to create an immunostimulatory niche. The aLN&#160;can activate and expand rare, antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells from fully na&#239;ve, endogenous populations. aLN stimulated cells are fully functional and synergize with immune checkpoint blockade to reduce tumor burden and prolong survival.








Abstract
T cells are critical mediators of antigen&#8208;specific immune responses and are common targets for immunotherapy. Biomaterial scaffolds have previously been used to stimulate antigen&#8208;presenting cells to elicit antigen&#8208;specific immune responses; however, structural and molecular features that directly stimulate and expand na&#239;ve, endogenous, tumor&#8208;specific T cells in vivo have not been defined. Here, an artificial lymph node (aLN) matrix is created, which consists of an extracellular matrix hydrogel conjugated with peptide&#8208;loaded&#8208;MHC complex (Signal 1), the co&#8208;stimulatory signal anti&#8208;CD28 (Signal 2), and a tethered IL&#8208;2 (Signal 3), that can bypass challenges faced by other approaches to activate T cells in situ such as vaccines. This dynamic immune&#8208;stimulating platform enables direct, in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation, as well as recruitment and coordination of host immune cells, providing an immuno&#8208;stimulatory microenvironment for antigen&#8208;specific T cell activation and expansion. Co&#8208;injecting the aLN with na&#239;ve, wild&#8208;type CD8+ T cells results in robust activation and expansion of tumor&#8208;targeted T cells that kill target cells and slow tumor growth in several distal tumor models. The aLN platform induces potent in vivo antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cell stimulation without the need for ex vivo priming or expansion and enables in situ manipulation of antigen&#8208;specific responses for immunotherapies.

This study introduces a method for 3D control of liquid crystal mesogens' orientation. A two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process sets both in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation, enabling smooth orientational patterns, and can generate stable gradient&#8208;index lenses without the need for an applied fields. The method shows promise for creating advanced photonics, re&#8208;configurable optical devices, and actuated materials.








Abstract
Liquid crystals offer a dynamic platform for developing advanced photonics and soft actuation systems due to their unique and facile tunability and reconfigurability. Achieving precise spatial patterning of the liquid crystal alignment is critical to developing electro&#8208;optical devices, programmable origami, directed colloidal assembly, and controlling active matter. Here, a simple method is demonstrated to achieve continuous 3D control of the directions of liquid crystal mesogens using a two&#8208;step photo&#8208;exposure process. In the first step, polarized light sets the orientation in the plane of confining substrates; the second step uses unpolarized light of a prescribed dose to set the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane orientation. The method enables smoothly varying orientational patterns with sub&#8208;micrometer precision. As a demonstration, the setup is used to create gradient&#8208;index lenses with parabolic refractive index profiles that remain stable without external electric fields. The lenses' focal length and sensitivity to light polarization are characterized through experimental and numerical methods. The findings pave the way for developing next&#8208;generation photonic devices and actuated materials, with potential applications in molecular self&#8208;assembly, re&#8208;configurable optics, and responsive&#160;matter.

         <title>ATP&#8208;Responsive Manganese&#8208;Based Bacterial Materials Synergistically Activate the cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG) that exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is successfully engineered. This work provides valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Stimulating the cyclic guanosine monophophate(GMP)&#8208;adenosine monophosphate (AMP) synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is a crucial strategy by which bacteria activate the tumor immune system. However, the limited stimulation capability poses significant challenges in advancing bacterial immunotherapy. Here, an adenosine 5&#8242;&#8208;triphosphate (ATP)&#8208;responsive manganese (Mn)&#8208;based bacterial material (E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG (polyethylene glycol)) is engineered successfully, which exhibits an exceptional ability to synergistically activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. In the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by elevated ATP levels, this biohybrid material degrades, resulting in the release of divalent manganese ions (Mn2+) and subsequent bacteria exposure. This combination synergistically activates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, as Mn2+ enhances the sensitivity of cGAS to the extracellular DNA (eDNA) secreted by the bacteria. The results of the in vivo experiments demonstrate that the biohybrid materials E. coli@PDMC&#8208;PEG and VNP20009@PDMC&#8208;PEG effectively inhibit the growth of subcutaneous melanoma in mice and in situ liver cancer in rabbits. Valuable insights for the development of bacteria&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are provided here.

         <title>Molecular Design for Vertical Phase Distribution Modulation in High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the effect of side&#8208;chain polarity on organic solar cells (OSCs) performance by synthesizing two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E. It shows that side&#8208;chain polarity influences component distribution within the photoactive layer, affecting excitation energy levels and charge transport. Incorporating ITIC&#8208;E significantly enhances power conversion efficiency to 19.4%, highlighting side&#8208;chain manipulation as a key strategy for OSC enhancement.








Abstract
Component distribution within the photoactive layer dictates the morphology and electronic structure and substantially influences the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, a molecular design strategy is introduced to manipulate component and energetics distribution by adjusting side&#8208;chain polarity. Two non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs), ITIC&#8208;16F and ITIC&#8208;E, are synthesized by introducing different polar functional substituents onto the side chains of ITIC. The alterations result in different distribution tendencies in the bulk heterojunction film: ITIC&#8208;16F with intensified hydrophobicity aligns predominantly with the top surface, while ITIC&#8208;E with strong hydrophilicity gravitates toward the bottom. This divergence directly impacts the vertical distribution of the excitation energy levels, thereby influencing the excitation kinetics over extended time periods and larger spatial ranges including enhanced diffusion&#8208;mediated exciton dissociation and stimulated charge carrier transport. Benefitting from the favorable energy distribution, the device incorporating ITIC&#8208;E into the PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl blend showcases an impressive power conversion efficiency of 19.4%. This work highlights side&#8208;chain polarity manipulation as a promising strategy for designing efficient NFA molecules and underscores the pivotal role of spatial energetics distribution in OSC performance.

         <title>The LiV3O8 Superlattice Cathode with Optimized Zinc Ion Insertion Chemistry for High Mass&#8208;Loading Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of zinc&#8208;ion batteries depends on resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ and enhancing mass&#8208;loading performance. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets with enlarged interlayer spacing are manufactured to provide a large&#8208;rate and stable lifetime due to optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry. Superior high mass&#8208;loading performance highlights superlattice electrode design strategy and PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 cathode application potential.








Abstract
Resolving the sluggish transport kinetics of divalent Zn2+ in the cathode lattice and improving mass&#8208;loading performance are crucial for advancing the zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) application. Herein, PEO&#8208;LiV3O8 superlattice nanosheets (PEO&#8208;LVO) with expanded interlayer spacing (1.16&#160;nm) are fabricated to provide a high&#8208;rate, stable lifetime, and large mass&#8208;loading cathode. The steady in&#8208;plane expansion without shrinkage after the first cycle, but reversible H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion in PEO&#8208;LVO are demonstrated by operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ characterizations. Moreover, the large capacity of PEO&#8208;LVO is traced back to the optimized Zn2+ insertion chemistry with increased Zn2+ storage ratio, which is facilitated by the interlayer PEO in lowering the Zn2+ diffusion barrier and increased number of active sites from additional interfaces, as anticipated by density functional theory. Due to the optimized ion insertion resulting in stalled interfacial byproducts and rapid kinetics, PEO&#8208;LVO achieves excellent high mass&#8208;loading performance (areal capacity up to 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2 for freestanding electrode with 24&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading and 2.8 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 130&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for conventional electrode with 27&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 mass&#8208;loading). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the flexible all&#8208;solid&#8208;state fiber&#8208;shaped AZIBs with high mass&#8208;loading woven into a fabric can power an electronic watch, highlighting the application potential of PEO&#8208;LVO cathode.

         <title>Engineered Surfaces That Promote Capture of Latent Proteins to Facilitate Integrin&#8208;Mediated Mechanical Activation of Growth Factors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An osteogenic platform that functions by capturing inactive growth factor molecules is engineered to overcome conventional challenges associated with the use of active growth factors. The platform triggers capture of inactive transforming growth factor beta&#8208;1 for its subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation which activates osteogenic downstream signaling in vitro and fully repairs critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.








Abstract
Conventional osteogenic platforms utilize active growth factors to repair bone defects that are extensive in size, but they can adversely affect patient health. Here, an unconventional osteogenic platform is reported that functions by promoting capture of inactive osteogenic growth factor molecules to the site of cell growth for subsequent integrin&#8208;mediated activation, using a recombinant fragment of latent transforming growth factor beta&#8208;binding protein&#8208;1 (rLTBP1). It is shown that rLTBP1 binds to the growth&#8208;factor&#8208; and integrin&#8208;binding domains of fibronectin on poly(ethyl acrylate) surfaces, which immobilizes rLTBP1 and promotes the binding of latency associated peptide (LAP), within which inactive transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1) is bound. rLTBP1 facilitates the interaction of LAP with integrin &#946;1 and the subsequent mechanically driven release of TGF&#8208;&#946;1 to stimulate canonical TGF&#8208;&#946;1 signaling, activating osteogenic marker expression in vitro and complete regeneration of a critical&#8208;sized bone defect in vivo.

&lt;p&gt;An osteogenic platform that functions by capturing inactive growth factor molecules is engineered to overcome conventional challenges associated with the use of active growth factors. The platform triggers capture of inactive transforming growth factor beta-1 for its subsequent integrin-mediated activation which activates osteogenic downstream signaling in vitro and fully repairs critical-sized bone defect in vivo.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Nanoribbons and Their Heterostructures via Assembly of Mass&#8208;Selected Inorganic Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bottom&#8208;up fabrication of materials inaccessible by conventional thermal sublimation techniques is demonstrated. Mass&#8208;selected ionic building blocks generated by electrospray ionization are soft&#8208;landed at a substrate, generating nanostructures that are subsequently examined by electron microscopy. As the first example, MoS and WS ions are used to show fabrication of micrometer&#8208;long and nanometer&#8208;wide MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene.








Abstract
Control of nanomaterial dimensions with atomic precision through synthetic methods is essential to understanding and engineering of nanomaterials. For single&#8208;layer inorganic materials, size and shape controls have been achieved by self&#8208;assembly and surface&#8208;catalyzed reactions of building blocks deposited at a surface. However, the scope of nanostructures accessible by such approach is restricted by the limited choice of building blocks that can be thermally evaporated onto surfaces, such as atoms or thermostable molecules. Herein this limitation is bypassed by using mass&#8208;selected molecular ions obtained via electrospray ionization as building blocks to synthesize nanostructures that are inaccessible by conventional evaporation methods. As the first example, micron&#8208;scale production of MoS2 and WS2 nanoribbons and their heterostructures on graphene are shown by the self&#8208;assembly of asymmetrically shaped building blocks obtained from the electrospray. It is expected that judicious use of electrospray&#8208;generated building blocks would unlock access to previously inaccessible inorganic nanostructures.

         <title>Revealing Seed&#8208;Mediated Structural Evolution of Copper&#8208;Silicide Nanostructures: Generating Structured Current Collectors for Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth mechanism behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures directly on Cu foil is elucidated, where the temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The Cu diffusion kinetics guide the morphological progression of silicides, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide nanowires proceeds through an in situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process.








Abstract
Metal silicide thin films and nanostructures typically employed in electronics have recently gained significant attention in battery technology, where they are used as active or inactive materials. However, unlike thin films, the science behind the evolution of silicide nanostructures, especially 1D nanowires (NWs), is a key missing aspect. CuxSiy nanostructures synthesized by solvent vapor growth technique are studied as a model system to gain insights into metal silicide formation. The temperature&#8208;dependent phase evolution of CuxSiy structures proceeds from Cu&gt;Cu0.83Si0.17&gt;Cu5Si&gt;Cu15Si4. The role of Cu diffusion kinetics on the morphological progression of Cu silicides is studied, revealing that the growth of 1D metal silicide NWs proceeds through an in situ formed, Cu seed&#8208;mediated, self&#8208;catalytic process. The different CuxSiy morphologies synthesized are utilized as structured current collectors for K&#8208;ion battery anodes. Sb deposited by thermal evaporation upon Cu15Si4 tripod NWs and cube architectures exhibit reversible alloying capacities of 477.3 and 477.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at a C/5 rate. Furthermore, Sb deposited Cu15Si4 tripod NWs anode tested in Li&#8208;ion and Na&#8208;ion batteries demonstrate reversible capacities of &#8776;518 and 495 mAh g&#8722;1.

         <title>Developing Hypoxia&#8208;Sensitive System via Designing Tumor&#8208;Targeted Fullerene&#8208;Based Photosensitizer for Multimodal Therapy of Deep Tumor</title>

         <dc:description>
A hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ)&#160;is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds, which can target tumors and achieve specific drug release in tumors. The powerful nanotherapy system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy possesses satisfactory oncolytic efficacy for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for clinic. However, powerless efficiency for deep hypoxic tumor therapy remains an enormous challenge for PDT. Herein, a hypoxia&#8208;sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD&#8208;SRGD) based on fullerene (C70) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) is rationally designed for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors. To enhance the accumulation and achieve specific drug release in tumor, the FTCD&#8208;SRGD is modified with cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds. With the exacerbated hypoxic microenvironment created by C70 consuming O2 for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), TPZ is activated to produce toxic radical species to ablate deep tumors, which achieves a synergistic treatment of C70&#8208;mediated PDT and hypoxia&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy. Additionally, given this hypoxia&#8208;sensitive system&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) activating anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte to result in more susceptible tumor to immunotherapy, FTCD&#8208;SRGD plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1) fully inhibit deep hypoxic tumors by promoting infiltration of effector T cells in tumors. Collectively, it is the first time to develop a multimodal therapy system with fullerene&#8208;based hypoxia&#8208;sensitive PS for deep tumors. The powerful multimodal nanotherapeutic system for combining hypoxia&#8208;enhanced PDT and immunotherapy to massacre deep hypoxic tumors can provide a paradigm to combat the present bottleneck of tumor therapy.

         <title>Synergistic Interaction between Metal Single&#8208;Atoms and Defective WO3&#8722;x Nanosheets for Enhanced Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The generation of a strong synergistic effect between metal single&#8208;atoms and oxygen vacancies of WO3&#8722;x nanosheets can effectively boost the sonodyanimc therapy performance under ultrasound irradiation, thus realizing highly efficient cancer treatment.








Abstract
Although metal single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based nanomaterials are explored as sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), they normally exhibit poor activities and need to combine with other therapeutic strategies. Herein, the deposition of metal SAs on oxygen vacancy (OV)&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to generate a synergistic effect for efficient SDT is reported. Crystalline WO3 and OV&#8208;rich WO3&#8722;x nanosheets are first prepared by simple calcination of the WO3&#183;H2O nanosheets under an air and N2 atmosphere, respectively. Pt, Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni metal SAs are then deposited on WO3&#8722;x nanosheets to obtain metal SA&#8208;decorated WO3&#8722;x nanocomposites (M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x). Importantly, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x sonosensitizer exhibits a much higher activity for ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced production of reactive oxygen species than that of the WO3&#8722;x and Cu SA&#8208;decorated WO3, which is also higher than other M&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that the excellent SDT performance of the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x nanosheets should be attributed to the synergistic effect between Cu SAs and WO3&#8722;x OVs. Therefore, after polyethylene glycol modification, the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x can quickly kill cancer cells in vitro and effectively eradicate tumors in vivo under US irradiation. Transcriptome sequencing analysis and further molecular validation suggest that the Cu&#8208;WO3&#8722;x&#8208;mediated SDT&#8208;activated apoptosis and TNF signaling pathways are potential drivers of tumor apoptosis induction.

&lt;p&gt;The generation of a strong synergistic effect between metal single-atoms and oxygen vacancies of WO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; nanosheets can effectively boost the sonodyanimc therapy performance under ultrasound irradiation, thus realizing highly efficient cancer treatment.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although metal single-atom (SA)-based nanomaterials are explored as sonosensitizers for sonodynamic therapy (SDT), they normally exhibit poor activities and need to combine with other therapeutic strategies. Herein, the deposition of metal SAs on oxygen vacancy (OV)-rich WO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; and Cu SA-decorated WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is also higher than other M-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Ptychographic Nanoscale Imaging of the Magnetoelectric Coupling in Freestanding BiFeO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferroelectric and magnetic structure of a freestanding thin film of multiferroic bismuth ferrite are imaged with soft x&#8208;ray ptychography at the Fe L&#8208;edge. This scanning coherent diffractive imaging technique directly visualizes the strong magnetoelectric coupling between the antiferromagnetic spin cycloid and ferroelectric domains on the nanoscale.








Abstract
Understanding the magnetic and ferroelectric ordering of magnetoelectric multiferroic materials at the nanoscale necessitates a versatile imaging method with high spatial resolution. Here, soft X&#8208;ray ptychography is employed to simultaneously image the ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic domains in an 80&#160;nm thin freestanding film of the room&#8208;temperature multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO). The antiferromagnetic spin cycloid of period 64&#160;nm is resolved by reconstructing the corresponding resonant elastic X&#8208;ray scattering in real space and visualized together with mosaic&#8208;like ferroelectric domains in a linear dichroic contrast image at the Fe L3 edge. The measurements reveal a near perfect coupling between the antiferromagnetic and ferroelectric ordering by which the propagation direction of the spin cycloid is locked orthogonally to the ferroelectric polarization. In addition, the study evinces both a preference for in&#8208;plane propagation of the spin cycloid and changes of the ferroelectric polarization by 71&#176;&#160;between multiferroic domains in the epitaxial strain&#8208;free, freestanding BFO film. The results provide a direct visualization of the strong magnetoelectric coupling in BFO and of its fine multiferroic domain structure, emphasizing the potential of ptychographic imaging for the study of multiferroics and non&#8208;collinear magnetic materials with soft&#160;X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Octadecyl Gallate and Lipid&#8208;Modified MnSe2 Nanoparticles Enhance Radiosensitivity in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Promote Radioprotection in Normal Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is discovered that cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by using transcriptome data. Therefore, MnSe2&#8208;lipid with uniform sphere morphology and pH&#8208;responsive property is designed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosenstivity and Se element reduces side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Radiotherapy, a widely used therapeutic strategy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), is always limited by radioresistance of tumor tissues and side&#8208;effects on normal tissues. Herein, a signature based on four core genes of cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, is developed to predict prognosis and assess immune cell infiltration, indicating that the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and radiotherapy efficacy are closely intertwined in ESCC. A novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness is developed to simultaneously overcome radioresistance and reduce side&#8208;effects of radiation. The uniform MnSe2 encapsulated lipid effectively achieves tumor accumulation. Octadecyl gallate on surface of MnSe2 forming pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;phenolic covalent realizes rapid degradation in TME. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response by promoting secretion of cytokines and increasing white blood cells, and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy. Overall, this multifunctional remedy which is responsive to TME is capable of providing radiosensitivity by cGAS&#8208;STING pathway&#8208;mediated immunostimulation and chemodynamic therapy, and radioprotection of normal tissues, is highlighted here to optimize ESCC treatment.

         <title>Supramolecular Lipid Nanoparticles Based on Host&#8211;Guest Recognition: A New Generation Delivery System of mRNA Vaccines For Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) are developed to codeliver mRNA and an adjuvant (R848) through host&#8722;guest recognition, showing brilliant potentials in cancer immunotherapy. SMLNP@mRNAOVA/R848 significantly increases the translation efficiency, stimulates DC maturation, and promotes antigen presentation, thus eliciting potent antitumor immune responses. Excitingly, the antitumor performances of mRNA vaccine are further potentiated by synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Dendritic cell (DC) maturation is a crucial process for antigen presentation and the initiation of T cell&#8208;mediated immune responses. Toll&#8208;like receptors play pivotal roles in stimulating DC maturation and promoting antigen presentation. Here, a novel message RNA (mRNA) cancer vaccine is reported that boosts antitumor efficacy by codelivering an mRNA encoding tumor antigen and a TLR7/8 agonist (R848) to DC using supramolecular lipid nanoparticles (SMLNP) as a delivery platform, in which a new ionizable lipid (N2&#8208;3L) remarkably enhances the translation efficiency of mRNA and a &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD)&#8208;modified ionizable lipid (Lip&#8208;CD) encapsulates R848. The incorporation of R848 adjuvant into the mRNA vaccine through noncovalent host&#8211;guest complexation significantly promotes DC maturation and antigen presentation after vaccination, thus resulting in superior antitumor efficacy in vivo. Moreover, the antitumor efficacy is further boosted synergized with immune checkpoint blockade by potentiating the anticancer capability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes infiltrated in tumor sites. This work indicates that SMLNP shows brilliant potential as next&#8208;generation delivery system in the development of mRNA vaccines with high efficacy.

         <title>Designing Ultratough Single&#8208;Network Hydrogels with Centimeter&#8208;Scale Fractocohesive Lengths via Inelastic Crack Blunting</title>

Fractocohesive length measures the flaw sensitivity of materials. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant the material is. Synthetic soft materials have short fractocohesive lengths, often around 1 mm. Highly flaw&#8208;insensitive single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous network of distributed chain lengths are designed, demonstrating a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels.








Abstract
Fractocohesive length, defined as the ratio of fracture toughness to work of fracture, measures the sensitivity of materials to fracture in the presence of flaws. The larger the fractocohesive length, the more flaw&#8208;tolerant and crack&#8208;resistant the hydrogel. For synthetic soft materials, the fractocohesive length is short, often on the scale of 1&#8197;mm. Here, highly flaw&#8208;insensitive (HFI) single&#8208;network hydrogels containing an entangled inhomogeneous polymer network of widely distributed chain lengths are designed. The HFI hydrogels demonstrate a centimeter&#8208;scale fractocohesive length of 2.21&#160;cm, which is the highest ever recorded for synthetic hydrogels, and an unprecedented fracture toughness of &#8776;13&#160;300 J m&#8722;2. The uncommon flaw insensitivity results from the inelastic crack blunting inherent to the highly inhomogeneous network. When the HFI hydrogel is stretched, a large number of short chains break while coiled long chains can disentangle, unwind, and straighten, producing large inelastic deformation that substantially blunts the crack tip in a plastic manner, thereby deconcentrating crack&#8208;tip stresses and blocking crack extension. The flaw&#8208;insensitive design strategy is applicable to various hydrogels such as polyacrylamide and poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels and enables the development of HFI soft composites.

         <title>Defect Passivation Refinement in Perovskite Photovoltaics: Achieving Efficiency over 45% under Low&#8208;Light and Low&#8208;Temperature Dual Extreme Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. The shift of molecular bonding upon cooling down the film leads to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability is obtained.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have emerged as the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;to&#8208;electricity technology. However, their practical application still suffers from energy loss induced by intrinsic defects within the perovskite lattice. Here, a refined defect passivation in perovskite films is designed, which shows a multi&#8208;interaction mechanism between the perovskite and passivator. Interestingly, a shift of molecular bonding is observed upon cooling down the film, leading to a stronger passivation of iodine/formamidine vacancies. Such mechanism on device under low&#8208;light and low&#8208;temperature conditions is further leveraged and a record efficiency over 45% with durable ambient stability (T90 &gt; 4000&#160;h) is obtained. The pioneer application of perovskite solar cells in above dual extreme conditions in this work reveals the key principles of designing functional groups for the passivators, and also demonstrates the capability of perovskites for diverse terrestrial energy conversion applications in demanding environments such as polar regions and outer space.

         <title>Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Peptide Prodrug with Targeting, Assembly and Release Properties for Overcoming Bacterium&#8208;Induced Drug Resistance and Potentiating Anti&#8208;Cancer Immune Response</title>

A feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs is proposed to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment. Under the catalysis of carboxylesterase, Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic ciprofloxacin derivative and chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy.








Abstract
The presence of bacteria in tumor results in chemotherapeutic drug resistance and weakens the immune response in colorectal cancer. To overcome bacterium&#8208;induced chemotherapeutic drug resistance and potentiate antitumor immunity, herein a novel molecule Biotin&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;Cip&#8208;OH)&#8208;Lys(SA&#8208;CPT)&#8208;Phe&#8208;Phe&#8208;Nap (Biotin&#8208;Cip&#8208;CPT&#8208;Nap) is rationally designed containing four functional motifs (i.e., a biotin motif for targeting, Phe&#8208;Phe(&#8208;Nap) motif for self&#8208;assembly, ciprofloxacin derivative (Cip&#8208;OH) motif for antibacterial effect, and camptothecin (CPT) motif for chemotherapy). Using the designed molecule, a novel strategy of intracellular enzymatic nanofiber formation and synergistic antibacterium&#8208;enhanced chemotherapy and immunotherapy is achieved. Under endocytosis mediated by highly expressed biotin receptor in colorectal cancer cell membrane and the catalysis of highly expressed carboxylesterase in the cytoplasm, this novel molecule can be transformed into Biotin&#8208;Nap, which self&#8208;assembled into nanofibers. Meanwhile, antibiotic Cip&#8208;OH and chemotherapeutic drug CPT are released, overcoming bacterium&#8208;induced drug resistance and enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy towards colorectal cancer. This work offers a feasible strategy for the design of novel multifunctional prodrugs to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer treatment.

         <title>Nanofluid&#8208;Guided Janus Membrane for High&#8208;Efficiency Electricity Generation from Water Evaporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoconfined ionic liquids&#8208;guided evaporation power generator achieves high&#8208;efficiency performance with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and an ultra&#8208;high continuous operating time of 180 h, providing a new strategy for clean power generation technologies.








Abstract
Harvesting electricity from widespread water evaporation provides an alternative route to cleaner power generation technology. However, current evaporation power generation (EPG) mainly depends on the dissociation process of certain functional groups (e.g., SO3H) in water, which suffers from low power density and short&#8208;term output. Herein, the Janus membrane is prepared by combining nanofluid and water&#8208;grabbing material for EPG, where the nanoconfined ionic liquids (NCILs) serve as ion sources instead of the functional groups. Benefiting from the selective and fast transport of anions in NCILs, such EPG demonstrates excellent power performance with a voltage of 0.63&#160;V, a short&#8208;circuit current of 140&#160;&#181;A, and a maximum power density of 16.55 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 while operating for at least 180 h consistently. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and surface potential analysis reveal the molecular mechanism, that is, the diffusion of Cl&#8722; anions during evaporation is much faster than that of cations, generating the voltage and current across the membrane. Furthermore, the device performs well in varying environmental conditions, including different water temperatures and sources of evaporating water, showcasing its adaptability and integrability. Overall, the nanofluid&#8208;guided Janus membrane can efficiently transform low&#8208;grade thermal energy in evaporation into electricity, showing a competitive advantage over other sustainable applied approaches.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Efficiency of Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with In&#8208;Situ Interfacial Cross&#8208;Linked Modifier</title>

Moisture&#8208;assisted crosslink of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane forms a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) protective layer that not only effectively passivates perovskite surface defect, but also significantly enhances device moisture stability.








Abstract
Inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is potential as the top cells in tandem configurations, owing to the ideal bandgap, good thermal and light stability of inorganic perovskites. However, challenges such as mismatch of energy levels between charge transport layer and perovskite, significant non&#8208;radiative recombination caused by surface defects, and poor water stability have led to the urgent need for further improvement in the performance of inverted inorganic PSCs. Herein, the fabrication of efficient and stable CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSCs through surface treatment of (3&#8208;mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS), is reported. The silane groups in MPTS can in situ crosslink in the presence of moisture to build a 3&#8208;dimensional (3D) network by Si&#8208;O&#8208;Si bonds, which forms a hydrophobic layer on perovskite surface to inhibit water invasion. Additionally, &#8208;SH can strongly interact with the undercoordinated Pb2+ at the perovskite surface, effectively minimizing interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the efficiency of the inverted inorganic PSCs improves dramatically from 19.0% to 21.0% under 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 illumination with MPTS treatment. Remarkably, perovskite films with crosslinked MPTS exhibit superior stability when soaking in water. The optimized PSC maintains 91% of its initial efficiency after aging 1000 h in ambient atmosphere, and 86% in 800 h of operational stability testing.

&lt;p&gt;Moisture-assisted crosslink of (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane forms a 3-dimensional (3D) protective layer that not only effectively passivates perovskite surface defect, but also significantly enhances device moisture stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is potential as the top cells in tandem configurations, owing to the ideal bandgap, good thermal and light stability of inorganic perovskites. However, challenges such as mismatch of energy levels between charge transport layer and perovskite, significant non-radiative recombination caused by surface defects, and poor water stability have led to the urgent need for further improvement in the performance of inverted inorganic PSCs. Herein, the fabrication of efficient and stable CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; PSCs through surface treatment of (3-mercaptopropyl) trimethoxysilane (MPTS), is reported. The silane groups in MPTS can in situ crosslink in the presence of moisture to build a 3-dimensional (3D) network by Si-O-Si bonds, which forms a hydrophobic layer on perovskite surface to inhibit water invasion. Additionally, -SH can strongly interact with the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; at the perovskite surface, effectively minimizing interfacial charge recombination. Consequently, the efficiency of the inverted inorganic PSCs improves dramatically from 19.0% to 21.0% under 100&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; illumination with MPTS treatment. Remarkably, perovskite films with crosslinked MPTS exhibit superior stability when soaking in water.

         <title>Sustained and Localized Drug Depot Release Using Radiation&#8208;Activated Scintillating Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical cancer treatment often involves X&#8208;ray radiation therapy, and spatially precise radiation treatment offers the possibility of improving the therapeutic window of systemic chemotherapies designed to be activated by irradiation. This work presents scintillating nanoparticles that generate light in response to irradiation, uncaging a reservoir of sustained chemotherapy release within tumor tissue while sparing off&#8208;target sites of toxicity.








Abstract
Clinical treatment of cancer commonly incorporates X&#8208;ray radiation therapy (XRT), and developing spatially precise radiation&#8208;activatable drug delivery strategies may improve XRT efficacy while limiting off&#8208;target toxicities associated with systemically administered drugs. Nevertheless, achieving this has been challenging thus far because strategies typically rely on radical species with short lifespans, and the inherent nature of hypoxic and acidic tumor microenvironments may encourage spatially heterogeneous effects. It is hypothesized that the challenge could be bypassed by using scintillating nanoparticles that emit light upon X&#8208;ray absorption, locally forming therapeutic drug depots in tumor tissues. Thus a nanoparticle platform (Scintillating nanoparticle Drug Depot; SciDD) that enables the local release of cytotoxic payloads only after activation by XRT is developed, thereby limiting off&#8208;target toxicity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, SciDD is used to deliver a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing payload MMAE (monomethyl auristatin E). With as little as a 2&#160;Gy local irradiation to tumors, MMAE payloads are released effectively to kill tumor cells. XRT&#8208;mediated drug release is demonstrated in multiple mouse cancer models and showed efficacy over XRT alone (p&#160;&lt;&#160;0.0001). This work shows that SciDD can act as a local drug depot with spatiotemporally controlled release of cancer therapeutics.

         <title>Acoustic Higher&#8208;Order Topological Insulators Induced by Orbital&#8208;Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orbital&#8208;interactions between degenerate acoustic cavity modes are introduced to demonstrate versatile higher&#8208;order corner states and orbital&#8208;dependent edge states embedded in the bulk, opening the avenue for exploring orbital&#8208;related topological physics and sound&#8208;wave interaction beyond the single&#8208;orbital systems. It also provides new opportunities for the applications such as sound trapping and sensing.








Abstract
The discovery of higher&#8208;order topological insulator metamaterials, in analogy with their condensed&#8208;matter counterparts, has enabled various breakthroughs in photonics, mechanics, and acoustics. A common way of inducing higher&#8208;order topological wave phenomena is through pseudo&#8208;spins, which mimic the electron spins as a symmetry&#8208;breaking degree of freedom. Here, this work exploits degenerate orbitals in acoustic resonant cavities to demonstrate versatile, orbital&#8208;selective, higher&#8208;order topological corner states. Type&#8208;II corner states are theoretically investigated and experimentally demonstrated based on tailored orbital interactions, without the need for long&#8208;range hoppings that has so far served as a key ingredient for Type&#8208;II corner states in single&#8208;orbital systems. Due to the orthogonal nature of the degenerate p orbitals, this work also introduces a universal strategy to realize orbital&#8208;dependent edge modes, featuring high&#8208;Q edge states identified in bulk bands. These findings provide an understanding of the interplay between acoustic orbitals and topology, shedding light on orbital&#8208;related topological wave physics, as well as its applications for acoustic sensing and trapping.

         <title>Reversible Optical Control of Polarization in Epitaxial Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is accomplished in epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT) thin films using UV light. For single&#8208;domain films, a transient modulation of the polarization magnitude occurs, mediated by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers in the Schottky interface. In PZT films at the morphotropic phase boundary, room&#8208;temperature remanent optical poling is realized that can be reversed via thermal annealing.








Abstract
Light is an effective tool to probe the polarization and domain distribution in ferroelectric materials passively, that is, non&#8208;invasively, for example, via optical second harmonic generation (SHG). With the emergence of oxide electronics, there is now a strong demand to expand the role of light toward active control of the polarization. In this work, optical control of the ferroelectric polarization is demonstrated&#160;in prototypical epitaxial PbZrxTi1&#8722;xO3 (PZT)&#8208;based heterostructures. This is accomplished in three steps, using above&#8208;bandgap UV light, while tracking the response of the polarization with optical SHG. First, it is found that UV&#8208;light exposure induces a transient enhancement or suppression of the ferroelectric polarization in films with an upward&#8208; or downward&#8208;oriented polarization, respectively. This behavior is attributed to a modified charge screening driven by the separation of photoexcited charge carriers at the Schottky interface of the ferroelectric thin film. Second, by taking advantage of this optical handle on electrostatics, remanent optical poling from a pristine multi&#8208;domain into a single&#8208;domain configuration is accomplished. Third, via thermal annealing or engineered electrostatic boundary conditions, a complete reversibility of the optical poling is further achieved. Hence, this work paves the way for the all&#8208;optical control of the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectric thin&#160;films.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment Remodeling&#8208;Mediated Sequential Drug Delivery Potentiates Treatment Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the vascular disrupting agent (CA4&#8208;NPs) to specifically remodel the tumor microenvironment by combining coagulation and hypoxia. Apitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3, a nanocarrier for immunotherapy, subsequently recognizes and targets tumor coagulation. Under hypoxia, IMDQ is selectively activated. This strategy boosts delivery efficacy and reduces systemic toxicity of IMDQ. It successfully eradicates 4T1 and CT26 tumors (500 mm3) without recurrence.








Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonists, such as imidazoquinolines (IMDQs), are promising for the de novo priming of antitumor immunity. However, their systemic administration is severely limited due to the off&#8208;target toxicity. Here, this work describes a sequential drug delivery strategy. The formulation is composed of two sequential modules: a tumor microenvironment remodeling nanocarrier (poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4, termed CA4&#8208;NPs) and an immunotherapy nanocarrier (apcitide peptide&#8208;decorated poly(l&#8208;glutamic acid)&#8208;graft&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 conjugate, termed apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3). CA4&#8208;NPs, as a vascular disrupting agent, are utilized to remodel the tumor microenvironment for enhancing tumor coagulation and hypoxia. Subsequently, the apcitide&#8208;PLG&#8208;IMDQ&#8208;N3 could identify and target tumor coagulation through the binding of surface apcitide peptide to the GPIIb&#8208;IIIa on activated platelets. Afterward, IMDQ is activated selectively through the conversion of &#8220;&#8208;N3&#8221; to &#8220;&#8208;NH2&#8221; in the presence of hypoxia. The biodistribution results confirm their high tumor uptake of activated IMDQ (22.66%ID/g). By augmenting the priming and immunologic memory of tumor&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells, 4T1 and CT26 tumors with a size of &#8776;500 mm3 are eradicated without recurrence in mouse models.

This strategy boosts delivery efficacy and reduces systemic toxicity of IMDQ. It successfully eradicates 4T1 and CT26 tumors (500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) without recurrence.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonists, such as imidazoquinolines (IMDQs), are promising for the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; priming of antitumor immunity. However, their systemic administration is severely limited due to the off-target toxicity. Here, this work describes a sequential drug delivery strategy. The formulation is composed of two sequential modules: a tumor microenvironment remodeling nanocarrier (poly(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamic acid)-&lt;i&gt;graft-&lt;/i&gt;methoxy poly(ethylene glycol)/combretastatin A4, termed CA4-NPs) and an immunotherapy nanocarrier (apcitide peptide-decorated poly(&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;-glutamic acid)-&lt;i&gt;graft&lt;/i&gt;-IMDQ-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; conjugate, termed apcitide-PLG-IMDQ-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). CA4-NPs, as a vascular disrupting agent, are utilized to remodel the tumor microenvironment for enhancing tumor coagulation and hypoxia. Subsequently, the apcitide-PLG-IMDQ-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could identify and target tumor coagulation through the binding of surface apcitide peptide to the GPIIb-IIIa on activated platelets. Afterward, IMDQ is activated selectively through the conversion of &#8220;-N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; to &#8220;-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8221; in the presence of hypoxia. The biodistribution results confirm their high tumor uptake of activated IMDQ (22.66%ID/g). By augmenting the priming and immunologic memory of tumor-specific CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, 4T1 and CT26 tumors with a size of &#8776;500 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; are eradicated without recurrence in mouse models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Orbital Occupancy Modulation to Optimize Intermediate Absorption for Efficient Electrocatalysts in Water Electrolysis and Zinc&#8211;Ethanol&#8211;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the coordinating environment (coordinated atoms substitution and crystalline symmetry change) of the o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is successfully regulated to optimize its dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy. Additionally, the transformation of the ligand field caused by the reconstruction further modulates the spin configuration of the catalyst and the moderate dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy enhances the ethanol oxidiation.








Abstract
Spin engineering is a promising way to modulate the interaction between the metal d&#8208;orbital and the intermediates and thus enhance the catalytic kinetics. Herein, an innovative strategy is reported to modulate the spin state of Co by regulating its coordinating environment. o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni is prepared as pre&#8208;catalyst, then in situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)&#160;and in situ Raman spectroscopy are employed to prove phase transition, and CoOOH/Co3O4 is formed on the surface as active sites. In hybrid water electrolysis, the voltage has a negative shift, and in zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery, the charging voltage is lowered and the cycling stability is greatly increased. Coordinated atom substitution and crystalline symmetry change are combined to regulate the absorption ability of reaction intermediates with balanced optimal adsorption. Coordinated atom substitution weakens the adsorption while the crystalline symmetry change strengthens the adsorption. Importantly, the tetrahedral sites are introduced by Ni doping which enables the co&#8208;existence of four&#8208;coordinated sites and six&#8208;coordination sites in o&#8208;c&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;Ni. The dz2 + dx2&#8208;y2 orbital occupancy decreases after the atomic substitution, while increases after replacing the CoSe6&#8208;Oh field with CoSe6&#8208;Oh/CoSe4&#8208;Td. This work explores a new direction for the preparation of efficient catalysts for water electrolysis and innovative zinc&#8211;ethanol&#8211;air battery.

         <title>Highly Stable Organic Molecular Porous Solid Electrolyte with One&#8208;Dimensional Ion Migration Channel for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8722;Oxygen Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>

Organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril as the solid&#8208;state electrolyte for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. The 1D ion migration channel achieves the Li+ fast conduction and the noncovalent interactions facilitate the immobilization of anions, realizing Li+ uniform distribution, as well as endowing the solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium&#8722;oxygen (Li&#8722;O2) batteries have been widely recognized as one of the candidates for the next&#8208;generation of energy storage batteries. However, the development of solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries has been hindered by the lack of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) with high ionic conductivity at room temperature, high Li+ transference number, and the high stability to air. Herein, the organic molecular porous solid cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) with one&#8208;dimensional (1D)&#160;ion migration channels is developed as the SSE for solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Taking advantage of the 1D ion migration channel for Li+ conduction, CB[7] SSE achieves high ionic conductivity (2.45&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 S&#8201;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C). Moreover, the noncovalent interactions facilitated the immobilization of anions, realizing a high Li+ transference number (tLi+ = 0.81) and Li+ uniform distribution. The CB[7] SSE also shows a wide electrochemical stability window of 0&#8211;4.65&#160;V and high thermal stability and chemical stability, as well as realizes stable Li+ plating/stripping (more than 1000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). As a result, the CB[7] SSE endows solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries with superior rate capability and long&#8208;term discharge/charge stability (up to 500&#160;h). This design strategy of CB[7] SSE paves the way for stable and efficient solid&#8208;state Li&#8722;O2 batteries toward practical applications.

         <title>Van der Waals Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals (vdW) force has been regarded as a versatile and universal potential. Nevertheless, whether vdW force can be used as an attractive potential for the crystallization of colloids remains to be proven. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids can reconfigure vdW force to optimal range in terms of colloidal crystallizations.








Abstract
A general guiding principle for colloidal crystallization is to tame the attractive enthalpy such that it slightly overwhelms the repulsive interaction. As&#8208;synthesized colloids are generally designed to retain a strong repulsive potential for the high stability of suspensions, encoding appropriate attractive potentials into colloids has been key to their crystallization. Despite the myriad of interparticle attractions for colloidal crystallization, the van der Waals (vdW) force remains unexplored. Here, it is shown that the implementation of gold cores into silica colloids and the resulting vdW force can reconfigure the pair potential well depth to the optimal range between &#8722;1 and &#8722;4 kBT at tens of nanometer&#8208;scale colloidal distances. As such, colloidal crystals with a distinct liquid gap can be formed, which is evidenced by photonic bandgap&#8208;based diffractive colorization.

         <title>Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanostructured Viologen&#8208;Siloxane Materials for Controllable Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable approach for tunable properties of viologen&#8208;siloxane block molecules is presented, where the counterion dictates morphology, domain spacing, and conductivity. A light&#8208;responsive counterion is used to reduce the viologen in situ, enhancing its conductivity. The radical cation is stable for several days and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. Repeated pulsed&#8208;light irradiation results in a continuum of conductive states, exhibiting behavior resemblant to long&#8208;term potentiation.








Abstract
Spontaneous phase separation is a promising strategy for the development of novel electronic materials, as the resulting well&#8208;defined morphologies generally exhibit enhanced conductivity. Making these structures adaptive to external stimuli is challenging, yet crucial as multistate reconfigurable switching is essential for neuromorphic materials.

&lt;p&gt;A scalable approach for tunable properties of viologen-siloxane block molecules is presented, where the counterion dictates morphology, domain spacing, and conductivity. A light-responsive counterion is used to reduce the viologen in situ, enhancing its conductivity. The radical cation is stable for several days and can be reversibly oxidized and reduced. Repeated pulsed-light irradiation results in a continuum of conductive states, exhibiting behavior resemblant to long-term potentiation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous phase separation is a promising strategy for the development of novel electronic materials, as the resulting well-defined morphologies generally exhibit enhanced conductivity. Making these structures adaptive to external stimuli is challenging, yet crucial as multistate reconfigurable switching is essential for neuromorphic materials. Here, a modular and scalable approach is presented to obtain switchable phase-separated viologen-siloxane nanostructures with sub-5&#160;nm features. The domain spacing, morphology, and conductivity of these materials can be tuned by ion exchange, repeated pulsed photoirradiation and electric stimulation. Counterion exchange triggers a postsynthetic modification in domain spacing of up to 10%. Additionally, in some cases, 2D to 1D order&#8211;order transitions are observed with the latter exhibiting a sevenfold decrease in conductivity with respect to their 2D lamellar counterparts. Moreover, the combination of the viologen core with tetraphenylborate counterions enables reversible and in situ reduction upon light irradiation.

         <title>Ultraflexible Temperature&#8208;Strain Dual&#8208;Sensor Based on Chalcogenide Glass&#8208;Polymer Film for Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is developed for fabricating ultraflexible thermoelectric films with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance, and a prototypical robotic hand for intelligent action feedback and temperature alarm is demonstrated. This work not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic thermoelectric devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like thermoelectric (TE) films with temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing functions are highly desirable for human&#8208;machine interaction systems and wearable devices. However, current TE films still face challenges in achieving high flexibility and excellent sensing performance simultaneously. Herein, for the first time, a facile roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll strategy is proposed to fabricate an ultraflexible chalcogenide glass&#8208;polytetrafluoroethylene composite film with superior temperature&#8208; and strain&#8208;sensing performance. The unique reticular network of the composite film endows it with efficient Seebeck effect and flexibility, leading to a high Seebeck coefficient (731 &#181;V/K), rapid temperature response (&#8776;0.7 s), and excellent strain sensitivity (gauge factor = 836). Based on this high&#8208;performance composite film, an intelligent robotic hand for action feedback and temperature alarm is fabricated, demonstrating its great potential in human&#8208;machine interaction. Such TE film fabrication strategy not only brings new inspiration for wearable inorganic TE devices, but also sets the stage for a wide implementation of multifunctional human&#8208;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Fast Li Replenishment Channels&#8208;Assisted Recycling of Degraded Layered Cathodes with Enhanced Cycling Performance and Thermal Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LiCo0.5Mn0.5BO3 (LCMB) coating bonds with the rock salt/spinel phase on degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523), forming new Li replenishment channels with a reduced diffusion energy barrier. Therefore, a very small amount of LiOH and short&#8208;time sintering are adequate for fully regeneration. The repaired LCMB&#8208;NCM523 presents high discharge specific capacity and excellent cycling performance and thermal stability.








Abstract
The direct recycling of cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries is important for environmental protection and resource conservation. The key regeneration processes are composition replenishment and atom rearrangement, both of which depend on the migration and diffusion of atoms. However, for the direct recycling of degraded LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (D&#8208;NCM523) cathode, the irreversible phase transitions that accumulate during the long&#8208;term cycles block the Li diffusion channels with a high diffusion energy barrier, making it difficult to fully repair the layered structure and resulting in rapid capacity decay. To address the challenge, fast Li replenishment channels are rebuilt to regulate the surface phase and effectively assist the regeneration process with a reduced energy barrier. This method reduces the amount of Li supplement by &gt;75% and shortens the sintering time (only 2&#160;h) to fully regenerate D&#8208;NCM523, compared to general direct recycling methods. The regenerated NCM523 (LCMB&#8208;NCM523) exhibits a satisfactory repaired specific capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability, retaining 78% of its capacity after 300 cycles. In addition, LCMB&#8208;NCM523 is recycled with improved thermal decomposition peak temperature and enables 200 cycles even at 60&#160;&#176;C, greatly improving safety. This work proposes a promising way for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of layered cathodes.

         <title>Polymeric Conductive Adhesive&#8208;Based Ultrathin Epidermal Electrodes for Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of Electrophysiological Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin conductive adhesive&#8208;based epidermal electrode with enhanced adhesion and intrinsic stretchability, optimizing conformity even during movement and ensuring prolonged sustainability, is demonstrated. A theoretical analysis is also conducted to design the electrode materials and design. By these efforts, continuous monitoring of ECG signals is conducted for 168 h (1 week) without any significant motion artifacts and signal degradation.








Abstract
Electrophysiology, exploring vital electrical phenomena in living organisms, anticipates broader integration into daily life through wearable devices and epidermal electrodes. However, addressing the challenges of the electrode durability and motion artifacts is essential to enable continuous and long&#8208;term biopotential signal monitoring, presenting a hurdle for its seamless implementation in daily life. To address these challenges, an ultrathin polymeric conductive adhesive,&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate)/polyvinyl alcohol/d&#8208;sorbitol (PPd) electrode with enhanced adhesion, stretchability, and skin conformability, is presented. The skin conformability and stability of electrodes is designed by theoretical criteria obtained by mechanical analysis.&#160;Thus, impedance stability is obtained over 1&#8208;week of daily life, and the PPd electrode addresses the challenges related to durability during prolonged usage. Proving stability in electromyography (EMG) signals during high&#8208;intensity exercise, the wireless PPd measurement system exhibits high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) signals even in situations involving significant and repetitive skin deformation. Throughout continuous 1 week&#8208;long electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life, the system consistently preserves signal quality, underscoring the heightened durability and applicability of the PPd measurement system.

         <title>3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers with Locally Varying Mechanical Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ink composed of jammed precursor&#8208;loaded elastomeric microparticles that can be direct ink written into double network granular elastomers that can attain a wide range of stiffnesses and ultimate tensile strains is presented. Inks with different stiffnesses can be 3D printed into cm&#8208;sized structures with locally varying compositions and hence mechanical properties using commercial multinozzle 3D printers.








Abstract
Fast advances in the design of soft actuators and robots demand for new soft materials whose mechanical properties can be changed over short length scales. Elastomers can be formulated as highly stretchable or rather stiff materials and hence, are attractive for these applications. They are most frequently cast such that their composition cannot be changed over short length scales. A method that allows to locally change the composition of elastomers on hundreds of micrometer lengths scales is direct ink writing (DIW). Unfortunately, in the absence of rheomodifiers, most elastomer precursors cannot be printed through DIW. Here, 3D printable double network granular elastomers (DNGEs) whose ultimate tensile strain and stiffness can be varied over an unprecedented range are introduced. The 3D printability of these materials is leveraged to produce an elastomer finger containing rigid bones that are surrounded by a soft skin. Similarly, the rheological properties of the microparticle&#8208;based precursors are leveraged to cast elastomer slabs with locally varying stiffnesses that deform and twist in a predefined fashion. These DNGEs are foreseen to open up new avenues in the design of the next generation of smart wearables, strain sensors, prosthesis, soft actuators, and robots.

Similarly, the rheological properties of the microparticle-based precursors are leveraged to cast elastomer slabs with locally varying stiffnesses that deform and twist in a predefined fashion. These DNGEs are foreseen to open up new avenues in the design of the next generation of smart wearables, strain sensors, prosthesis, soft actuators, and robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anisotropic Morphing in Bistable Kirigami through Symmetry Breaking and Geometric Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Symmetry breaking of slit pattern in bistable kirigami metamaterials is leveraged to generate geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D shape deployment. The role played by symmetry groups in the nonuniform scaling of bistable kirigami metamaterials is first mapped in the entire morphing space and then harnessed as design strategy for demonstrating arbitrary scaled bistable deployment.








Abstract
Shape morphing in bistable kirigami enables remarkable functionalities appealing to a diverse range of applications across the spectrum of length scale. At the core of their shape shifting lies the architecture of their repeating unit, where highly deformable slits and quasi&#8208;rigid rotating units often exhibit multiple symmetries that confer isotropic deployment obeying uniform scaling transformation. In this work, symmetry breaking in bistable kirigami is investigated to access geometric frustration and anisotropic morphing, enabling arbitrarily scaled deployment in planar and spatial bistable domains. With an analysis on their symmetry properties complemented by a systematic investigation integrating semi&#8208;analytical derivations, numerical simulations, and experiments on elastic kirigami sheets, this work unveils the fundamental relations between slit symmetry, geometric frustration, and anisotropic bistable deployment. Furthermore, asymmetric kirigami units are leveraged in planar and flat&#8208;to&#8208;3D demonstrations to showcase the pivotal role of shear deformation in achieving target shapes and functions so far unattainable with uniformly stretchable kirigami. The insights provided in this work unveil the role of slit symmetry breaking in controlling the anisotropic bistable deployment of soft kirigami metamaterials, enriching the range of achievable functionalities for applications spanning deployable space structures, wearable technologies, and soft machines.

         <title>Boosted Second Harmonic Generation and Cascaded Sum Frequency Generation from a Surface Crystallized Glass Ceramic Microcavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation (CSFG) are demonstrated in microspheres made of surface crystallized glass ceramics. Owing to random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm is demonstrated. The microspheres also boost the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of CSFG.








Abstract
The development of novel materials and structures for efficient second&#8208;order nonlinear micro/nano devices remains a significant challenge. In this study, the remarkable enhancement of second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) and cascaded sum frequency generation in whispering gallery mode microspheres made of surface&#8208;crystallized glass with a 6&#8208;&#181;m Ba2TiSi2O8 crystal layer are demonstrated. Attributed to the core&#8211;shell design, the Ba2TiSi2O8 located on the surface can be efficiently coupled with whispering gallery modes, resulting in a highly efficient micron&#8208;scale cavity&#8208;enhanced second&#8208;order optical nonlinearity. Greatly enhanced SHG of the microcavity is observed, which is up to 80 times stronger than that of a non&#8208;resonant sample. Furthermore, owing to the wavelength non&#8208;selectivity of random quasi&#8208;phase matching, ultra&#8208;wideband SHG with a strong response ranging from 860 to 1600&#160;nm and high&#8208;contrast polarization characteristics is demonstrated. The glass&#8208;ceramic&#8208;based microsphere cavity also boosts the cascading optical nonlinearity, manifested by a two&#8208;magnitude enhancement of cascaded sum frequency generation. This work delineates an efficient strategy for boosting nonlinear optical response in glass ceramics, which will open up new opportunities for applications in photonics and optical communications.

         <title>Enhanced Piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 by the Introduction of MXene and Its Utilization in Boosting High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research details a strategy to boost the piezoelectric performance of MAPbI3 by using a MXene substrate. It is demonstrated that the surface OH groups on the MXene induce a stronger polarization of the MA+ ions in the MAPbI3 compared to that of the O and F groups, leading to a much more enhanced piezoelectric effect. An innovative type of flexible photodetector (PD) based on a piezoelectric MXene/MAPbI3 heterostructure is crafted, which can be enhanced simultaneously by the piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects. Utilizing MXene to boost the piezoelectricity of MAPbI3 reveals wide&#8208;range potentials for future optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Recently, perovskite photodetectors (PDs) are risen to prominence due to substantial research interest. Beyond merely tweaking the composition of materials, a cutting&#8208;edge advancement lies in leveraging the innate piezoelectric polarization properties of perovskites themselves. Here, the investigation shows utilizing Ti3C2Tx, a typical MXene, as an intermediate layer for significantly boosting the piezoelectric property of MAPbI3 thin films. This improvement is primarily attributed to the enhanced polarization of the methylammonium (MA+) groups within MAPbI3, induced by the OH groups present in Ti3C2Tx. A flexible PD based on the MAPbI3/MXene heterostructure is then fabricated. The new device is sensitive to a wide range of wavelengths, displays greatly enhanced performance owing to the piezo&#8208;phototronic coupling. Moreover, the device is endowed with a greatly reduced response time, down to millisecond level, through the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The characterization shows applying a &#8722;1.2% compressive strain on the PD leads to a remarkable 102% increase in the common photocurrent, and a 76% increase in the pyro&#8208;phototronic current. The present work reveals how the emerging piezo&#8208;phototronic and pyro&#8208;phototronic effects can be employed to design high&#8208;performance flexible perovskite PDs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Large Stress and Strain Polymer Nanocomposite Actuators Incorporating a Mutually&#8208;Interpenetrated, Collective&#8208;Deformation Carbon Nanotube Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collective strategy for fabricating nanocomposites is demonstrated by incorporating a carbon nanotube (CNT) sponge into a SMP matrix. The synergistic deformation and actuation lead to extraordinary performance, including high output stress, strain, and fast response, surpassing the majority of conventional SMP&#8208;based composites and suggesting promising applications such as artificial muscles and low&#8208;temperature biomedical devices.








Abstract
Stimulus&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;based actuators are extensively studied, with the challenging goal of achieving comprehensive performance metrics that include large output stress and strain, fast response, and versatile actuation modes. The design and fabrication of nanocomposites offer a promising route to integrate the advantages of both polymers and nanoscale fillers, thus ensuring superior performance. Here, it is started from a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous sponge to fabricate a mutually interpenetrated nanocomposite, in which the embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) network undergoes collective deformation with the shape memory polymer (SMP) matrix during large&#8208;degree stretching and releasing, increases junction density with polymer chains and enhances molecular orientation. These features result in substantial improvement of the overall mechanical properties and during thermally actuated contraction, the bulk SMP/CNT composites exhibit output stresses up to 19.5 &#177; 0.97&#160;MPa and strains up to 69%, accompanied by a rapid response and high energy density, exceeding the majority of recent reports. Furthermore, electrical actuation is also demonstrated via uniform Joule heating across the self&#8208;percolated CNT network. Applications such as low&#8208;temperature thermal actuated vascular stent and wound dressing are explored. These findings lay out a universal blueprint for developing robust and highly deformable SMP/CNT nanocomposite actuators with broad potential applications.

         <title>Meta&#8208;Attention Network Based Spectral Reconstruction with Snapshot Near&#8208;Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact near&#8208;infrared (NIR) metasurface composed of 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures is proposed, and a novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the hyperspectral images. By leveraging the system, the NIR spectral images which exhibit precise textures and negligible crosstalk are precisely reconstructed.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral information is important for detecting and analyzing material compositions. However, snapshot NIR spectral imaging systems still pose significant challenges owing to the lack of high&#8208;performance NIR filters and bulky setups, preventing effective encoding and integration with mobile devices. This study introduces a snapshot spectral imaging system that employs a compact NIR metasurface featuring 25 distinct C4 symmetry structures. Benefitting from the sufficient spectral variety and low correlation coefficient among these structures, center&#8208;wavelength accuracy of 0.05&#160;nm and full width at half maximum accuracy of 0.13&#160;nm are realized. The system maintains good performance within an incident angle of 1&#176;. A novel meta&#8208;attention network prior iterative denoising reconstruction (MAN&#8208;IDR) algorithm is developed to achieve high&#8208;quality NIR spectral imaging. By leveraging the designed metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR, the NIR spectral images, exhibiting precise textures, minimal artifacts in the spatial dimension, and little crosstalk between spectral channels, are reconstructed from a single grayscale recording image. The proposed NIR metasurface and MAN&#8208;IDR hold great promise for further integration with smartphones and drones, guaranteeing the adoption of NIR spectral imaging in real&#8208;world scenarios such as aerospace, health diagnostics, and machine vision.

         <title>Spatial Structure Design of Thioether&#8208;Linked Naphthoquinone Cathodes for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Organic Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>

The naphthoquinone derivative isomers with nonplanar and partially conjugated structures have been designed to guarantee high structure stability and redox unit independence, realizing the construction of Zn&#8208;organic batteries with high achievable capacity, stable cycling performance, and ultrarapid rate capability.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials (OEMs) have gathered extensive attention for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) due to their structural diversity and molecular designability. However, the reported research mainly focuses on the design of the planar configuration of OEMs and does not take into account the important influence of the spatial structure on the electrochemical properties, which seriously hamper the further performance liberation of OEMs. Herein, this work has designed a series of thioether&#8208;linked naphthoquinone&#8208;derived isomers with tunable spatial structures and applied them as the cathodes in AZIBs. The incomplete conjugated structure of the elaborately engineered isomers can guarantee the independence of the redox reaction of active groups, which contributes to the full utilization of active sites and high redox reversibility. In addition, the position isomerization of naphthoquinones on the benzene rings changes the zincophilic activity and redox kinetics of the isomers, signifying the importance of spatial structure on the electrochemical performance. As a result, the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(1,4&#8208;phenylenedithio) bis(1,4&#8208;naphthoquinone) (p&#8208;PNQ) with the smallest steric hindrance and the most independent redox of active sites exhibits a high specific capacity (279 mAh g&#8722;1), an outstanding rate capability (167 mAh g&#8722;1 at 100 A g&#8722;1), and a long&#8208;term cycling lifetime (over 2800&#160;h at 0.05 A g&#8722;1).

         <title>Eliminating the Burn&#8208;in Loss of Efficiency in Organic Solar Cells by Applying Dimer Acceptors as Supramolecular Stabilizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reliable dimer supramolecular stabilizer strategy is developed to eliminate the burn&#8208;in loss of organic solar cells (OSCs). More mechanism studies reveal that the restricted molecular diffusion, robust morphology, and low&#8208;level trap state density are keys to address the burn&#8208;in loss, resulting in a long T98 lifetime over 600 h under the maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking (MPPT) with a PCE over 19%.








Abstract
The meta&#8208;stable active layer morphology of organic solar cells (OSCs) is identified as the main cause of the rapid burn&#8208;in loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) during long&#8208;term device operation. However, effective strategies to eliminate the associated loss mechanisms from the initial stage of device operation are still lacking, especially for high&#8208;efficiency material systems. Herein, the introduction of molecularly engineered dimer acceptors with adjustable thermal transition properties into the active layer of OSCs to serve as supramolecular stabilizers for regulating the thermal transitions and optimizing the crystallization of the absorber composites is reported. By establishing intimate &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions with small&#8208;molecule acceptors, these stabilizers can effectively reduce the trap&#8208;state density (Nt) in the devices to achieve excellent PCEs over 19%. More importantly, the low Nt associated with an initially optimized morphology can be maintained under external stresses to significantly reduce the PCE burn&#8208;in loss in devices. This research reveals a judicious approach to improving OPV stability by establishing a comprehensive correlation between material properties, active&#8208;layer morphology, and device performance, for developing burn&#8208;in&#8208;free OSCs.

         <title>Enhancing Stability and Performance in Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Field&#8208;Effect Transistors Through Hydrogen Bond Suppression of Organic Cation Migration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High background carrier density in FASnI3 transistors is elucidated, originating from both Sn2+ oxidation and FA+ ion migration. The development of a hydrogen bond strategy through the integration of fluorine&#8208;substituted additives effectively suppresses cation migration, thereby reducing background carrier density and enhancing operational stability of the transistors. An impressive effective mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Ion migration poses a substantial challenge in perovskite transistors, exerting detrimental effects on hysteresis and operational stability. This study focuses on elucidating the influence of ion migration on the performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). It is revealed that the high background carrier density in FASnI3 FETs arises not only from the oxidation of Sn2+ but also from the migration of FA+ ions. The formation of hydrogen bonding between FA+ and F&#8722; ions efficiently inhibits ion migration, leading to a reduction in background carrier density and an improvement in the operational stability of the transistors. The strategy of hydrogen bond is extended to fluorine&#8208;substituted additives to improve device performance. The incorporation of 4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium iodide additives into FETs significantly minimizes the shift of turn&#8208;on voltage during cyclic measurements. Notably, an effective mobility of up to 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with an Ion/off ratio of 107 is achieved. These findings hold promising potential for advancing tin&#8208;based perovskite technology in the field of electronics.

Various moir&#233; superlattices, including twisted homobilayers, twisted heterobilayers, and twisted multilayer superlattices, are efficiently and precisely constructed by picking&#8208;up and stacking these 2D layers using a dry&#8208;transfer method.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices, consisting of rotationally aligned 2D atomically thin layers, provide a highly novel platform for the study of correlated quantum phenomena. However, reliable and efficient construction of moir&#233; superlattices is challenging because of difficulties to accurately angle&#8208;align small exfoliated 2D layers and the need to shun wet&#8208;transfer processes. Here, efficient and precise construction of various moir&#233; superlattices is demonstrated by picking up and stacking large&#8208;area 2D mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer crystals with predetermined crystal axes, made possible by a gold&#8208;template&#8208;assisted mechanical exfoliation method. The exfoliated 2D layers are semiconductors, superconductors, or magnets and their high quality is confirmed by photoluminescence and Raman spectra and by electrical transport measurements of fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors and Hall devices. Twisted homobilayers with angle&#8208;twisting accuracy of &#8776;0.3&#176;, twisted heterobilayers with sub&#8208;degree angle&#8208;alignment accuracy, and multilayer superlattices are precisely constructed and characterized by their moir&#233; patterns, interlayer excitons, and second harmonic generation. The present study paves the way for exploring emergent phenomena in moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>Area&#8208;Selective Chemical Vapor Deposition of Gold by Electron Beam Seeding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an area&#8208;selective chemical vapor deposition of gold is demonstrated. A metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 is used to create an autocatalytically active seed layer by electron beam deposition for further film growth at sub&#8208;100 &#176;C temperatures. In addition, this process provides a novel method for determining local temperature increases during electron beam writing.








Abstract
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an established method for producing high&#8208;purity thin films, but it typically necessitates the pre&#8208; and post&#8208;processing using a mask to produce structures. This study presents a novel maskless patterning technique that enables area&#8208;selective CVD of gold. A focused electron beam is used to decompose the metal&#8211;organic precursor Au(acac)Me2 locally, thereby creating an autocatalytically active seed layer for subsequent CVD with the same precursor. The procedure can be included in the same CVD process without the need for clean room lithographic processing. Moreover, it operates at low temperatures of 80 &#176;C, over 200&#160;K lower than standard CVD temperatures for this precursor, reducing thermal load on the specimen. Given that electron beam seeding operates on any even moderately conductive surface, the process does not constrain device design. This is demonstrated by the example of vertical nanostructures with high aspect ratios of &#8776;40:1 and more. Written using a focused electron beam and the same precursor, these nanopillars exhibit catalytically active nuclei on their surface. Furthermore, by using the onset of the autocatalytic CVD growth, for the first time the local temperature increase caused by the writing of nanostructures with an electron beam can be precisely&#160;determined.

         <title>Mechanical Control of Quantum Transport in Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. This work opens opportunities to harness straintronics effects in 2DM quantum technologies.








Abstract
2D materials (2DMs) are fundamentally electro&#8208;mechanical systems. Their environment unavoidably strains them and modifies their quantum transport properties. For instance, a simple uniaxial strain can completely turn off the conductance of ballistic graphene or switch on/off the superconducting phase of magic&#8208;angle bilayer graphene. This article reports measurements of quantum transport in strained graphene transistors which agree quantitatively with models based on mechanically&#8208;induced gauge potentials. A scalar potential is mechanically induced in situ to modify graphene's work function by up to 25 meV. Mechanically generated vector potentials suppress the ballistic conductance of graphene by up to 30% and control its quantum interferences. The data are measured with a custom experimental platform able to precisely tune both the mechanics and electrostatics of suspended graphene transistors at low&#8208;temperature over a broad range of strain (up to 2.6%). This work opens many opportunities to harness quantitative strain effects in 2DM quantum transport and&#160;technologies.

         <title>Stereo&#8208;Hindrance Engineering of A Cation toward &lt;110&gt;&#8208;Oriented 2D Perovskite with Minimized Tilting and High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>

A &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D&#160;EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) perovskite with minimized tilting and interlayer distance is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group pushes Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb angle &#8776;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting and electron&#8211;phonon coupling. The EPZPbBr4 X&#8208;ray detector exhibits specific detectivity of 1.23 &#215; 108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2.








Abstract
2D &lt;100&gt;&#8208;oriented Dion&#8211;Jacobson or Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are widely recognized as promising candidates for optoelectronic applications. However, the large interlayer spacing significantly hinders the carrier transport. &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskites naturally exhibit reduced interlayer spacings, but the tilting of metal halide octahedra is typically serious and leads to poor charge transport. Herein, a &lt;110&gt;&#8208;oriented 2D perovskite EPZPbBr4 (EPZ = 1&#8208;ethylpiperazine) with minimized tilting is designed through A&#8208;site stereo&#8208;hindrance engineering. The piperazine functional group enters the space enclosed by the three [PbBr6]4&#8722; octahedra, pushing Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb closer to a straight line (maximum Pb&#9472;Br&#9472;Pb angle &#8776;180&#176;), suppressing the tilting as well as electron&#8211;phonon coupling. Meanwhile, the ethyl group is located between layers and contributes an extremely reduced effective interlayer distance (2.22 &#197;), further facilitating the carrier transport. As a result, EPZPbBr4 simultaneously demonstrates high &#181;&#964; product (1.8 &#215; 10&#8722;3 cm2 V&#8722;1) and large resistivity (2.17 &#215; 1010 &#937; cm). The assembled X&#8208;ray detector achieves low dark current of 1.02 &#215; 10&#8722;10 A cm&#8722;2 and high sensitivity of 1240 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under the same bias voltage. The realized specific detectivity (ratio of sensitivity to noise current density, 1.23 &#215; 108 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1 A&#8722;1/2) is the highest among all reported perovskite X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Femtosecond Electron Diffraction Reveals Local Disorder and Local Anharmonicity in Thermoelectric SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and TDDFT&#8208;MD simulations, the local disorder and local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively, indicating a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel. The use of femtosecond electron diffraction is demonstrated to detect nonequilibrium structural dynamics in crystalline&#8208;disordered materials and reveal the intrinsic local disorder and local anharmonicity with femtosecond&#8208;picometer temporospatial resolution.








Abstract
In addition to long&#8208;range periodicity, local disorder, with local structures deviating from the average lattice structure, dominates the physical properties of phonons, electrons, and spin subsystems in crystalline functional materials. Experimentally characterizing the 3D atomic configuration of such a local disorder and correlating it with advanced functions remains challenging. Using a combination of femtosecond electron diffraction, structure factor calculations, and time&#8208;dependent density functional theory molecular dynamics simulations, the static local disorder and its local anharmonicity in thermoelectric SnSe are identified exclusively. The ultrafast structural dynamics reveal that the crystalline SnSe is composed of multiple locally correlated configurations dominated by the static off&#8208;symmetry displacements of Sn (&#8776;0.4 &#197;) and such a set of locally correlated structures is termed local disorder. Moreover, the anharmonicity of this local disorder induces an ultrafast atomic displacement within 100 fs, indicating the signature of probable THz Einstein oscillators. The identified local disorder and local anharmonicity suggest a glass&#8208;like thermal transport channel, which updates the fundamental insight into the long&#8208;debated ultralow thermal conductivity of SnSe. The method of revealing the 3D local disorder and the locally correlated interactions by ultrafast structural dynamics will inspire broad interest in the construction of structure&#8211;property relationships in material science.

         <title>Rational Design of Multinary Metal Chalcogenide Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 Nanocrystals for Efficient Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The realization of high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;lifetime potassium&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge due to the significant volume expansion and sluggish kinetics of anode materials for large&#8208;sized K&#8208;ion storage. In this study, a ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene composite is designed with exceptional electronic/ionic conductivity, limited volume changes, enabling high K&#8208;storage capacity, ultrafast and highly durable potassium storage.








Abstract
Multinary metal chalcogenides hold considerable promise for high&#8208;energy potassium storage due to their numerous redox reactions. However, challenges arise from issues such as volume expansion and sluggish kinetics. Here, a design featuring a layered ternary Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 anchored on graphene layers as a composite anode, where Bi atoms act as a lattice softening agent on Sb, is presented. Benefiting from the lattice arrangement in Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 and structure, Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene exhibits a mitigated expansion of 28% during the potassiation/depotassiation process and demonstrates facile K+ ion transfer kinetics, enabling long&#8208;term durability of 500 cycles at various high rates. Operando synchrotron diffraction patterns and spectroscopies including in situ Raman, ex situ adsorption, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron reveal multiple conversion and alloying/dealloying reactions for potassium storage at the atomic level. In addition, both theoretical calculations and electrochemical examinations elucidate the K+ migration pathways and indicate a reduction in energy barriers within Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3/graphene, thereby suggesting enhanced diffusion kinetics for K+. These findings provide insight in the design of durable high&#8208;energy multinary tellurides for potassium storage.

         <title>Touchless Thermosensation Enabled by Flexible Infrared Photothermoelectric Detector for Temperature Prewarning Function of Electronic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To realize the touchless thermosensation function of e&#8208;skin, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is developed, based on the photothermoelectric coupling of tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate, which exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation from hot and cold stimuli. Moreover, the integration of wearable infrared detector with a soft robotic gripper for temperature prewarning is demonstrated.








Abstract
Artificial skin, endowed with the capability to perceive thermal stimuli without physical contact, will bring innovative interactive experiences into smart robotics and augmented reality. The implementation of touchless thermosensation, responding to both hot and cold stimuli, relies on the construction of a flexible infrared detector operating in the long&#8208;wavelength infrared range to capture the spontaneous thermal radiation. This imposes rigorous requirements on the photodetection performance and mechanical flexibility of the detector. Herein, a flexible and wearable infrared detector is presented, on basis of the photothermoelectric coupling of the tellurium&#8208;based thermoelectric multilayer film and the infrared&#8208;absorbing polyimide substrate. By suppressing the optical reflection loss and aligning the destructive interference position with the absorption peak of polyimide, the fabricated thermopile detector exhibits high sensitivity to the thermal radiation over a broad source temperature range from &#8722;50 to 110&#160;&#176;C, even capable of resolving 0.05&#160;&#176;C temperature change. Spatially resolved radiation distribution sensing is also achieved by constructing an integrated thermopile array. Furthermore, an established temperature prewarning system is demonstrated for soft robotic gripper, enabling the identification of noxious thermal stimuli in a contactless manner. A feasible strategy is offered here to integrate the infrared detection technique into the sensory modality of electronic skin.

         <title>Photoactivation Inducing Multifunctional Coupling of Fluorophore for Efficient Tumor Therapy In Situ</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable sensor for in situ formation of near infrared fluorochrome is reported. Importantly, the photoactivation process involves the generation of superoxide anion radicals, which is highly promising for photodynamic therapy. Besides, the photochemically generated product possess ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%. Importantly, BI and Cy&#9472;BI are identified as efficient CHK1 inhibitor.








Abstract
Photoactivatable molecules, with high&#8208;precision spatialtemporal control, have largely promoted bioimaging and phototherapy applications of fluorescent dyes. Here, the first photoactivatable sensor (BI) is described that can be triggered by broad excitation light (405&#8211;660 nm), which further undergoes intersystem crossing and H&#8208;atom transfer processes to forming superoxide anion radicals (O2&#8722;&#8226;) and carbon radicals. Particularly, the photoinduced gain of carbon&#8208;centered radicals (BI&#8226;) allows for radical&#8208;radical coupling to afford the combined crosslink product (BI&#9472;BI), which would be oxidized in the presence of O2&#8722;&#8226; to produce an extended conjugate system with near infrared emission (820 nm). Besides, the photochemically generated product (Cy&#9472;BI) possesses ultra&#8208;high photothermal conversion efficiency up to 90.9%, which optimized phototherapy potential. What&#8242;s more, Western Blot assay reveals that both BI and the photoproduct Cy&#9472;BI can efficiently inhibit the expression of CHK1, and the irradiation of BI and Cy&#9472;BI further induces apoptosis and ultimately enhances the phototherapeutic effects. Thus, the combination of cell cycle block inducing apoptosis, photodynamic therapy and photothermal therapy treatments significantly suppress solid tumor in vivo antitumor efficacy explorations. This is a novel finding in developing photoactivatable molecules, as well as the broad applicability of photoimaging and phototherapy in tumor&#8208;related areas.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Interfacial Confined Assembly of Colloidal Quantum Dots Quasisuperlattice Microcavities for High&#8208;Resolution Full&#8208;Color Microlaser Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;interfacial confined assembly method is developed for the long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered assembly of quasisuperlattice CQD microstructure arrays by controlling dewetting dynamics. CQD microring arrays exhibit high&#8208;Q laser resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable laser emission modes. Surface treatment and liquid dynamics control enable on&#8208;chip integration of multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are considered a promising material for the next generation of integrated display devices due to their designable optical bandgap and low energy consumption. Owing to their dispersibility in solvents, CQD micro/nanostructures are generally fabricated by solution&#8208;processing methods.

&lt;p&gt;A multi-interfacial confined assembly method is developed for the long-range-ordered assembly of quasisuperlattice CQD microstructure arrays by controlling dewetting dynamics. CQD microring arrays exhibit high-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt; laser resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable laser emission modes. Surface treatment and liquid dynamics control enable on-chip integration of multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are considered a promising material for the next generation of integrated display devices due to their designable optical bandgap and low energy consumption. Owing to their dispersibility in solvents, CQD micro/nanostructures are generally fabricated by solution-processing methods. However, the random mass transfer in liquid restricts the programmable construction in macroscopy and ordered assembly in microscopy for the integration of CQD optical structures. Herein, a multi-interfacial confined assembly strategy is developed to fabricate CQDs programmable microstructure arrays with a quasisuperlattice configuration through controlling the dynamics of three-phase contact lines (TPCLs). The motion of TPCLs dominates the division of liquid film for precise positioning of CQD microstructures, while pinned TPCLs control the solvent evaporation and concentration gradient to directionally drive the mass transfer and packing of CQDs. Owing to their long-range order and adjustable structural dimensions, CQD microring arrays function as high-quality-factor (high-&lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;) lasing resonant cavities with low thresholds and tunable lasing emission modes. Through the further surface treatment and liquid dynamics control, the on-chip integration of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) multicomponent CQD microlaser arrays are demonstrated. The technique establishes a new route to fabricate large-area, ultrahigh-definition, and full-color CQD laser displays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into Multiple Intermolecular Coordination of Composite Solid Electrolytes via Cryo&#8208;Electron Microscopy for High&#8208;Voltage All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a simple and effective composite solid electrolyte with multiple coordination to stabilize high&#8208;voltage lithium metal batteries is discovered, and the interface formation mechanism is visualized using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. The multiple coordination prevents the continuous decomposition of the polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites and establishing stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through the preferential decomposition of anions, thereby ensuring the long&#8208;term cycling stability of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Polymer/ceramic&#8208;based composite solid electrolytes (CSE) are promising candidates for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SLBs), benefiting from the combined mechanical robustness of polymeric electrolytes and the high ionic conductivity of ceramic electrolytes. However, the interfacial instability and poorly understood interphases of CSE hinder their application in high&#8208;voltage SLBs. Herein, a simple but effective CSE that stabilizes high&#8208;voltage SLBs by forming multiple intermolecular coordination interactions between polyester and ceramic electrolytes is discovered. The multiple coordination between the carbonyl groups in poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) and the fluorosulfonyl groups in anions with Li6.5La3Zr1.5Ta0.5O12 nanoparticles is directly visualized by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation. Importantly, the multiple coordination in CSE not only prevents the continuous decomposition of polymer skeleton by shielding the vulnerable carbonyl sites but also establishes stable inorganic&#8208;rich interphases through preferential decomposition of anions. The stable CSE and its inorganic&#8208;rich interphases enable Li||Li symmetric cells with an exceptional lifespan of over 4800 h without dendritic shorting at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the high&#8208;voltage SLB with LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathode displays excellent cycling stability over 1100 cycles at a 1C charge/discharge rate. This work reveals the underlying mechanism behind the excellent stability of coordinating composite electrolytes and interfaces in high&#8208;voltage SLBs.

         <title>Stable and High&#8208;performance Flow H2&#8208;O2 Fuel Cells with Coupled Acidic Oxygen Reduction and Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conceptually new, coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by integrating acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction is developed, leading to a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage of 2.057&#160;V. More specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode demonstrates a high electricity output and excellent durability, far superior to the conventional fuel cells.








Abstract
Conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells suffer from the low output voltage, insufficient durability, and high&#8208;cost catalysts (e.g., noble metals). Herein, this work reports a conceptually new coupled flow fuel cell (CF&#8208;FC) by coupling asymmetric electrolytes for acidic oxygen reduction reaction and alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction. By introducing an electrochemical neutralization energy, the newly&#8208;developed CF&#8208;FCs possess a significantly increased theoretical open&#8208;circuit voltage. Specifically, a CF&#8208;FC based on a typical transition metal single&#8208;atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C cathode catalyst demonstrates a high electricity output up to 1.81&#160;V and durability with an ultrahigh retention of 91% over 110&#160;h, far superior to the conventional fuel cells (usually, &lt; 1.0&#160;V, &lt; 50% retention over 20&#160;h). The output performance can even be significantly enhanced easily by connecting multiple CF&#8208;FCs into the parallel, series, or combined parallel&#8208;series connections at a fractional cost of that for the conventional H2&#8208;O2 fuel cells, showing great potential for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Thus, this study provides a platform to transform conventional fuel cell technology through the rational design and development of advanced energy conversion and storage devices by coupling different electrocatalytic reactions.

The co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit markedly improved stability and facilitate prolonged, sustained drug release following minimally invasive subconjunctival administration, so as to successfully mitigate the progression of age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) by harnessing a synergistic combination of anti&#8208;angiogenesis, anti&#8208;oxidative stress, anti&#8208;fibrosis and anti&#8208;inflammation actions.








Abstract
Age&#8208;related macular degeneration (AMD) disease has become a worldwide senile disease, and frequent intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) is the mainstream treatment in the clinic, which is associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. Herein, nintedanib, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, and lutein, a potent antioxidant, can co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles through multiple noncovalent interactions. Interestingly, the co&#8208;assembled lutein/nintedanib nanoparticles (L/N NPs) exhibit significantly improved stability and achieve long&#8208;term sustained release of two drugs for at least two months in mice. Interestingly, in rabbit eyeball with a more complete barrier system, the L/N NPs still successfully distribute in the retina and choroid for a month. In the laser&#8208;induced mouse choroidal neovascularization model, the L/N NPs after a minimally invasive subconjunctival administration can successfully inhibit angiogenesis and achieve comparable and even better therapeutic results to that of standard intravitreal injection of anti&#8208;VEGF. Therefore, the subconjunctival injection of L/N NPs with long&#8208;term sustained drug release behavior represents a promising and innovative strategy for AMD treatment. Such minimally invasive administration together with the ability to effectively inhibit angiogenesis reduce inflammation and counteract oxidative stress and holds great potential for improving patient outcomes and quality of life in those suffering from this debilitating eye condition.

         <title>PROTAC Prodrug&#8208;Integrated Nanosensitizer for Potentiating Radiation Therapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dual&#8208;loaded nanosensitizer, featuring PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) prodrug and HfO2 nanoparticles, is engineered to sensitize radiotherapy in head and neck cancer by amplifying DNA damage and inactivating RAD51&#8208;associated protein 1 through bromodomain protein 4 degradation. 








Abstract
Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary options for clinical cancer therapy, in particular advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Herein, the crucial role of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4)&#8208;RAD51 associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) axis in sensitizing RT of HNSCC is revealed. A versatile nanosensitizer (RPB7H) is thus innovatively engineered by integrating a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) prodrug (BPA771) and hafnium dioxide (HfO2) nanoparticles to downregulate BRD4&#8208;RAD51AP1 pathway and sensitize HNSCC tumor to RT. Upon intravenous administration, the RPB7H nanoparticles selectively accumulate at the tumor tissue and internalize into tumor cells by recognizing neuropilin&#8208;1 overexpressed in the tumor mass. HfO2 nanoparticles enhance RT effectiveness by amplifying X&#8208;ray deposition, intensifying DNA damage, and boosting oxidative stress.

&lt;p&gt;The dual-loaded nanosensitizer, featuring PROTAC (PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras) prodrug and HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles, is engineered to sensitize radiotherapy in head and neck cancer by amplifying DNA damage and inactivating RAD51-associated protein 1 through bromodomain protein 4 degradation. 

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the primary options for clinical cancer therapy, in particular advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Herein, the crucial role of bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4)-RAD51 associated protein 1 (RAD51AP1) axis in sensitizing RT of HNSCC is revealed. A versatile nanosensitizer (RPB7H) is thus innovatively engineered by integrating a PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) prodrug (BPA771) and hafnium dioxide (HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles to downregulate BRD4-RAD51AP1 pathway and sensitize HNSCC tumor to RT. Upon intravenous administration, the RPB7H nanoparticles selectively accumulate at the tumor tissue and internalize into tumor cells by recognizing neuropilin-1 overexpressed in the tumor mass. HfO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles enhance RT effectiveness by amplifying X-ray deposition, intensifying DNA damage, and boosting oxidative stress. Meanwhile, BPA771 can be activated by RT-induced H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion to degrade BRD4 and inactivate RAD51AP1, thus impeding RT-induced DNA damage repair. This versatile nanosensitizer, combined with X-ray irradiation, effectively regresses HNSCC tumor growth in a mouse model. The findings introduce a PROTAC prodrug-based radiosensitization strategy by targeting the BRD4-RAD51AP1 axis, may offer a promising avenue to augment RT and more effective HNSCC therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Gradiently Foaming Ultrasoft Hydrogel with Stop Holes for Highly Deformable, Crack&#8208;Resistant and Sensitive Conformal Human&#8208;Machine Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the challenges of simultaneously achieving ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness, and high sensitivity for wearable sensing applications, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels with stop holes as ultrasoft, high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance, and sensitive conformal HMIs for remote disease diagnosis and smart aquaculture.








Abstract
Hydrogels are considered as promising materials for human&#8208;machine interfaces (HMIs) owing to their merits of tailorable mechanical and electrical properties; nevertheless, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve ultrasoftness, good mechanical robustness and high sensitivity, which are the pre&#8208;requisite requirements for wearable sensing applications. Herein, for the first time, this work proposes a universal phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced bubbling strategy to fabricate ultrasoft gradient foam&#8208;shaped hydrogels (FSHs) with stop holes for high deformability, crack&#8208;resistance and sensitive conformal HMIs. As a typical system, the FSH based on polyacrylamide/sodium alginate system shows an ultralow Young's modulus (1.68&#160;kPa), increased sustainable strain (1411%), enhanced fracture toughness (915.6 J&#160;m&#8722;2), improved tensile sensitivity (21.77), and compressive sensitivity (65.23 kPa&#8722;1). The FSHs are used for precisely acquiring and identifying gesture commands of the operator to remotely control a surgical robot for endoscopy and an electric ship in a first&#8208;person perspective for cruising, feeding crabs and monitoring the environmental change in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Viscoelasticity&#8208;Controlled Relaxation in Wrinkling Surface for Multistage Time&#8208;Resolved Optical Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; wrinkling system with controllable polymer interaction networks. By regulating the viscoelasticity of polymer interaction networks, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. Consequently, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved, which can be further utilized to develop a practical encryption label.








Abstract
As counterfeit techniques continue to evolve, ensuring the security of conventional &#8220;static&#8221; encryption methods becomes increasingly challenging. Here, the viscoelasticity&#8208;controlled relaxation is introduced for the first time in a bilayer wrinkling system by regulating the density of hydrogen bond networks in polymer to construct a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; encryption material. The wrinkling surface can manipulate light during the dynamic relaxation process, exhibiting three stages with frosted glass, structural color, and mirror reflection. By regulating the viscoelasticity of skin layer through UV irradiation, the wavelength and the relaxation rate of the wrinkles can be controlled. As a result, dynamic wrinkling anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns and time&#8208;resolved multistage information encryption are achieved. Crucially, the encryption material is developed as an anti&#8208;counterfeiting label for packing boxes in daily applications, allowing the encrypted information to be activated manually and identified by naked eyes, surpassing the existing time&#8208;resolved encryption materials in utilization potential. Besides, the dynamic hydrogen bond networks are extended to various dynamic interaction networks, demonstrating the versatility of the dynamic encryption strategy. This work not only provides an additional dimension for dynamic information encryption in daily practical use, but also offers theoretical guidance for the development of advanced optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and smart display materials in the future.

         <title>Dynamically Reconstructed Triple&#8208;Copper&#8208;Vacancy Associates Confined in Cu Nanowires Enabling High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electroreduction to C2+ Products</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates are first constructed through electroreduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, demonstrated by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations disclose the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which favor *CO adsorption and dimerization.








Abstract
Electrochemically reconstructed Cu&#8208;based catalysts always exhibit enhanced CO2&#160;electroreduction performance; however, it still remains ambiguous whether the reconstructed Cu vacancies have a substantial impact on CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ reactivity. Herein, Cu vacancies are first constructed through electrochemical reduction of Cu&#8208;based nanowires, in which high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy image manifests the formation of triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates with different concentrations, confirmed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy. In situ attenuated total reflection&#8208;surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy discloses the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates favor *CO adsorption and fast *CO dimerization. Moreover, density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations unravel the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates endow the nearby Cu sites with enriched and disparate local charge density, which enhances the *CO adsorption and reduces the CO&#8211;CO coupling barrier, affirmed by the decreased *CO dimerization energy barrier by 0.4&#160;eV. As a result, the triple&#8208;copper&#8208;vacancy associates confined in Cu nanowires achieve a high Faradaic efficiency of over 80% for C2+ products in a wide current density range of 400&#8211;800&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming most reported Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>The Electron Migration Polarization Boosting Electromagnetic Wave Absorption Based on Ce Atoms Modulated yolk@shell FexN@NGC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs system is constructed to demonstrate the electron migration mechanism, where the Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) with +3 valence state can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles through conductive network under EMW. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance.








Abstract
The electron migration polarization is considered as a promising approach to optimize electromagnetic waves (EMW) dissipation. However, it is still difficult to realize well&#8208;controlled electron migration and elucidate the related EMW loss mechanisms for current researches. Herein, a novel FexN@NGC/Ce system to construct an effective electron migration model based on the electron leaps among the 4f/5d/6s orbitals of Ce ions is explored. In Fe4N@NGC/CeSA+Cs+NPs, Ce single&#8208;atoms (SA) mainly represent a +3 valence state, which can feed the electrons to Ce4+ of clusters (Cs) and CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) through a conductive network under EMW, leading to the electron migration polarization. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe4N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance with a minimum reflection loss exceeds &#8722;85.1&#160;dB and a broadened absorption bandwidth up to 7.5&#160;GHz at 1.5&#160;mm. This study clarifies the in&#8208;depth relationship between electron migration polarization and EMW dissipation, providing profound insights into developing well&#8208;coordinated magnetic&#8211;dielectric nanocomposites for EMW absorption engineering.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;N@NGC/Ce system to construct an effective electron migration model based on the electron leaps among the 4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;/5&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;/6&lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; orbitals of Ce ions is explored. In Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N@NGC/Ce&lt;sub&gt;SA+Cs+NPs&lt;/sub&gt;, Ce single-atoms (SA) mainly represent a +3 valence state, which can feed the electrons to Ce&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; of clusters (Cs) and CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles (NPs) through a conductive network under EMW, leading to the electron migration polarization. Such electron migration loss combined with excellent magnetic loss provided by Fe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;N core, results in the optimal EMW attenuation performance with a minimum reflection loss exceeds &#8722;85.1&#160;dB and a broadened absorption bandwidth up to 7.5&#160;GHz at 1.5&#160;mm. This study clarifies the in-depth relationship between electron migration polarization and EMW dissipation, providing profound insights into developing well-coordinated magnetic&#8211;dielectric nanocomposites for EMW absorption engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Safety Electrolytes with an Anion&#8208;Rich Solvation Structure Tuned by Difluorinated Cations for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel medium concentration electrolyte is designed based on the gem&#8208;difluorinated ionic liquid with ultrahigh safety, high voltage stability, high temperature stability, and excellent Ni&#8208;rich cathode compatibility.








Abstract
As next&#8208;generation energy storage devices, lithium metal batteries (LMBs) must offer high safety, high&#8208;voltage resistance, and a long life span. Electrolyte engineering is a facile strategy to tailor the interfacial chemistry of LMBs. In particular, the solvation structure and derived solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) are crucial for a satisfactory battery performance. Herein, a novel middle&#8208;concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (MCILE) with an anion&#8208;rich solvation structure tuned by difluorinated cations is demonstrated to achieve ultrahigh safety, high&#8208;voltage stability, and excellent ternary&#8208;cathode compatibility. Novel gem&#8208;difluorinated cations first synthesized for prestoring fluorine on positively charged species, not only preferentially adsorb in the inner&#8208;Helmholtz layers, but also participate in regulating the Li+ solvation structure, resulting in a robust interphase. Moreover, these weak interactions in the Li+ solvation structure including anion&#8211;solvent and ionic liquid (IL) cation&#8211;solvent pairs are first revealed, which are beneficial for promoting an anion&#8208;dominated solvation structure and the desolvation process. Benefiting from the unique anion&#8208;rich solvation structure, a stable hetero&#8208;SEI structure is obtained. The designed MCILE exhibits compatibility with Li metal anode and the high&#8208;voltage ternary cathode at high temperatures (60&#160;&#176;C). This work provides a new approach for regulating the solvation structure and electrode interphase chemistry of LMBs via difluorinated IL cations.

         <title>Gradient Pores Enhance Charge Storage Density of Carbonaceous Cathodes for Zn&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge density of Zn&#8208;ion capacitor (ZIC)&#160;is significantly enhanced by deploying an activated meso&#8208;microporous shell&#160;carbon (MMSC&#8208;A) nanofibers. The tailored pore size and gradient&#8208;pore structure endow the nanofibers with unusual charge storage mechanism, as elucidated by multiple in situ means.








Abstract
Engineering carbonaceous cathode materials with adequately accessible active sites is crucial for unleashing their charge storage potential. Herein, activated meso&#8208;microporous shell carbon (MMSC&#8208;A)&#160;nanofibers are constructed to enhance the zinc ion storage density by forming a gradient&#8208;pore structure. A dominating pore size of 0.86&#160;nm is tailored to cater for the solvated [Zn(H2O)6]2+. Moreover, these gradient porous nanofibers feature rapid ion/electron dual conduction pathways and offer abundant active surfaces with high affinity to electrolyte. When employed in Zn&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs), the electrode delivers significantly enhanced capacity (257 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (200&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 78&#160;W kg&#8722;1), and cyclic stability (95% retention after 10&#160;000 cycles) compared to nonactivated carbon nanofibers electrode. A series of in situ characterization techniques unveil that the improved Zn2+ storage capability stems from size compatibility between the pores and [Zn(H2O)6]2+, the co&#8208;adsorption of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722;, as well as reversible surface chemical interaction. This work presents an effective method to engineering meso&#8208;microporous carbon materials toward high energy&#8208;density storage, and also offers insights into the Zn2+ storage mechanism in such gradient&#8208;pore structures.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Reinforced Solvating Ionic Liquid Electrolytes Enabling Stable High&#8208;Nickel Cathode in Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ionic liquid electrolyte is developed to enhance the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promote more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+. This new type of ionic liquid electrolyte improves Li+ transport ability and stabilizes the interface between the electrolyte and high&#8208;nickel cathode, rendering the practical application toward high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Ionic liquid electrolytes (ILEs) are promising to develop high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Unfortunately, ILEs normally face the challenge of sluggish Li+ transport due to increased ions&#8217; clustering caused by Coulombic interactions. Here a type of anion&#8208;reinforced solvating ILEs (ASILEs) is discovered, which reduce ions&#8217; clustering by enhancing the anion&#8211;cation coordination and promoting more anions to enter the internal solvation sheath of Li+ to address this concern. The designed ASILEs, incorporating chlorinated hydrocarbons and two anions, bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide (FSI&#8722;) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (TFSI&#8722;), aim to enhance Li+ transport ability, stabilize the interface of the high&#8208;nickel cathode material (LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2, NCM811), and retain fire&#8208;retardant properties. With these ASILEs, the Li/NCM811 cell exhibits high initial specific capacity (203 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C), outstanding capacity retention (81.6% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C), and excellent average Coulombic efficiency (99.9% over 500 cycles at 1.0 C). Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level Li/NCM811 pouch cell achieves a notable energy density of 386&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, indicating the practical feasibility of this electrolyte. This research offers a practical solution and fundamental guidance for the rational design of advanced ILEs, enabling the development of high&#8208;safety and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LMBs.

         <title>A 2D Cryptographic Hash Function Incorporating Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Digital Signatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A complete hardware&#8208;based and secure user authentication scheme using public key cryptography with integrated circuits constructed using monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is demonstrated. A key highlight of this study involves exploiting the unique properties of homomorphic encryption where computations are performed on the encrypted data while preserving the integrity of the underlying information.








Abstract
User authentication is a critical aspect of any information exchange system&#160;which verifies the identities of individuals seeking access to sensitive information. Conventionally, this approachrelies on establishing robust digital signature protocols&#160;which employ asymmetric encryption techniques involving a key pair consisting of a public key and its matching private key. In this article, a user verification platform constructed using integrated circuits (ICs) with atomically thin two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) memtransistors is presented. First, generation of secure cryptographic keys is demonstrated by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of carrier trapping and detrapping at the 2D/oxide interface trap sites. Subsequently, the ability to manipulate the functionality of logical NOR is leveraged to create a secure one&#8208;way hash function which when homomorphically operated upon with NAND, XOR, OR, NOT, and AND logic circuits generate distinct digital signatures. These signatures when subsequently decrypted, verify the authenticity of the receiver while ensuring complete preservation of data integrity and confidentiality as the underlying information is never revealed. Finally, the advantages of implementing a NOR&#8208;based hashing techniques in comparison to the conventional XOR&#8208;based encryption method are established. This demonstration highlights the potential of 2D&#8208;based ICs in developing critical hardware information security primitives.

&lt;p&gt;User authentication is a critical aspect of any information exchange system&#160;which verifies the identities of individuals seeking access to sensitive information. Conventionally, this approachrelies on establishing robust digital signature protocols&#160;which employ asymmetric encryption techniques involving a key pair consisting of a public key and its matching private key. In this article, a user verification platform constructed using integrated circuits (ICs) with atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) memtransistors is presented. First, generation of secure cryptographic keys is demonstrated by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of carrier trapping and detrapping at the 2D/oxide interface trap sites. Subsequently, the ability to manipulate the functionality of logical NOR is leveraged to create a secure one-way hash function which when homomorphically operated upon with NAND, XOR, OR, NOT, and AND logic circuits generate distinct digital signatures. These signatures when subsequently decrypted, verify the authenticity of the receiver while ensuring complete preservation of data integrity and confidentiality as the underlying information is never revealed. Finally, the advantages of implementing a NOR-based hashing techniques in comparison to the conventional XOR-based encryption method are established. This demonstration highlights the potential of 2D-based ICs in developing critical hardware information security primitives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain Regulation of Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites Enables High&#8208;Performance Wide&#8208;Bandgap Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rb+ fills the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the MA volatilization, relieving shrinkage strain of perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion increases the halide migration barrier, resulting a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite phase, and suppressing nonradiative recombination. As a result, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cell exhibits an improved power conversion efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap mixed&#8208;halogen perovskite materials are widely used as top cells in tandem solar cells. However, serious open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss restricts the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, it is shown that the resulting methylammonium vacancies induce lattice distortion in methylammonium chloride&#8208;assisted perovskite film, resulting in an inhomogeneous halogen distribution and low Voc. Thus, a lattice strain regulation strategy is reported to fabricate high&#8208;performance wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs. Rubidium (Rb) cations are introduced to fill the A&#8208;site vacancy caused by the methylammonium volatilization, which alleviates shrinkage strain of the perovskite crystal. The reduced lattice distortion and increased halide ion migration barrier result in a homogeneous mixed&#8208;halide perovskite film. Due to improved carrier transport and suppressed nonradiative recombination, the Rb&#8208;treated wide&#8208;bandgap PSC (1.68&#160;eV) achieves an excellent PCE of 21.72%, accompanied by a high Voc of 1.22&#160;V. The resulting device maintains more than 90% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun illumination conditions.

         <title>Mechanically Interlocked Interphase with Energy Dissipation and Fast Li&#8208;Ion Transport for High&#8208;Capacity Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The [an]daisy chain (DC)&#8208;based mechanically interlocked network (DCMIN) is used as the artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) for stabilizing the lithium metal anode. The synergistic contractile and large&#8208;amplitude molecular motion of the [an]DC enable the DCMIN not only an effective energy dissipation function but also a fast Li&#8208;ion transport behavior, thus realizing a stable 2800&#160;h of Li&#8208;symmetrical cycling.








Abstract
Constructing an artificial solid electrolyte interphase (ASEI) on Li metal anodes (LMAs) is a potential strategy for addressing the dendrite issues. However, the mechanical fatigue of the ASEI caused by stress accumulation under the repeated deformation from the Li plating/stripping is not taken seriously. Herein, this work introduces a mechanically interlocked [an]daisy chain network (DCMIN) into the ASEI to stabilize the Li metal/ASEI interface by combining the functions of energy dissipation and fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The DCMIN featured by large&#8208;range molecular motions is cross&#8208;linked via efficient thiol&#8208;ene click chemistry; thus, the DCMIN has flexibility and excellent mechanical properties. As an ASEI, the crown ether units in DCMIN not only interact with the dialkylammonium of a flexible chain, forming the energy dissipation behavior but also coordinate with Li ion to support the fast Li&#8208;ion transport in DCMIN. Therefore, a stable 2800&#160;h&#8208;symmetrical cycling (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and an excellent 5 C&#8208;rate (full cell with LiFePO4) performance are achieved by DCMIN&#8208;based ASEI. Furthermore, the 1&#8208;Ah pouch cell (LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2 cathode) with DCMIN&#8208;coated LMA exhibits improved capacity retention (88%) relative to the Control. The molecular design of DCMIN provides new insights into the optimization of an ASEI for high&#8208;energy LMAs.

         <title>Symmetry Breaking Induced Amorphization of Cobalt&#8208;Based Catalyst for Boosted CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide with optimized band structure and catalytic energetics is&#160;theoretically proposed and successfully prepared in an amorphous state. The Se,O co&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets are capable of photocatalyzing CO2 to CO with satisfactory activity and selectivity, superior to other Co&#8208;based catalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to energy carriers is intriguing in the industry but kinetically hard to fulfil due to the lack of rationally designed catalysts. A promising way to improve the efficiency and selectivity of such reduction is to break the structural symmetry of catalysts by manipulating coordination. Here, inspired by analogous CoO6 and CoSe6 octahedral structural motifs of the Co(OH)2 and CoSe, a hetero&#8208;anionic coordination strategy is proposed to construct a symmetry&#8208;breaking photocatalyst prototype of oxygen&#8208;deficient Se&#8208;doped cobalt hydroxide upon first&#8208;principles calculations. Such involvement of large&#8208;size Se atoms in CoO6 octahedral frameworks experimentally lead to the switching of semiconductor type of cobalt hydroxide from p to n, generation of oxygen defects, and amorphization. The resultant oxygen&#8208;deficient Se,O&#8208;coordinated Co&#8208;based amorphous nanosheets exhibit impressive photocatalytic performance of CO2 to CO with a generation rate of 60.7&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in the absence of photosensitizer and scavenger, superior to most of the Co&#8208;based photocatalysts. This work establishes a correlation between the symmetry&#8208;breaking of catalytic sites and CO2 photoreduction performances, opening up a new paradigm in the design of amorphous photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

         <title>Printable Block Molecular Assemblies with Controlled Exciton Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a series of molecular heterostructure is successfully fabricated, with precise control over exciton dynamics in each block (including singlet and triplet excitons featuring ns, &#181;s, and ms emission lifetimes). Moreover, these heterostructures are printable and can be accurately positioned using a Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, leading to programable patterns.








Abstract
Creating hierarchical molecular block heterostructures, with the control over size, shape, optical, and electronic properties of each nanostructured building block can help develop functional applications, such as information storage, nanowire spectrometry, and photonic computing. However, achieving precise control over the position of molecular assemblies, and the dynamics of excitons in each block, remains a challenge. In the present work, the first fabrication of molecular heterostructures with the control of exciton dynamics in each block, is demonstrated. Additionally, these heterostructures are printable and can be precisely positioned using Direct Ink Writing&#8208;based (DIW) 3D printing technique, resulting in programable patterns. Singlet excitons with emission lifetimes on nanosecond or microsecond timescales and triplet excitons with emission lifetimes on millisecond timescales appear simultaneously in different building blocks, with an efficient energy transfer process in the heterojunction. These organic materials also exhibit stimuli&#8208;responsive emission by changing the power or wavelength of the excitation laser. Potential applications of these organic heterostructures in integrated photonics, where the versatility of fluorescence, phosphorescence, efficient energy transfer, printability, and stimulus sensitivity co&#8208;exist in a single nanowire, are foreseen.

         <title>Customized Enhancement of Thermal Sensitivity of Tumors at Different Subcutaneous Depths by Multichannel Lanthanide Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a polyoxometalate&#8208;encapsulated hydrophilic multichannel lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobe, the depth of a tumor can be evaluated through fluorescence imaging. The probe enables tunable release of a heat shock protein inhibitor to enhance thermal sensitivity of tumors for customized photothermal therapy. An optimized nonuniform light field enables efficient ablation of tumors at different subcutaneous depths while minimizing injury to surrounding tissues.








Abstract
The photothermal therapeutic effect on tumors located at different subcutaneous depths varies due to the attenuation of light by tissue. Here, based on the wavelength&#8208;dependent optical attenuation properties of tissues, the tumor depth is assessed using a multichannel lanthanide nanocomposite. A zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;8)&#8208;coated nanocomposite is able to deliver high amounts of the hydrophilic heat shock protein 90 inhibitor epigallocatechin gallate through a hydrogen&#8208;bonding network formed by the encapsulated highly polarized polyoxometalate guest. It is superior to both bare and PEGylated ZIF&#8208;8 for drug delivery. With the assessment of tumor depth and accumulated amount of nanocomposite by fluorescence, an irradiation prescription can be customized to release sufficient HSP90 inhibitor and generate heat for sensitized photothermal treatment of tumors, which not only ensured therapeutic efficacy but also minimized damage to the surrounding tissues.

         <title>Corrosion Engineering of Part&#8208;Per&#8208;Million Single Atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 Electrocatalyst for PET Upcycling at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading is designed for the highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen. This process allows the valuable chemicals production at the ampere&#8208;level current density with high efficiency and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET).








Abstract
The plastic waste issue has posed a series of formidable challenges for the ecological environment and human health. While conventional recycling strategies often lead to plastic down&#8208;cycling, the electrochemical strategy of recovering valuable monomers enables an ideal, circular plastic economy. Here a corrosion synthesized single atom Pt1/Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst with part&#8208;per&#8208;million noble Pt loading for highly efficient and selective upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into valuable chemicals (potassium diformate and terephthalic acid) and green hydrogen is reported. Electro&#8208;oxidation of PET hydrolysate, ethylene glycol (EG), to formate is processed with high Faraday efficiency (FE) and selectivity (&gt;90%) at the current density close to 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (1.444&#160;V vs RHE). The in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations provide insights into the mechanism and the understanding of the high efficiency. Remarkably, the electro&#8208;oxidation of EG at the ampere&#8208;level current density is also successfully illustrated by using a membrane&#8208;electrode assembly with high FEs to formate integrated with hydrogen production for 500&#160;h of continuous operation. This process allows valuable chemical production at high space&#8208;time yield and is highly profitable (588&#8211;700&#160;$&#160;ton&#8722;1 PET), showing an industrial perspective on single&#8208;atom catalysis of electrochemical plastic upcycling.

         <title>Reversible Mechanical Contraception and Endometriosis Treatment Using Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implant for reversible fallopian tube occlusion, offering an alternative to permanent sterilization and endometriosis treatment, is introduced. These hydrogel implants mechanically block the tubes with high effectiveness and are removable within 30 min using UV light or a glutathione solution. Demonstrating in ex vivo and in vivo models, this multifunctional system provides a potential method for on&#8208;demand contraception and a mechanical approach to prevent and treat abdominal endometriosis.








Abstract
Female sterilization via fallopian tube ligation is a common procedure; However, after the operation, over 10% of women seek re&#8208;fertilization, which is frequently unsuccessful. In addition, there is evidence that fallopian tubes contribute to the spread of endometriotic tissue as they serve as channels for proinflammatory media entering the abdominal cavity via retrograde menstruation. Here, stimuli&#8208;degradable hydrogel implants are presented for the functional, biocompatible, and reversible occlusion of fallopian tubes. The hydrogel implants, designed with customized swelling properties, mechanically occlude fallopian tubes in a high&#8208;performance manner with burst pressures reaching 255&#8211;558&#160;mmHg, exceeding normal abdominal pressures (95&#160;mmHg). Their damage&#8208;free removal can be achieved within 30 min using near&#8208;visible UV light or a glutathione solution, employing a method akin to standard fallopian tube perfusion diagnostics. Ultrasound&#8208;guided implant placement is demonstrated using a clinical hysteroscope in a human&#8208;scale uterus model and biocompatibility in a porcine in vivo model. Importantly, the prevention of live sperm as well as endometrial cell passage through blocked fallopian tubes is demonstrated. Overall, a multifunctional system is presented that constitutes a possible means of on&#8208;demand, reversible contraception along with the first&#8208;ever mechanical approach to abdominal endometriosis prevention and treatment.

         <title>Secondary Amines Functionalized Organocatalytic Iodine Redox for High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Dual&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The organocatalytic mechanism of secondary amine functionalized phenylamine&#8208;based conjugated microporous polymer (PA&#8208;CMP) cathode on iodine redox through H&#183;&#183;&#183;I bridging is systematically investigated. The I&#8722; anion based aqueous dual&#8208;ion battery demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance with ultrahigh capacity of 730/516 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, ultralow overpotential of 47/129 mV at 1/15 A g&#8722;1, and stable long&#8208;term performance for over 5000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous dual&#8208;ion batteries (ADIBs) based on the cooperative redox of cations and iodine anions at the anode and cathode respectively, are attracting increasing interest because of high capacity and safety. However, the full&#8208;cell performance is limited by the sluggish iodine redox kinetics between iodide and polyiodide involving multiple electron transfer steps, and the undesirable shuttling effect of polyiodides. Here, this work reports a versatile conjugated microporous polymer functionalized with secondary amine groups as an organocatalytic cathode for ADIB, which can be positively charged and electrostatically adsorb iodide, and organocatalyze iodine redox reactions through the amine groups. Both theoretical calculations and controlled experiments confirm that the secondary amine groups confine (poly)iodide species via hydrogen bonding, which is essential for accelerating iodine redox kinetics and reducing the polyiodide shuttling effect. The ADIB achieves an ultrahigh capacity of 730 mAh g&#8722;1 with an ultrasmall overpotential of 47&#160;mV at 1 A g&#8722;1, which also exhibits excellent rate performance and long cycling stability with a capacity retention of 74% after 5000 cycles at a high current density of 5&#8201;A&#8201;g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the promise of developing organocatalysts for accelerating electrochemical processes, which remains a virtually unexplored area in electrocatalyst design for clean energy applications.

         <title>RhNi Bimetallenes with Lattice&#8208;Compressed Rh Skin towards Ultrastable Acidic Nitrate Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
RhNi bimetallenes with a Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability for over 400 h towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction, which also reveals an excellent catalytic performance, including a high NH3 yield (13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1) and a commendable NH3 Faradaic efficiency (98.4%).








Abstract
Harvesting recyclable ammonia (NH3) from acidic nitrate (NO3&#8722;)&#8208;containing wastewater requires the utilization of corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalytic materials with high activity and selectivity towards acidic electrochemical nitrate reduction (NO3ER). Herein, ultrathin RhNi bimetallenes with Rh&#8208;skin&#8208;type structure (RhNi@Rh BMLs) are fabricated towards acidic NO3ER. The Rh&#8208;skin atoms on the surface of RhNi@Rh BMLs experience the lattice compression&#8208;induced strain effect, resulting in shortened Rh&#8211;Rh bond and downshifted d&#8208;band center. Experimental and theoretical calculation results corroborate that Rh&#8208;skin atoms can inhibit NO2*/NH2* adsorption&#8208;induced Rh dissolution, contributing to the exceptional electrocatalytic durability of RhNi@Rh BMLs (over 400 h) towards acidic NO3ER. RhNi@Rh BMLs also reveal an excellent catalytic performance, boasting a 98.4% NH3 Faradaic efficiency and a 13.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 NH3 yield. Theoretical calculations reveal that compressive stress tunes the electronic structure of Rh skin atoms, which facilitates the reduction of NO* to NOH* in NO3ER. The practicality of RhNi@Rh BMLs has also been confirmed in an alkaline&#8208;acidic hybrid zinc&#8208;nitrate battery with a 1.39&#160;V open circuit voltage and a 10.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 power density. This work offers valuable insights into the nature of electrocatalyst deactivation behavior and guides the development of high&#8208;efficiency corrosion&#8208;resistant electrocatalysts for applications in energy and environment.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition Synthesis of Intrinsic High&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric 2D CuCrSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 single crystal. The ultrathin CuCrSe2 nanosheet exhibits a high Curie temperature TC of 800 K. The in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in 2D CuCrSe2 are characterized by piezo&#8208;response force microscopy measurements and confirmed by the lateral and vertical devices.








Abstract
Ultrathin 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature are critical for multifunctional ferroelectric devices. However, the ferroelectric spontaneous polarization is consistently broken by the strong thermal fluctuations at high temperature, resulting in the rare discovery of high&#8208;temperature ferroelectricity in 2D materials. Here, a chemical vapor deposition method is reported to synthesize 2D CuCrSe2 nanosheets. The crystal structure is confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy characterization. The measured ferroelectric phase transition temperature of ultrathin CuCrSe2 is about &#8776;800 K. Significantly, the switchable ferroelectric polarization is observed in &#8776;5.2&#160;nm nanosheet. Moreover, the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric response are modulated by different maximum bias voltage. This work provides a new insight into the construction of 2D ferroelectrics with high Curie temperature.

         <title>Homeostatic Solid Solution Reaction in Phosphate Cathode: Breaking High&#8208;Voltage Barrier to Achieve High Energy Density and Long Life of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The homeostatic solid solution characteristics drive the phosphate with multilevel redox (MLNP) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), breaking through the high barrier of intrinsic mono&#8208;redox center with sluggish reactivity&#160;by differentiating each redox couple. This establishes fast and stable reaction kinetics, balancing multi&#8208;electron transfer and low strain to develope high energy&#8208;density and durable NASICON cathodes for SIBs.








Abstract
The stable phase transformation during electrochemical progress drives extensive research on vanadium&#8208;based polyanions in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), especially Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP). And the electron transfer between V3+/4+ redox couple in NVP could be generally achieved, owing to the confined crystal variation during battery service. However, the more favorable V4+/5+ redox couple is still in hard&#8208;to&#8208;access situation due to the high barrier and further brings about the corresponding inefficiency in energy densities. In this work, the multilevel redox in NVP frame (MLNP) alters reaction pathway to undergo homeostatic solid solution process and breaks the high barrier of V4+/5+ at high voltage, taking by progressive transition metal (V, Fe, Ti, and Cr) redox couple. The diversified reaction paths across diffusion barriers could be realized by distinctive release/uptake of inactive Na1 site, confirmed by the calculations of density functional theory. Thereby its volume change is merely 1.73% during the multielectron&#8208;transfer process (&#8776;2.77 electrons). MLNP cathode could achieve an impressive energy density of 440&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, driving the leading development of MLNP among other NASICON structure SIBs. The integration of multiple redox couples with low strain modulates the reaction pathway effectively and will open a new avenue for fabricating high&#8208;performance cathodes in SIBs.

         <title>Simple&#8208;Structured Acceptor with Highly Interconnected Electron&#8208;Transport Pathway Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge transport plays a significant role in determining the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a highly interconnected electron&#8208;transport pathway in simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) is achieved by manipulating the alkyl&#8208;chain topology. Therefore, the 3TTB&#8208;4F with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains demonstrates a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certified 16.59%), establishing it as the highest efficiency among NFREA&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
Achieving desirable charge&#8208;transport highway is of vital importance for high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, it is shown how molecular packing arrangements can be regulated via tuning the alkyl&#8208;chain topology, thus resulting in a 3D network stacking and highly interconnected pathway for electron transport in a simple&#8208;structured nonfused&#8208;ring electron acceptor (NFREA) with branched alkyl side&#8208;chains. As a result, a record&#8208;breaking power conversion efficiency of 17.38% (certificated 16.59%) is achieved for NFREA&#8208;based devices, thus providing an opportunity for constructing low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficiency OSCs.

         <title>A 2D Cryptographic Hash Function Incorporating Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Digital Signatures (Adv. Mater. 23/2024)</title>

Hardware Security
In article number 2400661, Akshay Wali, Harikrishnan Ravichandran, and Saptarshi Das present a novel hardware security authentication system that employs programmable integrated circuits (ICs) crafted from atomically thin monolayers of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a two&#8208;dimensional material. It capitalizes on the inherent randomness of charge trapping and de&#8208;trapping in 2D memtransistors to generate cryptographic keys. Additionally, it utilizes the properties of a NOR gate to establish a secure one&#8208;way hash function.

Immunotherapy
The image demonstrates the ionic liquid embolic exiting the tip of a catheter and filling the arteries of the tumor. The purple color depicts the ablation of the vessel wall and the adjacent tumor tissue as the ionic liquid diffuses across the vessel wall. As the ionic liquid diffuses trans&#8208;arterially, it carries its payload, which in this case is Nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug. Along the margins of the tumor ablation, Nivolumab is seen interacting with cells enabling immunotherapy to occur. More details can be found in article number 2309412 by Rahmi Oklu and co&#8208;workers.

Radiotherapy Adjuvant
In article number 2311291, Yuliang Zhao, Zhihua Liu, Chunying Chen, and co&#8208;workers report that a novel lipid&#8208;modified manganese diselenide nanoparticle (MnSe2&#8208;lipid) with extraordinarily uniform sphere morphology and tumor microenvironment responsiveness is developed. The released Mn2+ promotes radiosensitivity by generating reactive oxygen species induced by Fenton&#8208;like reaction and activating cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Spontaneously, selenium strengthens immune response and performs antioxidant activity to reduce side&#8208;effects of radiotherapy.

Reversible hydrogel implants for fallopian tube occlusion offer a potential solution for both reversible contraception and mechanical prevention of endometriosis. The soft hydrogel implant effectively blocks fallopian tubes, prevents sperm and endometrial cell crossing, and can be safely removed on demand by hysteroscopic light application. More details can be found in article number 2310301 by Alexandre H.C. Anthis, Inge K. Herrmann, and co&#8208;workers.

Van Der Waals Colloidal Crystals
In article number 2312748, Seungwoo Lee and co&#8208;workers report a method for the unexplored van der Waals force&#8208;driven colloidal crystallization. This study demonstrates how to modulate their inter&#8208;particle interaction, enabling the colloidal crystallization with liquid gap. The diffractive colors of the colloidal crystals have been visualized through optical microscopy, correlate with their SEM image.

3D Printing of Double Network Granular Elastomers
The frontispiece showcases a granular ink composed of elastomeric microparticles that is 3D printed through direct ink writing (DIW) into the iconic Matterhorn, the Swiss mountain landmark. In article number 2313189, Eva Baur, Benjamin Tiberghien, and Esther Amstad solidify the granular structure without compromising the shape fidelity of the printed object by forming a 2nd percolating elastomer network across the microparticles to result in double network granular elastomers (DNGEs).

         <title>In Vivo Stimulation of Therapeutic Antigen&#8208;Specific T Cells in an Artificial Lymph Node Matrix (Adv. Mater. 23/2024)</title>

Artificial Lymph Node
In article number 2310043, Hai&#8208;Quan Mao, Jonathan P. Schneck, and co&#8208;workers report an artificial lymph node (aLN) biomatrix composed of a hydrogel conjugated with T cell stimulating signals. Following subcutaneous injection, this aLN biomatrix develops into a complex immune niche in vivo. Na&#239;ve, adoptively transferred T cells are stimulated within the aLN in an antigen&#8208;specific manner through direct interaction with the matrix. The cover art depicts a novel aLN hydrogel biomatrix which when injected subcutaneously, is capable of simulating adoptively transferred na&#239;ve T cells and recruiting an array of endogenous immune cells. Upon entering the porous biomatrix, na&#239;ve T cells (green) bind to the antigen&#8208;specific stimulating signals conjugated to the hydrogel matrix and are activated (yellow) and interact with the recruited cells in the dynamic immune microenvironment, which facilitate the expansion and differentiation into effector and memory T&#8208;cells (orange). The activated T cells then emigrate and travel to the tumor where they can directly kill the tumor cells and lead to increased survival of animals with established tumors.

         <title>Structuring and Shaping of Mechanically Robust and Functional Hydrogels toward Wearable and Implantable Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The remarkable similarities to living tissues make hydrogels especially suitable for biointegrated applications that closely interact with human bodies. Recent progress in polymer science and advanced processing technologies that enable the mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels are reviewed. Moreover, perspectives on further development of mechanically reliable, adaptive biointegrated hydrogel devices for practical use are discussed.








Abstract
Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man&#8208;made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nanoscales for toughening hydrogels are summarized, and representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels are further discussed. Three categories of processing technologies, namely, 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes are reviewed, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, and soft robotics.

&lt;p&gt;Hydrogels possess unique features such as softness, wetness, responsiveness, and biocompatibility, making them highly suitable for biointegrated applications that have close interactions with living organisms. However, conventional man-made hydrogels are usually soft and brittle, making them inferior to the mechanically robust biological hydrogels. To ensure reliable and durable operation of biointegrated wearable and implantable devices, mechanical matching and shape adaptivity of hydrogels to tissues and organs are essential. Recent advances in polymer science and processing technologies have enabled mechanical engineering and shaping of hydrogels for various biointegrated applications. In this review, polymer network structuring strategies at micro/nanoscales for toughening hydrogels are summarized, and representative mechanical functionalities that exist in biological materials but are not easily achieved in synthetic hydrogels are further discussed. Three categories of processing technologies, namely, 3D printing, spinning, and coating for fabrication of tough hydrogel constructs with complex shapes are reviewed, and the corresponding hydrogel toughening strategies are also highlighted. These developments enable adaptive fabrication of mechanically robust and functional hydrogel devices, and promote application of hydrogels in the fields of biomedical engineering, bioelectronics, and soft robotics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical use of medical microrobots gets closer to reality with the rapidly growing biomedical research on them. However, the clinical translation of microrobots has several challenges and obstacles, including scalability, biocompatibility, and imaging. In this review article, a realistic roadmap for medical microrobots is conceptualized with the collaborative efforts of microrobot researchers and&#160;clinicians.








Abstract
Medical microrobotics is an emerging field to revolutionize clinical applications in diagnostics and therapeutics of various diseases. On the other hand, the mobile microrobotics field has important obstacles to pass before clinical translation. This article focuses on these challenges and provides a roadmap of medical microrobots to enable their clinical use. From the concept of a &#8220;magic bullet&#8221; to the physicochemical interactions of microrobots in complex biological environments in medical applications, there are several translational steps to consider. Clinical translation of mobile microrobots is only possible with a close collaboration between clinical experts and microrobotics researchers to address the technical challenges in microfabrication, safety, and imaging. The clinical application potential can be materialized by designing microrobots that can solve the current main challenges, such as actuation limitations, material stability, and imaging constraints. The strengths and weaknesses of the current progress in the microrobotics field are discussed and a roadmap for their clinical applications in the near future is&#160;outlined.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk sericin, as an advanced biomedical material, exhibits well cytocompatibility, low immunogenicity, cell function&#8208;regulating activities, etc. This review summarizes the latest fundamental advances and biomedical applications of this natural sericin bioactive material and discusses unsolved issues, potential applications, and future research directions.








Abstract
Sericin, a protein derived from silkworm cocoons, is considered a waste product derived from the silk industry for thousands of years due to a lack of understanding of its properties. However, in recent decades, a range of exciting properties of sericin are studied and uncovered, including cytocompatibility, low&#8208;immunogenicity, photo&#8208;luminescence, antioxidant properties, as well as cell&#8208;function regulating activities. These properties make sericin&#8208;based biomaterials promising candidates for biomedical applications. This review summarizes the properties and bioactivities of silk sericin and highlights the latest developments in sericin in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the extended application of sericin in developing flexible electronic devices and 3D bioprinting is also discussed. It is believed that sericin&#8208;based biomaterials have great potential of being developed into novel tissue engineering products and smart implantable devices for various medical applications toward improving clinical outcomes.

         <title>Recent Progress in Implantable Drug Delivery Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review details the recent progress of implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs) with spatiotemporally&#8208;controlled drug release capabilities. The stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms, including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, electricity, magnetism, etc.) are reviewed. The advantages and disadvantages of various IDDSs, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are discussed.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous effort is devoted to developing platforms, such as implantable drug delivery systems (IDDSs), with temporally and spatially controlled drug release capabilities and improved adherence. IDDSs have multiple advantages: i) the timing and location of drug delivery can be controlled by patients using specific stimuli (light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.). Some intelligent &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS can even realize self&#8208;management without human participation. ii) IDDSs enable continuous and stable delivery of drugs over a long period (months to years) and iii) to administer drugs directly to the lesion, thereby helping reduce dosage and side effects. iv) IDDSs enable personalized drug delivery according to patient needs. The high demand for such systems has prompted scientists to make efforts to develop intelligent IDDS. In this review, several common stimulus&#8208;responsive mechanisms including endogenous (e.g., pH, reactive oxygen species, proteins, etc.) and exogenous stimuli (e.g., light, sound, electricity, magnetism, etc.), are given in detail. Besides, several types of IDDS reported in recent years are reviewed, including various stimulus&#8208;responsive systems based on the above mechanisms, radio frequency&#8208;controlled IDDS, &#8220;closed&#8208;loop&#8221; IDDS, self&#8208;powered IDDS, etc. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of various IDDS, bottleneck problems, and possible solutions are analyzed to provide directions for subsequent research.

         <title>From Nature&#8208;Sourced Polysaccharide Particles to Advanced Functional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biosourced polysaccharide particles have promising applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, bioengineering, food industry, and several other fields. This review highlights progresses in advanced materials derived from polysaccharide particles, along as the description of their extraction, fabrication, and modification.








Abstract
Polysaccharides constitute over 90% of the carbohydrate mass in nature, which makes them a promising feedstock for manufacturing sustainable materials. Polysaccharide particles (PSPs) are used as effective scavengers, carriers of chemical and biological cargos, and building blocks for the fabrication of macroscopic materials. The biocompatibility and degradability of PSPs are advantageous for their uses as biomaterials with more environmental friendliness. This review highlights the progresses in PSP applications as advanced functional materials, by describing PSP extraction, preparation, and surface functionalization with a variety of functional groups, polymers, nanoparticles, and biologically active species. This review also outlines the fabrication of PSP&#8208;derived macroscopic materials, as well as their applications in soft robotics, sensing, scavenging, water harvesting, drug delivery, and bioengineering. The paper is concluded with an outlook providing perspectives in the development and applications of PSP&#8208;derived materials.

         <title>Interfacial Solar Evaporation: From Fundamental Research to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews the development of interfacial solar evaporation technologies, covering the design and fabrication of high&#8208;performance photothermal materials and solar evaporators, the energy nexus of 2D and 3D evaporation systems, and the corresponding energy management strategies, and the explored applications to solve practical issues. The summarized knowledge offers a perspective for future study and development of the field.








Abstract
In the last decade, interfacial solar steam generation (ISSG), powered by natural sunlight garnered significant attention due to its great potential for low&#8208;cost and environmentally friendly clean water production in alignment with the global decarbonization efforts. This review aims to share the knowledge and engage with a broader readership about the current progress of ISSG technology and the facing challenges to promote further advancements toward practical applications. The first part of this review assesses the current strategies for enhancing the energy efficiency of ISSG systems, including optimizing light absorption, reducing energy losses, harvesting additional energy, and lowering evaporation enthalpy. Subsequently, the current challenges faced by ISSG technologies, notably salt accumulation and bio&#8208;fouling issues in practical applications, are elucidated and contemporary methods are discussed to overcome these challenges. In the end, potential applications of ISSG, ranging from initial seawater desalination and industrial wastewater purification to power generation, sterilization, soil remediation, and innovative concept of solar sea farm, are introduced, highlighting the promising potential of ISSG technology in contributing to sustainable and environmentally conscious practices. Based on the review and in&#8208;depth understanding of these aspects, the future research focuses are proposed to address potential issues in both fundamental research and practical applications.

         <title>Degradation Mechanisms of Electrodes Promotes Direct Regeneration of Spent Li&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) has attracted considerable attention compared to traditional recycling methods. Only by having an adequate understanding of degradation mechanisms and defective types of failed materials can be found more suitable and efficient methods for direct repairing spent LIBs. A comprehensive overview of degradation mechanisms and regeneration methods for spent LIBs is provided.








Abstract
The rapid growth of electric vehicle use is expected to cause a significant environmental problem in the next few years due to the large number of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Recycling spent LIBs will not only alleviate the environmental problems but also address the challenge of limited natural resources shortages. While several hydro&#8208; and pyrometallurgical processes are developed for recycling different components of spent batteries, direct regeneration presents clear environmental, and economic advantages. The principle of the direct regeneration approach is restoring the electrochemical performance by healing the defective structure of the spent materials. Thus, the development of direct regeneration technology largely depends on the formation mechanism of defects in spent LIBs. This review systematically details the degradation mechanisms and types of defects found in diverse cathode materials, graphite anodes, and current collectors during the battery's lifecycle. Building on this understanding, principles and methodologies for directly rejuvenating materials within spent LIBs are outlined. Also the main challenges and solutions for the large&#8208;scale direct regeneration of spent LIBs are proposed. Furthermore, this review aims to pave the way for the direct regeneration of materials in discarded lithium&#8208;ion batteries by offering a theoretical foundation and practical guidance.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Film&#8208;to&#8208;Bulk Assembly Toward Bioinspired Bulk Structural Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites have received extensive attention owing to the requirements of structural applications. In this review, the bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy is highlighted as a simple, flexible, and scalable path toward fabricating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand. Specifically, its design principles, comprehensive advantages, flexible extensions, along with recent advances in bioinspired structural materials are discussed, respectively.








Abstract
Biological materials, although composed of meager minerals and biopolymers, often exhibit amazing mechanical properties far beyond their components due to hierarchically ordered structures. Understanding their structure&#8211;properties relationships and replicating them into artificial materials would boost the development of bulk structural nanocomposites. Layered microstructure widely exists in biological materials, serving as the fundamental structure in nanosheet&#8208;based nacres and nanofiber&#8208;based Bouligand tissues, and implying superior mechanical properties. High&#8208;efficient and scalable fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with precise layered microstructure is therefore important yet remains difficult. Here, one straightforward bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy is focused for fabricating bioinspired layered bulk structural nanocomposites. The bottom&#8208;up assembly strategy inherently offers a methodology for precise construction of bioinspired layered microstructure in bulk form, availability for fabrication of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites with large sizes and complex shapes, possibility for design of multiscale interfaces, feasibility for manipulation of diverse heterogeneities. Not limited to discussing what has been achieved by using the current bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy, it is also envisioned how to promote such an assembly strategy to better benefit the development of bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites. Compared to other assembly strategies, the highlighted strategy provides great opportunities for creating bioinspired bulk structural nanocomposites on demand.

         <title>Engineering Quantum Light Sources with Flat Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores latest development of leveraging flat&#8208;optics to generate ultra&#8208;compact quantum light sources with improved efficiency and added functionalities. It highlights photon&#8208;pair sources with nonlinear metasurfaces and single&#8208;photon emitters in 3D and 2D materials integrated with metasurfaces. The review also discusses current challenges and provide insights into the potential future directions for advancing flat&#8208;optics quantum light&#160;sources.








Abstract
Quantum light sources are essential building blocks for many quantum technologies, enabling secure communication, powerful computing, and precise sensing and imaging. Recent advancements have witnessed a significant shift toward the utilization of &#8220;flat&#8221; optics with thickness at subwavelength scales for the development of quantum light sources. This approach offers notable advantages over conventional bulky counterparts, including compactness, scalability, and improved efficiency, along with added functionalities. This review focuses on the recent advances in leveraging flat optics to generate quantum light sources. Specifically, the generation of entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down&#8208;conversion in nonlinear metasurfaces, and single photon emission from quantum emitters including quantum dots and color centers in 3D and 2D materials are explored. The review covers theoretical principles, fabrication techniques, and properties of these sources, with particular emphasis on the enhanced generation and engineering of quantum light sources using optical resonances supported by nanostructures. The diverse application range of these sources is discussed and the current challenges and perspectives in the field are&#160;highlighted.

         <title>Locally Strained 2D Materials: Preparation, Properties, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 23, June 6, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials hold great promise in strain engineering. By introducing out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, localized and non&#8208;uniform strain can be induced, leading to novel phenomena and unique properties. This review systematically outlines the recent progress in the preparation, properties, and applications of locally strained 2D materials, aiming to broaden the scope of the 2D family for diverse applications.








Abstract
2D materials are promising for strain engineering due to their atomic thickness and exceptional mechanical properties. In particular, non&#8208;uniform and localized strain can be induced in 2D materials by generating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane deformations, resulting in novel phenomena and properties, as witnessed in recent years. Therefore, the locally strained 2D materials are of great value for both fundamental studies and practical applications. This review discusses techniques for introducing local strains to 2D materials, and their feasibility, advantages, and challenges. Then, the unique effects and properties that arise from local strain are explored. The representative applications based on locally strained 2D materials are illustrated, including memristor, single photon emitter, and photodetector. Finally, concluding remarks on the challenges and opportunities in the emerging field of locally strained 2D materials are provided.

Abstract
Ionic liquids and their various analogues are without doubt the scientific sensation of the last few decades, paving the way to a more sustainable society. Their versatile suite of properties, originating from an almost inconceivably large number of possible cation and anion combinations, allows tuning of the structure to serve a desired purpose. Ionic liquids hence offer a myriad of useful applications from solvents to catalysts, through to lubricants, gas absorbers, and azeotrope breakers. The purpose of this review is to explore the more unexpected of these applications, particularly in the energy space. It guides the reader through the application of ionic liquids and their analogues as i) phase change materials for thermal energy storage, ii) organic ionic plastic crystals, which have been studied as battery electrolytes and in gas separation, iii) key components in the nitrogen reduction reaction for sustainable ammonia generation, iv) as electrolytes in aluminum&#8208;ion batteries, and v) in other emerging technologies. It is concluded that there is tremendous scope for further optimizing and tuning of the ionic liquid in its task, subject to sustainability imperatives in line with current global priorities, assisted by artificial intelligence.

Their versatile suite of properties, originating from an almost inconceivably large number of possible cation and anion combinations, allows tuning of the structure to serve a desired purpose. Ionic liquids hence offer a myriad of useful applications from solvents to catalysts, through to lubricants, gas absorbers, and azeotrope breakers. The purpose of this review is to explore the more unexpected of these applications, particularly in the energy space. It guides the reader through the application of ionic liquids and their analogues as i) phase change materials for thermal energy storage, ii) organic ionic plastic crystals, which have been studied as battery electrolytes and in gas separation, iii) key components in the nitrogen reduction reaction for sustainable ammonia generation, iv) as electrolytes in aluminum-ion batteries, and v) in other emerging technologies. It is concluded that there is tremendous scope for further optimizing and tuning of the ionic liquid in its task, subject to sustainability imperatives in line with current global priorities, assisted by artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel millifluidic nanogenerator lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip device to measure blood conductivity at low frequencies. The device utilizes blood as a conductive substance in its built&#8208;in triboelectric nanogenerator system. AI models analyze the device voltage patterns to estimate conductivity accurately. The 3D&#8208;printed, self&#8208;powering, and disposable design enhances portability, offering rapid point&#8208;of&#8208;care assessment.








Abstract
The electrical conductivity of blood is a crucial physiological parameter with diverse applications in medical diagnostics. Here, a novel approach utilizing a portable millifluidic nanogenerator lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip device for measuring blood conductivity at low frequencies, is introduced. The proposed device employs blood as a conductive substance within its built&#8208;in triboelectric nanogenerator system. The voltage generated by this blood&#8208;based nanogenerator device is analyzed to determine the electrical conductivity of the blood sample. The self&#8208;powering functionality of the device eliminates the need for complex embedded electronics and external electrodes. Experimental results using simulated body fluid and human blood plasma demonstrate the device's efficacy in detecting variations in conductivity related to changes in electrolyte concentrations. Furthermore, artificial intelligence models are used to analyze the generated voltage patterns and to estimate the blood electrical conductivity. The models exhibit high accuracy in predicting conductivity based solely on the device&#8208;generated voltage. The 3D&#8208;printed, disposable design of the device enhances portability and usability, providing a point&#8208;of&#8208;care solution for rapid blood conductivity assessment. A comparative analysis with traditional conductivity measurement methods highlights the advantages of the proposed device in terms of simplicity, portability, and adaptability for various applications beyond blood analysis.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and catalyst stability, electro&#8208;driven intercalation is employed to form Cu&#8208;In dual&#8208;active sites with sulfur vacancies for the simultaneous adsorption of *H and *CO intermediates. This catalyst facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting step of *CHO formation for the key *OCHCHO* intermediate of ethanol production, delivering a stable and high rate of ethanol formation from CO2 electrolysis.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess carbon dioxide (CO2) is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here it is proposed to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 for over 120 h. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 h, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is &#8776;19%.

         <title>Eagle&#8208;Eye Inspired Meta&#8208;Device for Phase Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eagle's eyes, equipped with bifocals, demonstrate the ability to capture the bear, analogous to the authors&#8217; designed meta&#8208;device with two focal lengths, which enables the capture of phase information from the &#8220;transparent bear.&#8221;








Abstract
The dual&#8208;focus vision observed in eagles' eyes is an intriguing phenomenon captivates scientists since a long time. Inspired by this natural occurrence, the authors&#8217; research introduces a novel bifocal meta&#8208;device incorporating a polarized camera capable of simultaneously capturing images for two different polarizations with slightly different focal distances. This innovative approach facilitates the concurrent acquisition of underfocused and overfocused images in a single snapshot, enabling the effective extraction of quantitative phase information from the object using the transport of intensity equation. Experimental demonstrations showcase the application of quantitative phase imaging to artificial objects and human embryonic kidney cells, particularly emphasizing the meta&#8208;device's relevance in dynamic scenarios such as laser&#8208;induced ablation in human embryonic kidney cells. Moreover, it provides a solution for the quantification during the dynamic process at the cellular level. Notably, the proposed eagle&#8208;eye inspired meta&#8208;device for phase imaging (EIMPI), due to its simplicity and compact nature, holds promise for significant applications in fields such as endoscopy and headsets, where a lightweight and compact setup is essential.

Abstract

This perspective presents the historical overview, general design principles, recent developments, and future outlook of self&#8208;healing materials for bioelectronic devices, which integrates topics in many research disciplines&#8212;from materials science and chemistry to electronics and bioengineering&#8212;together.

         <title>Active Fabrics With Controllable Stiffness for Robotic Assistive Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, active fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are developed. They achieve rapid transitions between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&gt;350 times stiffness change). Applications including exosuits for tremor suppression, lifting assistance, and impact&#8208;mitigating body armors are presented.








Abstract
Assistive interfaces enable collaborative interactions between humans and robots. In contrast to traditional rigid devices, conformable fabrics with tunable mechanical properties have emerged as compelling alternatives. However, existing assistive fabrics actuated by fluidic or thermal stimuli struggle to adapt to complex body contours and are hindered by challenges such as large volumes after actuation and slow response rates. To overcome these limitations, inspiration is drawn from biological protective organisms combining hard and soft phases, and active assistive fabrics consisting of architectured rigid tiles interconnected with flexible actuated fibers are proposed. Through programmable tessellation of target body shapes into architectured tiles and controlling their interactions by the actuated fibers, the active fabrics can rapidly transition between soft compliant configurations and rigid states conformable to the body (&gt;350 times stiffness change) while minimizing the device volume after actuation. The versatility of these active fabrics is demonstrated as exosuits for tremor suppression and lifting assistance,&#160;as body armors for impact mitigation, and integration with&#160;electrothermal actuators for smart actuation with convenient folding capabilities. This work offers a practical framework for designing customizable active fabrics with shape adaptivity and controllable stiffness, suitable for applications in wearable exosuits, haptic devices, and medical rehabilitation systems.

The versatility of these active fabrics is demonstrated as exosuits for tremor suppression and lifting assistance,&#160;as body armors for impact mitigation, and integration with&#160;electrothermal actuators for smart actuation with convenient folding capabilities. This work offers a practical framework for designing customizable active fabrics with shape adaptivity and controllable stiffness, suitable for applications in wearable exosuits, haptic devices, and medical rehabilitation systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Charged Near&#8208;Infrared Persistent Luminescence in Organics by Intermolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controllable hour&#8208;level near&#8208;infrared (NIR) persistent luminescence is achieved by incorporating intermolecular charge transfer and trap states into a typical host&#8208;guest organic system. The constructed host&#8208;guest system allows for charge separation under visible light and efficient light&#8208;energy storage at room temperature by trap states, thus enabling a new triple&#8208;mode NIR anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information storage technology.








Abstract
Visible light is a universal and user&#8208;friendly excitation source; however, its use to generate persistent luminescence (PersL) in materials remains a huge challenge. Herein, the concept of intermolecular charge transfer (xCT) is applied in typical host&#8211;guest molecular systems, which allows for a much lower energy requirement for charge separation, thus enabling efficient charging of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) PersL in organics by visible light (425&#8211;700&#160;nm). Importantly, NIR PersL in organics occurs via the trapping of electrons from charge&#8208;transfer aggregates (CTAs) into constructed trap states with trap depths of 0.63&#8211;1.17&#160;eV, followed by the detrapping of these electrons by thermal stimulation, resulting in a unique light&#8208;storage effect and long&#8208;lasting emission up to 4.6 h at room temperature. The xCT absorption range is modulated by changing the electron&#8208;donating ability of a series of acenaphtho[1,2&#8208;b]pyrazine&#8208;8,9&#8208;dicarbonitrile&#8208;based CTAs, and the organic PersL is tuned from 681 to 722&#160;nm. This study on xCT interaction&#8208;induced NIR PersL in organic materials provides a major step forward in understanding the underlying luminescence mechanism of organic semiconductors and these findings are expected to promote their applications in optoelectronics, energy storage, and medical diagnosis.

An artificial intelligence agent for enhancing organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) performance by combining generative pre&#8208;trained transformer 4 (GPT&#8208;4) with advanced machine learning algorithms is presented. It efficiently extracts OFET experimental data from extensive literature and gives intelligent suggestions for OFET fabrication. This work showcases the application of large language models in organic optoelectronics, enhancing the development process in this field.









Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) have attracted widespread attention recently, however, their application in specialized scientific fields still requires deep adaptation. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent for organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is designed by integrating the generative pre&#8208;trained transformer 4 (GPT&#8208;4)&#160;model with well&#8208;trained machine learning (ML) algorithms. It can efficiently extract the experimental parameters of OFETs from scientific literature and reshape them into a structured database, achieving precision and recall rates both exceeding 92%. Combined with well&#8208;trained ML models, this AI agent can further provide targeted guidance and suggestions for device design. With prompt engineering and human&#8208;in&#8208;loop strategies, the agent extracts sufficient information of 709 OFETs from 277 research articles across different publishers and gathers them into a standardized database containing more than 10&#160;000 device parameters. Using this database, a ML model based on Extreme Gradient Boosting is trained for device performance judgment. Combined with the interpretation of the high&#8208;precision model, the agent has provided a feasible optimization scheme that has tripled the charge transport properties of 2,6&#8208;diphenyldithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene OFETs. This work is an effective practice of LLMs in the field of organic optoelectronic devices and expands the research paradigm of organic optoelectronic materials and devices.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Scribed Battery Electrodes for Ultrafast Zinc&#8208;Ion Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a simple, one&#8208;step laser&#8208;scribing synthesis approach to produce a vanadium&#8208;based cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion energy storage with high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and cycling stability. The underlying mechanism of charge storage to be the co&#8208;insertion of zinc and hydronium ions with minimal lattice change upon cycling, which facilitates the observed gains in performance, is further revealed.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn batteries are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage but are plagued by the lack of high&#8208;performance cathode materials that enable high specific capacity, ultrafast charging, and outstanding cycling stability. Here, a laser&#8208;scribed nano&#8208;vanadium oxide (LNVO) cathode is designed that can simultaneously achieve these properties. The material stores charge through Faradaic redox reactions on/near the surface at fast rates owing to the small grain size of vanadium oxide and interpenetrating 3D graphene network, displaying a surface&#8208;controlled capacity contribution (90%&#8211;98%). Multiple characterization techniques unambiguously reveal that zinc and hydronium ions co&#8208;insert with minimal lattice change upon cycling. It is demonstrated that a high specific capacity of 553 mAh g&#8722;1 is achieved at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, and an impressive 264 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity is retained at 100 A g&#8722;1 within 10 s, showing excellent rate capability. The LNVO/Zn can also reach &gt;90% capacity retention after 3000 cycles at a high rate of 30 A g&#8722;1, as well as achieving both high energy (369 Wh kg&#8722;1) and power densities (56306 W kg&#8722;1). Moreover, the LNVO cathode retains its excellent cycling performance when integrated into quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, further demonstrating mechanical stability and its potential for practical application in wearable and grid&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Inhibiting Demetalation of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C via Mn Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mn acts as an electron donor to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density at the Fe&#9472;N4 site, thereby strengthening the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. As a result, FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent discharge performance and stability in Zn&#8208;air batteries.








Abstract
Demetalation caused by the electrochemical dissolution of metallic Fe atoms is a major challenge for the practical application of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalysts. Herein, an efficient single metallic Mn active site is constructed to improve the strength of the Fe&#9472;N bond, inhibiting the demetalation effect of Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C. Mn acts as an electron donor inducing more delocalized electrons to reduce the oxidation state of Fe by increasing the electron density, thereby enhancing the Fe&#9472;N bond and inhibiting the electrochemical dissolution of Fe. The oxygen reduction reaction pathway for the dissociation of Fe&#9472;Mn dual sites can overcome the high energy barriers to direct O&#9472;O bond dissociation and modulate the electronic states of Fe&#9472;N4 sites. The resulting FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C exhibits excellent ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.92&#160;V in alkaline electrolytes. FeMn&#9472;N&#9472;C as a cathode catalyst for Zn&#8208;air batteries has a cycle stability of 700&#160;h at 25&#160;&#176;C and a long cycle stability of more than 210&#160;h under extremely cold conditions at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. These findings contribute to the development of efficient and stable metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon catalysts for various energy devices.

         <title>Synergistic Machine Learning Accelerated Discovery of Nanoporous Inorganic Crystals as Non&#8208;Absorbable Oral Drugs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic machine learning accelerates the discovery of high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;selectivity, and stable inorganic nanoporous crystals as non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs). NODs can remove unwanted molecules or ions from the gastrointestinal tract of the human body without directly entering the bloodstream. NH4&#8208;form merlinoite (NH4&#8208;MER) discovered by synergistic machine learning can prevent the Na+ release from ZS&#8208;9 in the treatment of hyperkalemia.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has taken drug discovery to new heights, where effective ML training requires vast quantities of high&#8208;quality experimental data as input. Non&#8208;absorbable oral drugs (NODs) have unique safety advantage for chronic diseases due to their zero systemic exposure, but their empirical discovery is still time&#8208;consuming and costly. Here, a synergistic ML method, integrating small data&#8208;driven multi&#8208;layer unsupervised learning, in silico quantum&#8208;mechanical computations, and minimal wet&#8208;lab experiments is devised to identify the finest NODs from massive inorganic materials to achieve multi&#8208;objective function (high selectivity, large capacity, and stability). Based on this method, a NH4&#8208;form nanoporous zeolite with merlinoite (MER) framework (NH4&#8208;MER) is discovered for the treatment of hyperkalemia. In three different animal models, NH4&#8208;MER shows a superior safety and efficacy profile in reducing blood K+ without Na+ release, which is an unmet clinical need in chronic kidney disease and Gordon's syndrome. This work provides a synergistic ML method to accelerate the discovery of NODs and other shape&#8208;selective materials.

         <title>Thiosalicylic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Mediated Coordination Structure of Nickel Center via Thermodynamic Modulation for Aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is based on a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy to design nickel&#8208;based complexes with structural changes through thermodynamic modulation. Thiols induce electron&#8208;rich nickel structures around the competitive coordination between the host/guest molecules, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The work provides a new perspective on coordination transformations and offers ideas for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.








Abstract
Uniquely functional nanocomplexes with rich coordination environments are critical in energy storage. However, the construction of structurally versatile nanocomplexes remains challenging. In this study, a nickel&#8208;based complex with structural variations is designed via thermodynamic modulation using a dual&#8208;ligand synthesis strategy. A nickel&#8208;based nanomaterial (NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160) with a large specific surface area is synthesized around the competing coordination of the host and guest molecules that differ in terms of the chemical properties of the O and S elements. Concurrently, the coordination environment of NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160 is investigated via X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The thiol functional groups synergistically induced an electron&#8208;rich Ni structure, thus increasing the electron density of the central atom. The electrochemical performance of an assembled NiSA&#8208;SSA&#8208;160//Zn@CC battery is shown to improve significantly, with a maximum energy density of 0.54 mWh cm&#8722;2 and a peak power density of 49.49&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. This study provides a new perspective regarding coordination transformations and offers an idea for the design of functionally rich nanomaterials.

         <title>Intrinsic Grain Boundary Structure and Enhanced Defect States in Air&#8208;Sensitive Polycrystalline 1T&#8217;&#8208;WTe2 Monolayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Monolayer WTe2 has attracted significant attention for its unconventional superconductivity and topological edge states. However, its air sensitivity poses challenges for studying intrinsic defect structures. In this study, we address this issue using a custom&#8208;built inert gas interconnected system, and investigate the intrinsic grain boundary (GB) structures of monolayer polycrystalline 1T&#8217; WTe2 grown by nucleation&#8208;controlled chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Our findings reveal that GBs in this system are predominantly governed by W&#8208;Te rhombi with saturated coordination, resulting in three specific GB prototypes without dislocation cores. The GBs exhibit anisotropic orientations influenced by kinks formed from these fundamental units, which in turn affect the distribution of grains in various shapes within polycrystalline flakes. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) analysis further reveals metallic states along the intrinsic 120&#176; twin grain boundary (TGB), consistent with computed band structures. This systematic exploration of GBs in air&#8208;sensitive 1T&#8217; WTe2 monolayers provides valuable insights into emerging GB&#8208;related phenomena.

         <title>DNA Framework&#8208;Enabled Three Dimensional Organization of Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pre&#8208;organizing molecular drug within a microenvironment is crucial for the development of efficient and controllable therapeutic systems. Here, we report the use of tetrahedral DNA framework (TDF) to pre&#8208;organize antiarrhythmic drugs (herein doxorubicin, Dox) in three dimensions for catheter ablation, a minimally invasive treatment for fast heartbeats, aiming to address potential complications linked to collateral tissue damage and the post&#8208;ablation AF recurrence resulting from incomplete ablation. Dox pre&#8208;organization within TDF transforms its random distribution into a confined, regular spatial arrangement governed by DNA. This, combined with the high affinity between Dox and DNA, significantly increases local Dox concentration. The exceptional capacity of TDF for cellular internalization leads to a 5.5&#8208;fold increase in intracellular Dox amount within cardiomyocytes, effectively promoting cellular apoptosis. In vivo investigations demonstrate that administering TDF&#8208;Dox reduce the recurrence rate of electrical conduction after radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) to 37.5%, compared with the 77.8% recurrence rate in the free Dox&#8208;treated group. Notably, the employed Dox dosage exhibits negligible adverse effects in vivo. This study presents a promising treatment paradigm that strengthens the efficacy of catheter ablation and opens a new avenue for reconciling the paradox of ablation efficacy and collateral damage.

         <title>Grooved Microneedle Patch Augments Adoptive T Cell Therapy Against Solid Tumors via Diverting Regulatory T Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) for the treatment of solid tumors remains challenging. In addition to the poor infiltration of effector T (Teff) cells limited by the physical barrier surrounding the solid tumor, another major obstacle is the extensive infiltration of regulatory T (Treg) cells, a major immunosuppressive immune cell subset, in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we developed a grooved microneedle patch for augmenting ACT, aiming to simultaneously overcome physical and immunosuppressive barriers. The microneedles are engineered through an ice&#8208;templated method to generate the grooved structure for sufficient T&#8208;cell loading. In addition, with the surface modification of chemokine CCL22, the MNs could not only directly deliver tumor&#8208;specific T cells into solid tumors through physical penetration, but also specifically divert Treg cells from the tumor microenvironment to the surface of the microneedles via a cytokine concentration gradient, leading to an increase in the ratio of Teff cells/Treg cells in a mouse melanoma model. Consequently, this local delivery strategy of both T cell receptor T cells or chimeric antigen receptor T cells via the CCL22&#8208;modified grooved microneedles as a local niche could significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy and reduce on&#8208;target off&#8208;tumor toxicity of ACT.

         <title>Photopolymerization Approach to Advanced Polymer Composites: Integration of Surface&#8208;Modified Nanofillers for Enhanced Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The incorporation of functionalized nanofillers into polymers via photopolymerization approach has gained significant attention in recent years due to the unique properties of the resulting composite materials. Surface modification of nanofillers plays a crucial role in their compatibility and polymerization behavior within the polymer matrix during photopolymerization. This review focuses on the recent developments in surface modification of various nanofillers, enabling their integration into polymer systems through photopolymerization. The article discusses the key aspects of surface modification of nanofillers, including the selection of suitable surface modifiers, such as photoinitiators and polymerizable groups, as well as the optimization of modification conditions to achieve desired surface properties. The influence of surface modification on the interfacial interactions between nanofillers and the polymer matrix is also explored, as it directly impacts the final properties of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, the review highlights the applications of nanocomposites prepared by photopolymerization, such as sensors, gas separation membranes, purification systems, optical devices, and biomedical materials. By providing a comprehensive overview of the surface modification strategies and their impact on the photopolymerization process and the resulting nanocomposite properties, this review aims to inspire new research directions and innovative ideas in the development of high&#8208;performance polymer nanocomposites for diverse applications.

Surface modification of nanofillers plays a crucial role in their compatibility and polymerization behavior within the polymer matrix during photopolymerization. This review focuses on the recent developments in surface modification of various nanofillers, enabling their integration into polymer systems through photopolymerization. The article discusses the key aspects of surface modification of nanofillers, including the selection of suitable surface modifiers, such as photoinitiators and polymerizable groups, as well as the optimization of modification conditions to achieve desired surface properties. The influence of surface modification on the interfacial interactions between nanofillers and the polymer matrix is also explored, as it directly impacts the final properties of the nanocomposites. Furthermore, the review highlights the applications of nanocomposites prepared by photopolymerization, such as sensors, gas separation membranes, purification systems, optical devices, and biomedical materials. By providing a comprehensive overview of the surface modification strategies and their impact on the photopolymerization process and the resulting nanocomposite properties, this review aims to inspire new research directions and innovative ideas in the development of high-performance polymer nanocomposites for diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Graphene Oxide Films Expand Functionality of Photonic Chips</title>

Abstract
On&#8208;chip integration of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with unique structures and properties endow integrated devices with new functionalities and improved performance. With high flexibility in ways to modify its properties and compatibility with integrated platforms, graphene oxide (GO) is an exceptionally attractive 2D material for hybrid integrated photonic chips. Here, we demonstrate novel functionalities beyond the capability of photonic integrated circuits, by harnessing unique property changes induced by photo&#8208;thermal effects in 2D GO films. These include all&#8208;optical control and tuning, optical power limiting, and non&#8208;reciprocal light transmission. The 2D layered GO films are integrated onto photonic chips with precise control of their thickness and size. Benefitting from the broadband optical response of 2D GO films, all three functionalities feature a very wide operational optical bandwidth. By fitting the experimental results with theory, we analyze the changes in GO film properties induced by the photo&#8208;thermal effects, revealing interesting insights about the physics of 2D GO films. These results highlight the versatility of 2D GO films in implementing new functions for integrated photonic devices for a wide range of applications.

Abstract
The recent success of gene therapy during the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective and safe delivery systems. Complementing lipid&#8208;based delivery systems, polymers present a promising alternative for gene delivery. Significant advances have been made in the recent past, with multiple clinical trials progressing beyond phase I and several companies actively working on polymeric delivery systems which provides assurance that polymeric carriers can soon achieve clinical translation. The massive advantage of structural tunability and vast chemical space of polymers is being actively leveraged to mitigate shortcomings of traditional polycationic polymers and improve the translatability of delivery systems. Tailored polymeric approaches for diverse nucleic acids and for specific subcellular targets are now being designed to improve therapeutic efficacy. This review describes the recent advances in polymer design for improved gene delivery by polyplexes and covalent polymer&#8208;nucleic acid conjugates. The review also offers a brief note on novel computational techniques for improved polymer design. We conclude with an overview of the current state of polymeric gene therapies in the clinic as well as future directions on their translation to the clinic.

         <title>Propelling Minimally Invasive Tissue Regeneration with Next&#8208;Era Injectable Pre&#8208;Formed Scaffolds</title>

Abstract
The growing aging population, with its associated chronic diseases, underscores the urgency for effective tissue regeneration strategies. Biomaterials have played a pivotal role in the realm of tissue reconstruction and regeneration, with a distinct shift towards minimally invasive (MI) treatments. This transition, fueled by engineered biomaterials, has steered away from invasive surgical procedures to embrace approaches offering reduced trauma, accelerated recovery, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. In the realm of MI tissue repair and cargo delivery, various techniques have been explored. While in situ polymerization has been prominent, it is not without its challenges. This narrative review explores diverse biomaterials, fabrication methods, and biofunctionalization for injectable pre&#8208;formed scaffolds, focusing on their unique advantages. The injectable pre&#8208;formed scaffolds, exhibiting compressibility, controlled injection, and maintained mechanical integrity, emerge as promising alternative solutions to in situ polymerization challenges. The conclusion of this review emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary design facilitated by synergizing fields of materials science, advanced 3D biomanufacturing, and mechanobiological studies, and innovative approaches for effective MI tissue regeneration.

         <title>Needle&#8208;like Multifunctional Biphasic Microfiber for Minimally Invasive Implantable Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implantable bioelectronics has attracted significant attention in electroceuticals and clinical medicine for precise diagnosis and efficient treatment of target diseases. However, conventional rigid implantable devices face challenges such as poor tissue&#8208;device interface and unavoidable tissue damage during surgical implantation. Despite continuous efforts to utilize various soft materials to address such issues, their practical applications remain limited. Here, we report a needle&#8208;like stretchable microfiber composed of a phase&#8208;convertible liquid metal (LM) core and a multifunctional nanocomposite shell for minimally invasive soft bioelectronics. The sharp tapered microfiber can be stiffened by freezing akin to a conventional needle to penetrate soft tissue with minimal incision. Once implanted in vivo where the LM melts, unlike conventional stiff needles, it regains soft mechanical properties, which facilitate a seamless tissue&#8208;device interface. The nanocomposite incorporating with functional nanomaterials exhibits both low impedance and the ability to detect physiological pH, providing biosensing and stimulation capabilities. The fluidic liquid metal embedded in the nanocomposite shell enables high stretchability and strain&#8208;insensitive electrical properties. This multifunctional biphasic microfiber conforms to the surfaces of the stomach, muscle, and heart, offering a promising approach for electrophysiological recording, pH sensing, electrical stimulation, and radiofrequency ablation in vivo.

         <title>Direct Electroplating Ruthenium Precursor on the Surface Oxidized Nickel Foam for Efficient and Stable Bifunctional Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water electrolysis to produce hydrogen (H2) using renewable energy is one of the most promising candidates for realizing carbon neutrality, but its reaction kinetics are hindered by the sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ruthenium (Ru) in its high&#8208;valence state (oxide) provides one of the most active OER sites, and is less costly, but it is thermodynamically unstable. We leveraged the strong interaction between Ru nanoparticles (NPs) and nickel hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) to directly form Ru&#8208;Ni(OH)2 on the surface of a porous nickel foam (NF) electrode via a spontaneous galvanic replacement reaction. The formation of Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Ni bonds at the interface of the Ru NPs and Ni(OH)2 (Ru&#8208;Ni(OH)2) on the surface oxidized NF significantly enhanced the stability of the Ru&#8208;Ni(OH)2/NF electrode. In addition to OER, the catalyst was active enough for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As a result, it was able to deliver overpotentials of 228 and 15&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER and HER, respectively. An industry&#8208;scale evaluation using Ru&#8208;Ni(OH)2/NF as both OER and HER electrodes demonstrated a high current density of 1500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 (OER: 410&#160;mV; HER: 240&#160;mV), surpassing commercial RuO2 (OER: 600&#160;mV) and Pt/C based performance (HER: 265&#160;mV).

         <title>Discovering Pyramidal Treasures: Multi&#8208;scale Design of High Strength&#8208;Ductility Titanium Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mechanical properties of titanium alloys, one of humankind's most essential structural materials, suffer from the lack of &#12296;c + a&#12297; dislocations on pyramidal slip planes, failing homogeneous plastic strain accommodation. This mechanical treasure is not easily accessible in titanium alloys because of the required excessively high stress levels. The present work demonstrates that such a dilemma may be overcome by meticulously tuning the c/a ratio, the simplest crystallographic parameter of the hexagonal close&#8208;packed lattice, through Sn alloying. Combing this lattice&#8208;scale design concept with a cross&#8208;rolling based polycrystal&#8208;scale design solution, this study showcases a facile route to bimodal (&#945;+&#946;) titanium alloys with unprecedented strength&#8208;ductility synergy.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanical properties of titanium alloys, one of humankind's most essential structural materials, suffer from the lack of &#12296;&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt; + &lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;&#12297; dislocations on pyramidal slip planes, failing homogeneous plastic strain accommodation. This mechanical treasure is not easily accessible in titanium alloys because of the required excessively high stress levels. The present work demonstrates that such a dilemma may be overcome by meticulously tuning the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; ratio, the simplest crystallographic parameter of the hexagonal close-packed lattice, through Sn alloying. Combing this lattice-scale design concept with a cross-rolling based polycrystal-scale design solution, this study showcases a facile route to bimodal (&#945;+&#946;) titanium alloys with unprecedented strength-ductility synergy.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Electromechanically Reconfigurable Terahertz Stereo Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The massive strain change associated with the phase transition in VO2 is harnessed to achieve structurally reconfigurable metadevices that can be reversibly switched between 3D and planar geometries. Accessing the third dimension with complete dynamic control holds the potential to unlock exotic light&#8211;matter interactions, paving the way for novel and high&#8208;performance electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Dynamic terahertz devices are vital for the next generation of wireless communication, sensing, and non&#8208;destructive imaging technologies. Metasurfaces have emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shifting platform, offering varied functionalities, miniaturization, and simplified fabrication compared to their 3D counterparts. However, the presence of in&#8208;plane mirror symmetry and reduced degree of freedom impose fundamental limitations on achieving advanced chiral response, beamforming, and reconfiguration capabilities. In this work, a platform composed of electrically actuated resonators that can be colossally reconfigured between planar and 3D geometries is demonstrated. To illustrate the platform, metadevices with 3D Split Ring Resonators are fabricated, wherein two counteracting driving forces are combined: i) folding induced by stress mismatch, which enables non&#8208;volatile state design and ii) unfolding triggered by the strain associated with insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition in VO2, which facilitates volatile structural reconfiguration. This large structural reconfiguration space allows for resonance mode switching, widely tunable magnetic and electric polarizabilities, and increased frequency agility. Moreover, the unique properties of VO2, such as the hysteretic nature of its phase transition is harnessed to demonstrate a multi&#8208;state memory. Therefore, these VO2 integrated metadevices are highly attractive for the realization of 6G communication devices such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, holographic beam formers, and spatial light modulators.

         <title>Visualizing Phase Evolution of Co2C for Efficient Fischer&#8208;Tropsch to Olefins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cobalt carbide (Co2C) possesses high catalytic efficiency Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis (FTS) while the products selectivity appears sensitive to crystallography geometry. Since the Anderson&#8211;Schulz&#8211;Flory (ASF) distribution in FTS was broken through fabricating facetted Co2C nanocrystals, yet the underlying mechanism of Co2C crystallization remains unclarified suffering from sophisticated catalyst composition involving promoter agents. Herein, we report the synthesis of high&#8208;purity single&#8208;crystal nanoprisms (Co2C&#8208;p) for highly efficient FTS to lower olefins. Through comprehensive microstructure analysis, e.g. high&#8208;resolution TEM, in situ TEM and electron diffraction, as well as finite element simulation of gas flow field, for the first time we disclosed the full roadmap of forming catalytic active cobalt carbides, starting from reduction of Co3O4 precursor to CoO intermediate, then carburization into Co2C&#8208;s and subsequent ripening growth into Co2C&#8208;p. This gas&#8208;induced engineering of crystal phase provides a new synthesis strategy, with many new possibilities for precise design of metal&#8208;based catalyst for diverse catalytic applications.

         <title>Optically Actuated Soft Microrobot Family for Single&#8208;Cell Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel family of cell manipulators is presented, which are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold single, nonadherent cells. The structures, prepared with multiphoton polymerization, provide high spatial and temporal control over the manipulation of the cells enabling single cell movement with 6&#176; of freedom and cell&#8211;cell interactions.








Abstract
Precisely controlled manipulation of nonadherent single cells is often a pre&#8208;requisite for their detailed investigation. Optical trapping provides a versatile means for positioning cells with submicrometer precision or measuring forces with femto&#8208;Newton resolution. A variant of the technique, called indirect optical trapping, enables single&#8208;cell manipulation with no photodamage and superior spatial control and stability by relying on optically trapped microtools biochemically bound to the cell. High&#8208;resolution 3D lithography enables to prepare such cell manipulators with any predefined shape, greatly extending the number of achievable manipulation tasks. Here, it is presented for the first time a novel family of cell manipulators that are deformable by optical tweezers and rely on their elasticity to hold cells. This provides a more straightforward approach to indirect optical trapping by avoiding biochemical functionalization for cell attachment, and consequently by enabling the manipulated cells to be released at any time. Using the photoresist Ormocomp, the deformations achievable with optical forces in the tens of pN range and present three modes of single&#8208;cell manipulation as examples to showcase the possible applications such soft microrobotic tools can offer are characterized. The applications describe here include cell collection, 3D cell imaging, and spatially and temporally controlled cell&#8211;cell interaction.

         <title>Adaptive Processing Enabled by Sodium Alginate Based Complementary Memristor for Neuromorphic Sensory System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity are biorealistically demonstated in Ag nanowire (NW)&#8208;embedded sodium alginate (SA) based complementary memristor. The scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are reproduced for image enhancement under dark and bright backgrounds. The neuromorphic sensory system (NSS) with multisensory integration function is demonstrated, in which the accuracy of pattern recognition can be obviously enhanced.








Abstract
Adaptive processing allows sensory systems to autonomically adjust their sensitivity with exposure to a constant sensory stimulus and thus organisms to adapt to environmental variations. Bioinspired&#160;electronics with adaptive functions are highly desirable for the development of neuromorphic sensory systems (NSSs). Herein, the functions of desensitization and sensitivity changing with background intensity (i.e., Weber's law), as two fundamental cues of sensory adaptation, are biorealistically demonstrated in an Ag nanowire (NW)&#8208;embedded sodium alginate (SA) based complementary memristor. In particular, Weber's law is experimentally emulated in a single complementary memristor. Furthermore, three types of adaptive NSS unit are constructed to realize a multiple perceptual capability that processes the stimuli of illuminance, temperature, and pressure signals. Taking neuromorphic vision as an example, scotopic and photopic adaptation functions are well reproduced for image enhancement against dark and bright backgrounds. Importantly, an NSS system with multisensory integration function is demonstrated by combining light and pressure spikes, where the accuracy of pattern recognition is obviously enhanced relative to that of an individual sense. This work offers a new strategy for developing neuromorphic electronics with adaptive functions and paves the way toward developing a highly efficient NSS.

         <title>Plasma Coupled Electrolyte Additive Strategy for Construction of High&#8208;Performance Solid Electrolyte Interphase on Li Metal Anodes</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance lithium metal anodes are crucial for the development of advanced Li metal batteries. Herein, we report a novel plasma coupled electrolyte additive strategy to prepare high&#8208;quality composite solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Li metal to achieve enhanced performance and stability. With the guidance of calculations, we select diethyl dibromomalonate (DB) as an additive to optimize the solvation structure of electrolytes to modify the SEI. Meanwhile, we groundbreakingly develop DB plasma technology coupled with DB electrolyte additive to construct a combinatorial SEI: inner plasma&#8208;induced SEI layer composed of LiBr and Li2CO3 plus additive&#8208;reduced SEI containing LiBr/Li2CO3/organic lithium compounds as an outer compatible layer. The optimized hybrid SEI has strong affinity toward Li+ and good mechanical properties, thereby inducing horizontal dispersion and uniform deposition of Li+ and keep structure stable. Accordingly, the symmetrical cells exhibit enhanced cycling stability for 1200&#160;h at an overpotential of 23.8&#160;mV with average coulombic efficiency (99.51%). Additionally, the full cells with LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode deliver a capacity retention of 81.7% after 300 cycles at 0.5 C, and the pouch cell achieves a volumetric specific energy of &#8764;664&#160;Wh L&#8210;1. This work provides new enlightenment on plasma technology for fabrication of advanced metal anodes for energy storage.

         <title>Designer Anions for Better Rechargeable Lithium Batteries and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Non&#8208;aqueous electrolytes, generally consisting of metal salts and solvating media, are indispensable elements for building rechargeable batteries. As the major sources of ionic charges, the intrinsic characters of salt anions are of particular importance in determining the fundamental properties of bulk electrolyte, as well as the features of the resulting electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphases/interfaces. To cope with the increasing demand for better rechargeable batteries requested by emerging application domains, the structural design and modifications of salt anions are highly desired. Here, salt anions for lithium and other monovalent (e.g., sodium and potassium) and multivalent (e.g., magnesium, calcium, zinc, and aluminum) rechargeable batteries are outlined. Fundamental considerations on the design of salt anions are provided, particularly involving specific requirements imposed by different cell chemistries. Historical evolution and possible synthetic methodologies for metal salts with representative salt anions are reviewed. Recent advances in tailoring the anionic structures for rechargeable batteries are scrutinized, and due attention is paid to the paradigm shift from liquid to solid electrolytes, from intercalation to conversion/alloying&#8208;type electrodes, from lithium to other kinds of rechargeable batteries. The remaining challenges and key research directions in the development of robust salt anions are also discussed.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Phosphorus Trichalcogenides for Rapid Sodium Ion Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy strategies have been regarded as a powerful means to confer desirable and enhanced functionalities in energy storage fields. The improved properties are invariably ascribed to entropy stabilization or synergistic cocktail effect. Therefore, the manifested properties in such disordered multicomponent materials are usually unpredictable. Elucidating the precise correlations between atomic structures and properties remains a challenge in high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs). Herein, we combine atomic&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy annular dark field (STEM&#8208;ADF) imaging and four dimensions (4D)&#8208;STEM to directly visualize atomic&#8208;scale structural and electric information in high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3. We found aperiodic stacking in FeMnNiVZnPS3 accompanied by high&#8208;density strain soliton boundaries (SSBs). Theoretical calculation suggests that the formation of such structures is attributed to the imbalanced stress of distinct metal&#8208;sulfur bonds in multi&#8208;element systems. Interestingly, the electric field concentrates along the two sides of interface regions and gradually diminishes towards the two&#8208;dimensional plane to generate unique electric field gradient, strongly promoting the ion diffusion rate. Accordingly, high&#8208;entropy FeMnNiVZnPS3 demonstrates superior ion&#8208;diffusion coefficients of 10&#8722;9.7&#8208;10&#8722;8.3 cm2 s&#8722;1 and high&#8208;rate performance (311.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 A g&#8722;1). This work provides an alternative way for the atomic&#8208;scale understanding and design of sophisticated HEMs, paving the way for property engineering in complex multi&#8208;component materials.

         <title>Intrinsic Elastomer with Remarkable Dielectric Constant via Elastification of Relaxor Ferroelectric Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant elastomers have always been playing a critical role in the development of wearable electronics for actuation, energy storage, and sensing; therefore, there is an urgent need for effective strategies to enhance dielectric constants. The present methods mainly involve adding inorganic or conductive fillers to the polymer elastomers, however, the addition of fillers will cause a series of problems, such as large dielectric loss, increased modulus, and deteriorating interface conditions. Here we investigate the elastification of relaxor ferroelectric polymers through slight crosslinking, aiming to obtain intrinsic elastomers with high dielectric constants. By crosslinking of the relaxor ferroelectric polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE&#8208;CFE) with a long soft chain crosslinker, we obtain a relaxor ferroelectric elastomer with an enhanced dielectric constant, twice that of the pristine relaxor ferroelectric polymer and surpassing all reported intrinsic elastomers. This elastomer maintains its high dielectric constant over a wide temperature range and exhibits robust mechanical fatigue resistance, chemical stability and thermal stability. Moreover, the ferroelectricity of the elastomer remains stable under strains up to 80%. Our study offers a simple and effective way to enhance the dielectric constant of intrinsic elastomers, thus facilitating advancements in soft robots, biosensors, and wearable electronics.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Fabrication of Stable Silicon Anode in Air for Sulfide Solid State Batteries via Ionic&#8208;Electronic Dual Conductive Binder</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The construction of a continuous ionic/electronic pathway is critical for Si&#8208;based sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with the advantages of high&#8208;energy density and high&#8208;cycle stability. However, a significant impediment arises from the parasitic reaction occurring between the ionic sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte (S&#8208;SE) and electronic carbon additive, posing a formidable challenge. Additionally, the fabrication of electrodes necessitates stringent operational conditions, further limiting practical applicability. Herein, we report an ionic&#8208;electronic dual conductive binder for the fabrication of robust silicon anode under ambient air conditions in the absence of high&#8208;cost and air&#8208;sensitive S&#8208;SE for ASSBs. This binder incorporates in&#8208;situ reduced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into a high&#8208;strength polymer rich in ether bonds, establishing a conductive pathway for lithium ions and electrons. With the binder&#8208;composited Si anode, the half&#8208;cell exhibits a remarkable capacity of 1906.9 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling for 500 cycles at a current density of 2 C (4.4&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under a low stack pressure of 5&#160;MPa. The full cell using Ni0.9Co0.075Mn0.025O2 (NCM90) exhibits a remark cycling stability within 2,000 cycles at 5&#8201;C (8&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2). This work presents an inspired design of functional binders for large&#8208;scale manufacture and mild operation in a low&#8208;cost way for Si anodes in ASSBs.

&lt;p&gt;The construction of a continuous ionic/electronic pathway is critical for Si-based sulfide all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) with the advantages of high-energy density and high-cycle stability. However, a significant impediment arises from the parasitic reaction occurring between the ionic sulfide solid-state electrolyte (S-SE) and electronic carbon additive, posing a formidable challenge. Additionally, the fabrication of electrodes necessitates stringent operational conditions, further limiting practical applicability. Herein, we report an ionic-electronic dual conductive binder for the fabrication of robust silicon anode under ambient air conditions in the absence of high-cost and air-sensitive S-SE for ASSBs. This binder incorporates in-situ reduced silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into a high-strength polymer rich in ether bonds, establishing a conductive pathway for lithium ions and electrons. With the binder-composited Si anode, the half-cell exhibits a remarkable capacity of 1906.9 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and stable cycling for 500 cycles at a current density of 2 C (4.4&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under a low stack pressure of 5&#160;MPa.

This study introduces an advanced molecular ferroelectric with amalgamation of two symmetric phases (phase &#945; and phase &#947;). The mixing profile, as unveiled by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) polarimetry, is predominantly at the nanoscale, as opposed to mixed grains. The transition process between the two symmetric phases is facilitated through the application of an external electrical field.








Abstract
Anatomizing mixed&#8208;phases, referring to analyzing the mixing profiles and quantifying the phases&#8217; proportions in a material, which is of great significance in the genuine applications. Here, by using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG)&#160;polarimetry and piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques, this work elucidates the contributions and distributions of two different symmetric phases mixed in an archetype monoaxial molecular ferroelectric, diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPACl). The two competing phases are preferred in thermodynamics or kinetic process respectively, and this work evidences the switching behavior between the two competing phases facilitated by an external electrical field as opposed to a heating process. This research contributes novel insights into phase engineering in the field of molecular ferroelectrics and is poised to serve as a potent analytical tool for subsequent applications.
