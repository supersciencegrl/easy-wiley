         <title>Colossal Optical Anisotropy from Atomic&#8208;Scale Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subtle atomic&#8208;scale structural modulations of a crystal can dramatically change its optical properties. Single&#8208;crystal plates of modulated quasi&#8208;1D chalcogenide Sr9/8TiS3 are shown to have a record in&#8208;plane birefringence &#916;n = ne &#8722; no = 2.1 (ne = 4.5,&#8197;no = 2.4) within a broad transparent window in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. Structural modulation will be a new tool in realizing materials with large degrees of optical and optoelectronic anisotropy.








Abstract
Materials with large birefringence (&#916;n, where n is the refractive index) are sought after for polarization control (e.g., in wave plates, polarizing beam splitters, etc.), nonlinear optics, micromanipulation, and as a platform for unconventional light&#8211;matter coupling, such as hyperbolic phonon polaritons. Layered 2D&#160;materials can feature some of the largest optical anisotropy; however, their use in most optical systems is limited because their optical axis is out of the plane of the layers and the layers are weakly attached. This work demonstrates that a bulk crystal with subtle periodic modulations in its structure&#8212;Sr9/8TiS3&#8212;is transparent and positive&#8208;uniaxial, with extraordinary index ne = 4.5 and ordinary index no = 2.4 in the mid&#8208; to far&#8208;infrared. The excess Sr, compared to stoichiometric SrTiS3, results in the formation of TiS6 trigonal&#8208;prismatic units that break the chains of face&#8208;sharing TiS6 octahedra in SrTiS3 into periodic blocks of five TiS6 octahedral units. The additional electrons introduced by the excess Sr form highly oriented electron clouds, which selectively boost the extraordinary index ne and result in record birefringence (&#916;n &gt; 2.1 with low loss). The connection between subtle structural modulations and large changes in refractive index suggests new categories of anisotropic materials and also tunable optical materials with large refractive&#8208;index modulation.

         <title>Structurally&#8208;Distorted RuIr&#8208;Based Nanoframes for Long&#8208;Duration Oxygen Evolution Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structurally&#8208;distorted CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with twisted Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8211;M (M = Ru, Ir) are successfully constructed via cation exchange and sequential thermal treatment, which can be used as ultra&#8208;active and ultra&#8208;stable acidic OER catalyst due to the strong synergy between Ru and Ir.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a key role in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), yet the electrocatalysts still suffer from the disadvantages of low activity and poor stability in acidic conditions. Here, a new class of CdRu2IrOx nanoframes with distorted structure for acidic OER is successfully fabricated. Impressively, CdRu2IrOx displays an ultralow overpotential of 189&#160;mV and an ultralong stability of 1500&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 toward OER in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. Moreover, a PEMWE using the distorted CdRu2IrOx can be steadily operated at 0.1 A cm&#8315;2 for 90&#160;h. Microstructural analyses and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) demonstrate that the synergy between Ru and Ir in CdRu2IrOx induces the distortion of Ru&#8722;O, Ir&#8722;O, and Ru&#8722;M (M = Ru, Ir) bonds. In situ XAS indicates that the applied potential leads to the deformation octahedral structure of RuOx/IrOx and the formation of stable Ru5+ species for OER. Theoretical calculations also reveal that the distorted structures can reduce the energy barrier of rate&#8208;limiting step during OER. This work provides an efficient strategy for constructing structural distortion to achieve significant enhancement on the activity and stability of OER catalysts.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Touch Device with Two Terminals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the integration of resistor and capacitor elements with material composition gradients, 3D touch detection is enabled with only two terminal electrodes. Unlike conventional crossbar arrays, this approach provides full 3D input capability without being limited by wiring complexity. The measurement system represents a groundbreaking approach to simplifying the input device architecture to achieve large&#8208;area high resolution.








Abstract
A crossbar array is an essential element that determines the operating position and simplifies the structure of devices. However, in the crossbar array, wiring numerous electrodes to address many positions poses significant challenges. In this study, a method is proposed that utilizes only two electrodes to determine multiple positions. The method significantly simplifies the wiring and device fabrication process. Instead of defining the node location of the crossbar, it is experimentally demonstrated that the x&#8211;y&#8211;z coordinates can be determined from i) the resistance change as a function of distance, ii) the resistance variation influenced by the electrode composition, and iii) capacitance fluctuation resulting from changes in the dielectric thickness. By employing two&#8208;terminal transparent electrodes, a fully functional 3D touch device is successfully fabricated, introducing a groundbreaking approach to simplify input device architectures.

         <title>Hemoperfusion Adsorbents for Removal of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure: Recent Progress, Challenges, and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver and kidney failure leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxin, and creatinine in the blood and tissues, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins by extracorporeal system. Carbon materials, zeolites, MXenes, polymer materials, composite materials, porous materials, etc. have been developed as hemoperfusion adsorbents to remove common toxins in liver and kidney failure and to treat liver and kidney failure.








Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorbents with improved adsorption performance and good blood compatibility have been developed. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the adsorption mechanisms of toxins are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

A comprehensive overview of the emerging perovskite&#8208;solar&#8208;cell&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical device, including the configuration design, key parameters, working principle, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations, is highlighted. The existing challenges and future perspectives are provided for the ongoing research in this promising field.








Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilization, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilization. In addition, the energy conversion&#8211;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. Here, focus is on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSC&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. The advanced progresses in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations are also summarized. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

         <title>Self&#8208;Construction of Efficient Interfaces Ensures High&#8208;Performance Direct Ammonia Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;structured NiFe and NiCu&#8208;decorated interfaces on the anode surface via the attachment of the reduced Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; anode catalytic layer onto the Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; anode can dramatically enhance the catalytic activity for NH3 decomposition and durability of direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells.








Abstract
Direct ammonia protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) are highly efficient energy conversion devices since ammonia as a carbon&#8208;neutral hydrogen&#8208;rich carrier shows great potential for storage and long&#8208;distance transportation when compared with hydrogen fuel. However, traditional Ni&#8208;based anodes readily suffer from severe structural destruction and dramatic deactivation after long&#8208;time exposure to ammonia. Here a Sr2Fe1.35Mo0.45Cu0.2O6&#8722;&#948; (SFMC) anode catalytic layer (ACL) painted onto a Ni&#8208;BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.1Yb0.1O3&#8722;&#948; (BZCYYb) anode with enhanced catalytic activity and durability toward the direct utilization of ammonia is reported. A tubular Ni&#8208;BZCYYb anode&#8208;supported cells with the SFMC ACL show excellent peak power densities of 1.77 W cm&#8722;2 in wet H2 (3% H2O) and 1.02 W cm&#8722;2 in NH3 at 650 &#176;C. A relatively stable operation of the cells is obtained at 650 &#176;C for 200 h in ammonia fuel. Such achieved improvements in the activity and durability are attributed to the self&#8208;constructed interfaces with the phases of NiCu or/and NiFe for efficient NH3 decomposition, resulting in a strong NH3 adsorption strength of the SFMC, as confirmed by NH3 thermal conversion and NH3&#8208;temperature programmed desorption. This research offers a valuable strategy of applying an internal catalytic layer for highly active and durable ammonia PCFCs.

         <title>Non&#8208;Pore Dependent and MMP&#8208;9 Responsive Gelatin/Silk Fibroin Composite Microparticles as Universal Delivery Platform for Inhaled Treatment of Lung Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GSC with adjusted particle sizes is fabricated through the microphase separation of gelatin (Gel) /silk fibroin (SF) systems and following desolvation process. This work specifically selects GSC with a diameter of 3 &#181;m as carriers for various drugs including small molecule chemotherapeutics, large protein drugs, and nucleic acid drugs for noninvasive aerosol inhalation therapy for lung cancer.








Abstract
Developing a drug delivery platform that possesses universal drug loading capacity to meet various requirements of cancer treatment is a challenging yet interesting task. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled gelatin/silk fibroin composite (GSC) particle based drug delivery system is developed via microphase separation followed by desolvation process. Thanks to its preassembled microphase stage, this GSC system is suitable for varying types of drugs. The desolvation process fix drugs inside GSC rapidly and densify the GSC structure, thereby achieving efficient drug loading and providing comprehensive protection for loaded drugs. Actually, the size of this brand&#8208;new non&#8208;pore dependent drug delivery system can be easily adjusted from 100&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m to fit different scenarios. This work selects GSC with 3&#160;&#181;m diameter as the universal inhaled drug delivery platform, which shows an excellent transmucosal penetration and lung retention ability. Additionally, the MMP&#8208;9 sensitive degradation property of GSC enhances the targeted efficiency of drugs and reduces side effects. Intestinally, GSC can self&#8208;amplify the regulation of innate immunity to reverse the cancerous microenvironment into an antitumor niche, significantly improving the therapeutic effect of drugs. This study of GSC universal drug platform provides a new direction to develop the next&#8208;generation of drug delivery system for lung cancer.

         <title>Ultrafast and Controlled Capturing, Loading, and Release of Extracellular Vesicles by a Portable Microstructured Electrochemical Fluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable device that offers an &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip approach, capable of separating extracellular vesicles directly from biological fluids in a simple and efficient manner, while also allowing their subsequent manipulation, is reported. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by all living cells and are found in body fluids. They exert numerous physiological and pathological functions and serve as cargo shuttles. Due to their safety and inherent bioactivity, they have emerged as versatile therapeutic agents, biomarkers, and potential drug carriers. Despite the growing interest in EVs, current progress in this field is, in part, limited by relatively inefficient isolation techniques. Conventional methods are indeed slow, laborious, require specialized laboratory equipment, and may result in low yield and purity. This work describes an electrochemically controlled &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; device enabling capturing, loading, and releasing of EVs. The device is composed of a fluidic channel confined within antibody&#8208;coated microstructured electrodes. It rapidly isolates EVs with a high level of purity from various biofluids. As a proof of principle, the device is applied to isolate EVs from skin wounds of healthy and diabetic mice. Strikingly, it is found that EVs from healing wounds of diabetic mice are enriched in mitochondrial proteins compared to those of healthy mice. Additionally, the device improves the loading protocol of EVs with polyplexes, and may therefore find applications in nucleic acid delivery. Overall, the electrochemical device can greatly facilitate the development of EVs&#8208;based technologies.

         <title>Illuminating the Brain: Advances and Perspectives in Optoelectronics for Neural Activity Monitoring and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overview of the recent advances in implantable optoelectronics for neural activity monitoring and modulation is provided. Combining optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural network interface has gained momentum in recent years, and controlling the spatial coverage of illumination, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation.








Abstract
Optogenetic modulation of brain neural activity that combines optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural system has recently gained robust momentum. Controlling illumination spatial coverage, designing light&#8208;activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation. To this end, biocompatible electrodes with enhanced optoelectrical performance, device integration for multiplexed addressing, wireless transmission, and multimodal operation in soft systems have been developed. This review provides an outlook for uniformly illuminating large brain areas while spatiotemporally imaging the neural responses upon optoelectrical stimulation with little artifacts. Representative concepts and important breakthroughs, such as head&#8208;mounted illumination, multiple implanted optical fibers, and micro&#8208;light&#8208;delivery devices, are discussed. Examples of techniques that incorporate electrophysiological monitoring and optoelectrical stimulation are presented.

&lt;p&gt;An overview of the recent advances in implantable optoelectronics for neural activity monitoring and modulation is provided. Combining optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural network interface has gained momentum in recent years, and controlling the spatial coverage of illumination, designing light-activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic modulation of brain neural activity that combines optical and electrical modes in a unitary neural system has recently gained robust momentum. Controlling illumination spatial coverage, designing light-activated modulators, and developing wireless light delivery and data transmission are crucial for maximizing the use of optical neuromodulation. To this end, biocompatible electrodes with enhanced optoelectrical performance, device integration for multiplexed addressing, wireless transmission, and multimodal operation in soft systems have been developed. This review provides an outlook for uniformly illuminating large brain areas while spatiotemporally imaging the neural responses upon optoelectrical stimulation with little artifacts. Representative concepts and important breakthroughs, such as head-mounted illumination, multiple implanted optical fibers, and micro-light-delivery devices, are discussed. Examples of techniques that incorporate electrophysiological monitoring and optoelectrical stimulation are presented. Challenges and perspectives are posed for further research efforts toward high-density optoelectrical neural interface modulation, with the potential for nonpharmacological neurological disease treatments and wireless optoelectrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stabilization of Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells with a 2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson Passivating Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CsPbI3 perovskites suffers fast transfer to non&#8208;perovskite phase, especially exposed to humidity. Using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the 3D inorganic perovskite surface, the obtained 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance and higher temperature stability, resulting in improved efficiency and operational stability in solar cells.








Abstract
Inorganic metal halide perovskites such as CsPbI3 are promising for high&#8208;performance, reproducible, and robust solar cells. However, inorganic perovskites are sensitive to humidity, which causes the transformation from the black phase to the yellow &#948;, non&#8208;perovskite phase. Such phase instability has been a significant challenge to long&#8208;term operational stability. Here, a surface dimensionality reduction strategy is reported, using 2&#8208;(4&#8208;aminophenyl)ethylamine cation to construct a Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D phase that covers the surface of the 3D inorganic perovskite structure. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson layer mainly grows at the grain boundaries of the perovskite, effectively passivating surface defects and providing favourable interfacial charge transfer. The resulting inorganic perovskite films exhibit excellent humidity resistance when submerged in an aqueous solution (isopropanol:water = 4:1 v/v) and exposed to a 50% humidity air atmosphere. The Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D/3D inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.5% with a Voc of 1.197&#160;eV. It retains 83% of its initial PCE after 1260&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under 1.2 sun illumination. The work demonstrates an effective way for stabilizing efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Redox Triggers Guest Release and Uptake Across a Series of Azopyridine&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Capsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active azo groups are introduced in replacement of imine bonds that have been previously utilized to construct metal&#8211;organic capsules, endowing the capsules with reversible redox behaviors that can release guests upon reduction and re&#8208;capsulate them through oxidation. Since azo groups can attach to various ligand cores, this can potentially be a general approach to realize guest release and uptake via redox.








Abstract
Precise control over guest release and recapture using external stimuli is a valuable goal, potentially enabling new modes of chemical purification. Including redox moieties within the ligand cores of molecular capsules to trigger the release and uptake of guests has proved effective, but this technique is limited to certain capsules and guests. Herein, the construction of a series of novel metal&#8211;organic capsules from ditopic, tritopic, and tetratopic ligands is demonstrated, all of which contain redox&#8208;active azo groups coordinated to FeII centers. Compared to their iminopyridine&#8208;based analogs, this new class of azopyridine&#8208;based capsules possesses larger cavities, capable of encapsulating more voluminous guests. Upon reduction of the capsules, their guests are released and may then be re&#8208;encapsulated when the capsules are regenerated by oxidation. Since the redox centers are on the ligand arms, they are modular and can be attached to a variety of ligand cores to afford varying and predictable architectures. This method thus shows promise as a generalized approach for designing redox&#8208;controlled guest release and uptake systems.

         <title>Intrinsic Ferromagnetic Semiconductors with High Saturation Magnetization from Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of ferromagnetic semiconductor is obtained by exploiting the perovskite structure. The obtained (4ampy)CuCl4 exhibits a remarkably saturated magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1, which is one of the highest&#8208;ever&#8208;reported values for organic/inorganic hybrid intrinsic ferromagnetic semiconductors.








Abstract
Ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMS) enable simultaneous control of both charge and spin transport of charge carriers, and they have emerged as a class of highly desirable but rare materials for applications in spin field&#8208;effect transistors and quantum computing. Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites with high compositional adjustability and structural versatility can offer unique benefits in the design of FMS but has not been fully explored. Here, a series of molecular FMSs based on the 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite structure, namely (2ampy)CuCl4, (3ampy)CuCl4, and (4ampy)CuCl4, is demonstrated, which exhibits high saturation magnetization, dramatic temperature&#8208;dependent conductivity change, and tunable ferromagnetic resonance. Magnetic measurements reveal a high saturation magnetization up to 18.56 emu g&#8722;1 for (4ampy)CuCl4, which is one of the highest value among reported hybrid FMSs to date. Conductivity studies of the three FMSs demonstrate that the smaller adjacent octahedron distance in the 2D layer results in higher conductivity. Systematic ferromagnetic resonance investigation shows that the gyromagnetic ratio and Landau factor values are strongly dependent on the types of organic cations used. This work demonstrates that 2D hybrid perovskite materials can simultaneously possess both tunable long&#8208;range ferromagnetic ordering and semiconductivity, providing a straightforward strategy for designing and synthesizing high&#8208;performance intrinsic FMSs.

         <title>Conversion of Surface Residual Alkali to Solid Electrolyte to Enable Na&#8208;Ion Full Cells with Robust Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NaMgPO4 is used to modify the interface of the O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT) to reduce surface residual alkali and improve cycle performance. The excellent interface facilitates the transport of Na+ and reduces the dissolution of transition metals (TMs). A high discharge capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and a superior stability under the 4.3 V cutoff voltage are obtained successfully in assembled full cells.








Abstract
The deposition of volatilized Na+ on the surface of the cathode during sintering results in the formation of surface residual alkali (NaOH/Na2CO3NaHCO3) in layered cathode materials, leading to serious interfacial reactions and performance degradation. This phenomenon is particularly evident in O3&#8208;NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2 (NCMT). In this study, a strategy is proposed to transform waste into treasure by converting residual alkali into a solid electrolyte. Mg(CH3COO)2 and H3PO4 are reacted with surface residual alkali to generate the solid electrolyte NaMgPO4 on the surface of NCMT, which can be labeled as NaMgPO4@NaNi0.4Cu0.1Mn0.4Ti0.1O2&#8208;X (NMP@NCMT&#8208;X, where X indicates the different amounts of Mg2+ and PO43&#8722;). NaMgPO4 acts as a special ionic conductivity channel on the surface to improve the kinetics of the electrode reactions, remarkably improving the rate capability of the modified cathode at a high current density in the half&#8208;cell. Additionally, NMP@NCMT&#8208;2 enables a reversible phase transition from the P3 to OP2 phase in the charge&#8211;discharge process above 4.2&#160;V and achieves a high specific capacity of 157.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding capacity retention in the full cell. The strategy can effectively and reliably stabilize the interface and improve the performance of layered cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs).

         <title>Rational Design of N&#8208;Doped Carbon&#8208;Coated Cobalt Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient and Durable Photothermal CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles, derived from two&#8208;step pyrolysis of ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, exhibit highly efficient and durable catalytic performance for photothermal hydrogenation of CO2. As verified by experimental observations and theoretical simulations, such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively promote the desorption of CO and activation of CO2 and H2 molecules due to the strong photothermal effect.








Abstract
Photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is an appealing approach to alleviate energy and environmental concerns. However, it still relies on the development of earth&#8208;abundant, efficient, and durable catalysts. Here, the design of N&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;coated Co nanoparticles (NPs), as a photothermal catalyst, synthesized through a two&#8208;step pyrolysis of Co&#8208;based ZIF&#8208;67 precursor, is reported. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits remarkable activity and stability for photothermal CO2 hydrogenation to CO with a 0.75&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 CO production rate under the full spectrum of light illumination. The high activity and durability of these Co NPs are mainly attributed to the synergy of the attuned size of Co NPs, the thickness of carbon layers, and the N doping species. Impressively, the experimental characterizations and theoretical simulations show that such a simple N&#8208;doped carbon coating strategy can effectively facilitate the desorption of generated CO and activation of reactants due to the strong photothermal effect. This work provides a simple and efficient route for the preparation of highly active and durable nonprecious metal catalysts for promising photothermal catalytic reactions.

         <title>In Situ Self&#8208;Elimination of Defects via Controlled Perovskite Crystallization Dynamics for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that a hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive enables the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. The improved perovskite crystallization dynamics finally endow&#160;solar cells with high efficiencies of 25.14% at 300 K and 26.12% at 240 K. 








Abstract
Understanding and controlling crystallization is crucial for high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient solar cells. Herein, the&#160;issue of defects in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) formation is addressed, focusing on the role of intermediates. A comprehensive picture of structural and carrier evolution during crystallization is demonstrated using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Three crystallization stages are identified: precursors to the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 intermediate, then to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, where defects spontaneously emerge. A hydrogen&#8208;sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive is found to enable the phase&#8208;conversion pathway of precursors &#8594; solvated intermediates &#8594; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, during which the spontaneous generation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 can be effectively circumvented. This additive extends the initial growth kinetics and facilitates solvent&#8211;FA+ ion exchange, which results in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. Therefore, the improved crystallization dynamics lead to larger grain sizes and fewer defects within thin films. Ultimately, the improved perovskite crystallization dynamics enable&#160;high&#8208;performance solar cells,&#160;achieving impressive efficiencies of 25.14%&#160;at 300&#160;K and 26.12% at 240&#160;K. This breakthrough might open up a new era of application for the emerging perovskite photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Anions Regulation Engineering Enables a Highly Reversible and Dendrite&#8208;Free Nickel&#8208;Metal Anode with Ultrahigh Capacities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nickel as a transition metal has excellent electrochemical properties, which is expected to be one of the attractive metal anodes in aqueous batteries. In this work, nickel&#8208;metal batteries by the design of an anion&#8208;regulation electrolyte achieve reversible nickel plating/stripping with an ultrahigh capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of 15&#160;000&#160;times.








Abstract
The development of safe and high&#8208;energy metal anodes represents a crucial research direction. Here, the achievement of highly reversible, dendrite&#8208;free transition metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities by regulating aqueous electrolytes is reported. Using nickel (Ni) as a model, theoretical and experimental evidence demonstrating the beneficial role of chloride ions in inhibiting and disrupting the nickel hydroxide passivation layer on the Ni electrode is provided. As a result, Ni anodes with an ultrahigh areal capacity of 1000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 (volumetric capacity of &#8776;6000&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3), and a Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% on a carbon substrate, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal electrodes by approximately two orders of magnitude, are realized. Furthermore, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a series of full cells based on the Ni anode is&#160;developed. The designed Ni&#8211;MnO2 full battery exhibits a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, while the Ni&#8211;PbO2 full battery achieves a high areal capacity of 200&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings of this study are important for enlightening a new arena toward the advancement of dendrite&#8208;free Ni&#8208;metal anodes with ultrahigh capacities and long cycle life for various energy&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Halide Perovskites and their Derivatives for Efficient, High&#8208;Resolution Direct Radiation Detection: Design Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the rapid rise in performance of optoelectronic devices based on lead&#8208;halide perovskites (LHPs). The large mobility&#8208;lifetime products and defect tolerance of these materials, essential for optoelectronics, also make them well&#8208;suited for radiation detectors, especially given the heavy elements present, which is essential for strong X&#8208;ray and &#947;&#8208;ray attenuation. Over the past decade, LHP thick films, wafers and single crystals have given rise to direct radiation detectors that have outperformed incumbent technologies in terms of sensitivity (reported values up to 3.5&#215;106 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2), limit of detection (directly measured values down to 1.5 nGyair s&#8722;1), along with competitive energy and imaging resolution at room temperature. At the same time, lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;inspired materials (e.g., methylammonium bismuth iodide), which have underperformed in solar cells, have recently matched and, in some areas (e.g., in polarization stability), surpassed the performance of LHP detectors. These advances open up opportunities to achieve devices for safer medical imaging, as well as more effective non&#8208;invasive analysis for security, nuclear safety or product inspection. Herein, we discuss the principles behind the rapid rises in performance of LHP and perovskite&#8208;inspired material detectors, and how their properties and performance link with critical applications in non&#8208;invasive diagnostics. We discuss the key strategies to engineer the performance of these materials, and the important challenges to overcome to commercialize these new technologies.

         <title>Covert Scattering Control in Metamaterials with Non&#8208;Locally Encoded Hidden Symmetry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Symmetries and tunability are of fundamental importance in wave scattering control, but symmetries are often obvious upon visual inspection which constitutes a significant vulnerability of metamaterial wave devices to reverse&#8208;engineering risks. Here, it is theoretically and experimentally shown that a symmetry in the reduced basis of the &#8220;primary meta&#8208;atoms&#8221; that are directly connected to the outside world is sufficient; meanwhile, a suitable topology of non&#8208;local interactions between them, mediated by the internal &#8220;secondary&#8221; meta&#8208;atoms, can hide the symmetry from sight in the canonical basis. Covert symmetry&#8208;based scattering control in a cable&#8208;network metamaterial featuring a hidden parity (P$\mathcal {P}$) symmetry in combination with hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;preserving and hidden&#8208;P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking tuning mechanisms is experimentally demonstrated. Physical&#8208;layer security in wired communications is achieved, using the domain&#8208;wise hidden P$\mathcal {P}$&#8208;symmetry as shared secret between the sender and the legitimate receiver. Within the approximation of negligible absorption, the first tuning of a complex scattering metamaterial without mirror symmetry to feature exceptional points (EPs) of PT$\mathcal {PT}$&#8208;symmetric reflectionless states, as well as quasi&#8208;bound states in the continuum, is reported. These results are reproduced in metamaterials involving non&#8208;reciprocal interactions between meta&#8208;atoms, including the first observation of reflectionless EPs in a non&#8208;reciprocal&#160;system.

         <title>Bistable spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles for molecular electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The field of spin&#8208;crossover complexes is rapidly evolving from the study of the spin transition phenomenon to its exploitation in molecular electronics. Such spin transition is gradual in a single&#8208;molecule, while in bulk it can be abrupt, showing sometimes thermal hysteresis and thus a memory effect. A convenient way to keep this bistability while reducing the size of the spin&#8208;crossover material is to process it as nanoparticles. Here, we review the most recent advances in the chemical design of these nanoparticles and their integration into electronic devices, paying particular attention to optimizing the switching ratio. Then, we focus on integrating spin&#8208;crossover nanoparticles over 2D materials to improve the endurance, performance, and detection of the spin state in these hybrid devices.

         <title>Efficient CO2 Electroreduction to Multicarbon Products at Cusio3/Cuo Derived Interfaces In Ordered Pores</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added multicarbon (C2+) chemicals holds promise for reducing CO2 emissions and advancing carbon neutrality. However, achieving both high conversion rate and selectivity remains challenging due to the limited active sites on catalysts for carbon&#8208;carbon (C&#8208;C) coupling. Herein, porous CuO is coated with amorphous CuSiO3 (p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO) to maximize the active interface sites, enabling efficient CO2 reduction to C2+ products. Significantly, the p&#8208;CuSiO3/CuO catalyst exhibits impressive C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 77.8% in an H&#8208;cell at &#8208;1.2&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.1&#160;M KHCO3 and remarkable C2H4 and C2+ FEs of 82.0% and 91.7% in a flow cell at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KOH. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the active interfaces facilitate CO2 activation and lower the formation energy of the key intermediate *OCCOH, thus promoting CO2 conversion to C2+. This work provides a rational design for steering the active sites toward C2+ products.

         <title>Plasticizer&#8208;induced Enhancement of Mesoscale Dissymmetry in Thin Films of Chiral Polymers with Variable Chain Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conjugated polymers with chiral side chains are of interest in areas including chiral photonics, optoelectronics, and chemical and biological sensing. However, the low dissymmetry factors of most neat polymer thin films have limited their practical application. Here, we demonstrate a robust method to increase the absorption dissymmetry factor in a poly&#8208;fluorene&#8208;thiophene (PF8TS series) system by varying molecular weight and introducing an achiral plasticizer, polyethylene monoalcohol (PEM&#8208;OH). Extending chain length within the optimal range and adding this long&#8208;chain alcohol significantly enhanced the chiroptical properties of spin&#8208;coated and annealed thin films. Mueller matrix ellipsometric analysis showed good agreement with the steady&#8208;state transmission measurements confirming a strong chiral response (circular dichroism and circular birefringence), ruling out linear dichroism, birefringence, and specific reflection effects. Solid&#8208;state NMR studies of annealed hybrid chiral polymer systems showed enhancement of signals associated with aromatic &#960;&#8208;stacked backbone and the ordered side&#8208;chain conformations. Further studies using Raman spectrometry, X&#8208;ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force microscopy, and polarized optical microscopy indicate that PEM&#8208;OH facilitates mesoscopic crystal domain ordering upon annealing. This provides new insights into routes for tuning optical activity in conjugated polymers.

Abstract
Nanozymes, next&#8208;generation enzyme&#8208;mimicking nanomaterials, have entered an era of rational design; among them, Co&#8208;based nanozymes have emerged as captivating players over times. Co&#8208;based nanozymes were developed and have garnered significant attention over the past five years. Their extraordinary properties, including regulatable enzymatic activity, stability, and multifunctionality stemming from magnetic properties, photothermal conversion effects, cavitation effects, and relaxation efficiency, have made Co&#8208;based nanozymes a rising star. This review presents the first comprehensive profiling of the Co&#8208;based nanozymes in the chemistry, biology, and environmental sciences. The review begins by scrutinizing the various synthetic methods employed for Co&#8208;based nanozyme fabrication, such as template and sol&#8208;gel methods, highlighting their distinctive merits from a chemical standpoint. Furthermore, we provide a detailed exploration of their wide&#8208;ranging applications in biosensing and biomedical therapeutics, as well as their contributions to environmental monitoring and remediation. Notably, drawing inspiration from state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques such as omics, a comprehensive analysis of Co&#8208;based nanozymes is undertaken, employing analogous statistical methodologies to provide valuable guidance. To conclude, we present a comprehensive outlook on the challenges and prospects for Co&#8208;based nanozymes, spanning from microscopic physicochemical mechanisms to macroscopic clinical translational applications.

         <title>Easy&#8208;To&#8208;Wear Auxetic SMA Knot&#8208;Architecture for Spatiotemporal and Multimodal Haptic Feedbacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Wearable haptic interfaces prioritize user comfort, but also value the ability to provide diverse feedback patterns for immersive interactions with the virtual or augmented reality. Here, to provide both comfort and diverse tactile feedback, the easy&#8208;to&#8208;wear and multimodal wearable haptic auxetic fabric (WHAF) is prepared by knotting shape memory alloy (SMA) wires into an auxetic&#8208;structured fabric. This unique meta&#8208;design allows the WHAF to completely expand and contract in 3D, providing superior size&#8208;fitting and shape&#8208;fitting capabilities. Additionally, a micro&#8208;scale thin layer of Parylene is coated on the surface to create electrically separated zones within the WHAF, featuring zone&#8208;specified actuation for conveying diverse spatiotemporal information to users with using the WHAF alone. Depending on the body part it is worn on, the WHAF conveys either cutaneous or kinesthetic feedback, thus, working as a multimodal wearable haptic interface. As a result, when worn on the forearm, the WHAF intuitively provided spatiotemporal information to users during hands&#8208;free navigation and teleoperation in virtual reality, and when worn on the elbow, the WHAF guided users to reach the desired elbow flexion, like a personal exercise advisor.

         <title>Oral Nanomedicine: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Compared to injection administration, oral administration is free of discomfort, wound infection and complications and has a higher compliance rate for patients with diverse diseases. However, oral administration reduces the bioavailability of medicines, especially biologics (e.g., peptides, proteins, and antibodies), due to harsh gastrointestinal biological barriers. In this context, the development and prosperity of nanotechnology have helped improve the bioactivity and oral availability of oral medicine. On this basis, we first discussed the biological barriers to oral administration, and then reviewed oral nanomedicine based on organic and inorganic nanomaterials and their biomedical applications in diverse diseases. Finally, we put forward the challenges and potential opportunities in the future development of oral nanomedicine, which may provide a vital reference for the eventual clinical transformation and standardized production of oral nanomedicine.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Perception of Object's Deformability with Multiple Deformation Attributes Utilizing Biomimetic Mechanoreceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The perception of object's deformability in unstructured interactions relies on both kinesthetic and cutaneous cues to adapt the uncertainties of an object. However, the existing tactile sensors cannot provide adequate cutaneous cues to self&#8208;adaptively estimate the material softness, especially in non&#8208;standard contact scenarios where the interacting object deviates from the assumption of an elastic half&#8208;infinite body. This paper proposes an innovative design of a tactile sensor that integrates the capabilities of two slow&#8208;adapting mechanoreceptors within a soft medium, allowing self&#8208;decoupled sensing of local pressure and strain at specific locations within the contact interface. By leveraging these localized cutaneous cues, the sensor can accurately and self&#8208;adaptively measure the material softness of an object, accommodating variations in thicknesses and applied forces. Furthermore, when combined with a kinesthetic cue from the robot, the sensor can enhance tactile expression by the synergy of two relevant deformation attributes, including material softness and compliance. We demonstrate that the biomimetic fusion of tactile information can fully comprehend the deformability of an object, hence facilitating robotic decision&#8208;making and dexterous manipulation.

         <title>Force Trigged Self&#8208;destructive Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;Destructive Polymers (SDPs) are defined as a class of smart polymers that autonomously degrade upon experiencing an external trigger, such as a chemical cue or optical excitation. Because SDPs release the materials trapped inside the network upon degradation, they have potential applications in drug delivery and analytical sensing. However, to the best of our knowledge, SDPs that respond to external mechanical forces have not been reported, as it is fundamentally challenging to create mechano&#8208;sensitivity in general and especially so for force levels below those required for classical force&#8208;induced bond scission. To address this challenge, we describe the development of force&#8208;triggered SDPs comprised of DNA crosslinked hydrogels doped with nucleases. Externally&#8208;applied piconewton forces selectively expose enzymatic cleavage sites within the DNA crosslinks, resulting in rapid polymer self&#8208;degradation. We describe the synthesis, chemical and mechanical characterization of DNA crosslinked hydrogels, as well as the kinetics of force&#8208;triggered hydrolysis. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we also demonstrate force&#8208;triggered and time&#8208;dependent rheological changes in the polymer as well as encapsulated nanoparticle release. Finally, we show that the kinetics of self&#8208;destruction can be tuned as a function of nuclease concentration, incubation time, and the thermodynamic stability of DNA crosslinkers.

         <title>Partial Chemicalization of Nanoscale Metals: An Intra&#8208;Material Transformative Approach for the Synthesis of Functional Colloidal Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Nanoheterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Heterostructuring colloidal nanocrystals into multicomponent modular constructs, where domains of distinct metal and semiconductor phases are interconnected through bonding interfaces, is a consolidated approach to advanced breeds of solution&#8208;processable hybrid nanomaterials capable to express richly tunable and even entirely novel physical&#8208;chemical properties and functionalities. To meet the challenges posed by the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures, and to overcome some intrinsic limitations of available protocols, innovative transformative routes, based on the paradigm of partial chemicalization, have recently been devised within the framework of the standard seeded&#8208;growth scheme. These techniques involve regiospecific replacement reactions on preformed nanocrystal substrates, thus holding great synthetic potential for programmable configurational diversification. This Review article illustrates achievements so far made in the elaboration of metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures with tailored arrangements of their component modules by means of conversion pathways that leverage on spatially controlled partial chemicalization of mono&#8208; and bi&#8208;metallic seeds. Advantages and limitations of these approaches are discussed within the context of the most plausible mechanisms underlying the evolution of the nanoheterostructures in liquid media. Representative physical&#8208;chemical properties and applications of chemicalization&#8208;derived metal&#8208;semiconductor nanoheterostructures are emphasized. Finally, prospects for developments in the field are outlined.

         <title>Multifunctional PtCuTe Nanosheets with Strong Ros Scavenging And ROS&#8208;independent Antibacterial Properties Promote Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanozymes, as one of the most efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging biomaterials, are receiving wide attention in promoting diabetic wound healing. Despite recent attempts at improving the catalytic efficiency of Pt&#8208;based nanozymes, (e.g., PtCu, one of the best systems), they still display quite limited ROS scavenging capacity and ROS&#8208;dependent antibacterial effects on bacteria or immunocytes, which leads to uncontrolled and poor diabetic wound healing. Hence, we report a new class of multifunctional PtCuTe nanosheets with excellent catalytic, ROS&#8208;independent antibacterial, pro&#8208;angiogenic, anti&#8208;inflammatory and immuno&#8208;modulatory properties for boosting the diabetic wound healing. We demonstrate that the PtCuTe nanosheets show stronger ROS scavenging capacity and better antibacterial effects than PtCu. We also revealed that the PtCuTe can enhance vascular tube formation, stimulate macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and improve fibroblast mobility, outperforming conventional PtCu. Moreover, PtCuTe promotes crosstalk between different cell types to form a positive feedback loop. Consequently, PtCuTe stimulated a pro&#8208;regenerative environment with relevant cell populations to ensure normal tissue repair. Utilizing a diabetic mouse model, we demonstrated that PtCuTe significantly facilitated the regeneration of highly vascularized skin, with the percentage of wound closure being over 90% on the 8th day, which is the best among the reported comparable multifunctional biomaterials.

         <title>Tumor Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticles Amplifying STING Signaling Pathway for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Insufficient activation of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway and profoundly immunosuppressive microenvironment largely limits the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we exploited tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive nanoparticles (PMM NPs) that simultaneously harness STING and Toll&#8208;like receptor 4 (TLR4) to augment STING activation via TLR4&#8208;mediated nuclear factor&#8208;kappa B signaling pathway stimulation, leading to the increased secretion of type I interferons (i.e., 4.0&#8208;fold enhancement of IFN&#8208;&#946;) and pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines to promote a specific T cell immune response. Moreover, PMM NPs relieved the immunosuppression of the TME by decreasing the percentage of Tregs, and polarizing M2 macrophages to the M1 type, thus creating an immune&#8208;supportive TME to unleash a cascade adaptive immune response. Combined with an anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody, synergistic efficacy was achieved in both inflamed colorectal cancer and non&#8208;inflamed metastatic breast tumor models. Moreover, rechallenging tumor&#8208;free animals with hypotonic cells induced complete tumor rejection, indicating the generation of systemic antitumor memory. These TME&#8208;responsive nanoparticles may open a new avenue to achieve the spatiotemporal orchestration of STING activation, providing a promising clinical candidate for next&#8208;generation cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>How Photogenerated I2 Induces I&#8208;rich Phase Formation in Lead Mixed Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bandgap tunability of lead mixed halide perovskites (LMHPs) is a crucial characteristic for versatile optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, LMHPs show the formation of iodide&#8208;rich (I&#8208;rich) phase under illumination, which destabilizes the semiconductor bandgap and impedes their exploitation. Here, we show how I2, photogenerated upon charge carrier trapping at iodine interstitials in LMHPs, can promote the formation of I&#8208;rich phase. I2 can react with bromide (Br&#8722;) in the perovskite to form a trihalide ion I2Br&#8722; (I&#948;&#8722;&#8208;I&#948;+&#8208;Br&#948;&#8722;), whose negatively charged iodide (I&#948;&#8722;) can further exchange with another lattice Br&#8722; to form the I&#8208;rich phase. Importantly, we observe that the effectiveness of the process is dependent on the overall stability of the crystalline perovskite structure. Therefore, the bandgap instability in LMHPs is governed by two factors, i.e., the density of native defects leading to I2 production and the Br&#8722; binding strength within the crystalline unit. Eventually, our study provides rules for the design of chemical composition in LMHPs to reach their full potential for optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Phosphorescent Dye Sensitized Quantum&#8208;Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with 37% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Exciton harvesting is of paramount importance for quantum&#8208;dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs). Direct exciton harvesting by quantum dots (QDs) emitting layer suffers from poor hole injection due to the low conduction bands and valence bands of QDs, leading to unbalanced electron&#8208;hole injection and recombination. To address this issue, here we report an exciton sensitizing approach, where excitons form on a phosphorescent dye doped layer which then transfer their energies to adjacent QDs layer for photon emission. Due to the very efficient exciton formation and energy transfer processes, higher device performance could be achieved. To demonstrate the above strategy, red QLEDs with a phosphorescent dye Iridium (III) bis (2 &#8211; methyldibenzo &#8211; [f, h] quinoxaline) (acetylacetonate), Ir(MDQ)2(acac) doped hole transporting layer were fabricated and studied. At a doping concentration of 10&#160;wt.%, the best device achieves record high current efficiency, power efficiency and external quantum efficiency of 37.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, 41.0&#160;lm W&#8722;1 and 37.0%, respectively. Simultaneously, the efficiency roll&#8208;off characteristic was greatly improved that 35.0% EQE can be well remained at high luminance level of 450 000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Moreover, the devices also exhibit good stability and reproducibility.

         <title>Crystal Engineering of Silica Anode Achieving Intrinsic Zero&#8208;Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Si&#8208;based anodes have large intrinsic volume expansion, which hinders their practicality and commercialisation. To address this challenge, the design principle of intrinsic zero&#8208;strain anodes (&#9312; large intracrystalline cavities and &#9313; strong bonds) is proposed, and silica with large intracrystalline cavities (SLIC) established by strong Si&#8211;O bonds ([SiO4] coordinate structures) is obtained and acts as an anode, achieving the intrinsic zero&#8208;strain feature first in silicon&#8208;based anodes. The phase structure of SLIC is maintained and the [SiO4] coordinate structure merely shows slight disorder during cycling. The feature stems from lithiation taking place by the solid&#8208;solution insertion reaction rather than the conventional conversion/alloying addition reactions, because the solid&#8208;solution insertion reaction for the SLIC has the lowest change in the Gibbs free energy. The SLIC anode demonstrates excellent cycling stability and high initial Coulombic efficiency (&#8764;85%). Moreover, owing to the low working voltage (&#8764;0.28&#160;V) and relatively high specific capacity, the SLIC anode presents the highest gravimetric energy density among reported zero&#8208;/quasi&#8208;zero&#8208;strain anodes and high volumetric energy density (around twice as much as graphite). The universality of the designing principle is also validated. Our work provides design guidelines for zero&#8208;strain anodes in next&#8208;generation batteries.

         <title>Tailoring Enantiomeric Chiral Channels in Metal&#8208;Peptide Networks: A Novel Foldamer&#8208;Based Approach for Host&#8208;Guest Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Designing chiral channels in organic frameworks presents an ongoing challenge due to the intricate control of size, shape, and functionality required. A novel approach is presented, which crafts enantiomeric chiral channels in metal&#8208;peptide networks (MPNs) by integrating short foldamer ligands with CuI clusters. The MPN structure serves as a 3D blueprint for host&#8208;guest chemistry, fostering modular substitution to refine chiral channel properties at the atomic scale. Incorporating hydrogen bond networks augments guest molecule interactions with the channel surface. This approach expedites enantiomer discrimination in racemic mixtures and incites adaptable guest molecules to take on specific axially chiral conformations. Distinct from traditional metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and conventional reticular architectures, this foldamer&#8208;based methodology provides a predictable and customizable host&#8208;guest interaction system within a 3D topology. This innovation sets the stage for multifunctional materials that merge host&#8208;guest interaction systems with metal&#8208;complex properties, opening up potential applications in catalysis, sensing, and drug delivery.

         <title>Antibacterial Fusobacterium Nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking Nanomedicine to Selectively Eliminate Tumor&#8208;colonized Bacteria And Enhance Immunotherapy Against Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Clinical evidence has indicated that tumor&#8208;colonizing bacteria would be closely related to the tumor development and therapeutic responses. Selectively eliminating bacteria within tumors may be an attractive approach to enhance cancer treatment without additional side effects. Herein, we found that owing to the high affinity between the membrane protein Fap&#8208;2 on Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and D&#8208;galactose&#8208;&#946; (1&#8208;3)&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;D&#8208;galactosamine (Gal&#8208;GalNAc) overexpressed on colorectal tumor cells, F. nucleatum would colonize in colorectal tumors, as evidenced by both clinical samples and animal tumor models. Notably, F. nucleatum colonized in colorectal tumors would lead to immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, greatly reducing their responses to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Inspired by this finding, we designed a F. nucleatum&#8208;mimetic nanomedicine by fusing F. nucleatum cytoplasmic membrane (FM) with Colistin loaded liposomes to achieve selectively killing tumor&#8208;colonizing F. nucleatum without affecting gut microbes. As the results, the therapeutic responses of F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized tumors to ICB therapies could be successfully restored, as demonstrated in F. nucleatum&#8208;infected subcutaneous CT&#8208;26 tumor model, chemical&#8208;induced spontaneous colorectal cancer models and MC&#8208;38 tumor model. In summary, our work presented a F. nucleatum&#8208;Mimicking nanomedicine which could selectively eliminate tumor&#8208;colonized bacteria, promising for enhancing the responses of cancer immunotherapy against F. nucleatum&#8208;colonized colorectal cancer.

Abstract
Compared to solid scintillators and organic liquid scintillators, aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillators (AbLS) have more superiority in highly flexible scalability, yet are now limited by their low light yield (&#8764;100 photons/MeV). Here, we synthesize aqueous&#8208;based inorganic colloidal halide perovskites with high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of three primary color luminescence up to 88.1% (red), 96% (green), 81.8% (blue), respectively, and fabricate a new generation of colloidal perovskite&#8208;mediated aqueous&#8208;based liquid scintillator (PAbLS) with light yield increased in comparison with commercial scintillator AbLS. We expound on the excellent PLQY and colloidal dispersion of halide perovskites benefits from PEG modification, which ensures the vacancy inhibition and formation of defect&#8208;free surfaces in an aqueous solution. Moreover, their high luminescent emission can be maintained for 100 days at low temperatures, and such modification also promises the heat&#8208;to&#8208;cold customization of operating temperature even in ice below 0&#176;C. Finally, depending on the light yield of around 3058 and 8037 photons/MeV at room temperature and low temperature, PAbLS with shape/size scalability exhibit their robust radiation hardness (dose rate as high as 23 mGy/s) and conceptual application potential in high&#8208;energy ray radiation detection from every angle of 360 degrees.

Abstract
Microfluidics, with its remarkable capacity to manipulate fluids and droplets at the microscale, has emerged as a powerful platform in numerous fields. In contrast to conventional closed microchannel microfluidic systems, free&#8208;boundary microfluidic manufacturing (FBMM) processes continuous precursor fluids into jets or droplets in a relatively spacious environment. FBMM is highly regarded for its superior flexibility, stability, economy, usability, and versatility in the manufacturing of advanced materials and architectures. In this review, a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in FBMM is provided, encompassing technical principles, advanced material manufacturing, and their applications. FBMM is categorized based on the foundational mechanisms, primarily comprising hydrodynamics, interface effects, acoustics, and electrohydrodynamic. The processes and mechanisms of fluid manipulation are thoroughly discussed. Additionally, the manufacturing of advanced materials in various dimensions ranging from zero&#8208;dimensional to three&#8208;dimensional, as well as their diverse applications in material science, biomedical engineering, and engineering are presented. Finally, current progress is summarized and future challenges are prospected. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of FBMM as a powerful tool for advanced materials manufacturing and its wide&#8208;ranging applications.

         <title>Unravelling Twin Topotactic/Nontopotactic Reactive TiSe2 Cathodes for Aqueous Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Titanium selenide (TiSe2), a model transition metal chalcogenide material, typically relies on topotactic ion intercalation/deintercalation to achieve stable ion storage with minimal disruption of the transport pathways but has restricted capacity (&lt;130 mAh g&#8722;1). Developing novel energy storage mechanisms beyond conventional intercalation to break capacity limits in TiSe2 cathodes is essential yet challenging. Herein, we revisited the ion storage properties of TiSe2 and unraveled an unusual thermodynamically stable twin topotactic/nontopotactic Cu2+ accommodation mechanism for aqueous batteries. In&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex&#8208;situ microscopy jointly demonstrated that topotactic intercalation sustained the ion transport framework, nontopotactic conversion involved localized multielectron reactions, and these two parallel reactions were miraculously intertwined in nanoscale space. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical results suggested that the twin&#8208;reaction mechanism significantly improved the electron transfer ability, and the reserved intercalated TiSe2 structure anchored the reduced titanium monomers with high&#8208;affinity and promoted efficient charge transfer to synergistically enhance the capacity and reversibility. Consequently, TiSe2 nanoflake cathodes delivered a never&#8208;before&#8208;achieved capacity of 275.9 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1, 93.5% capacity retention over 1000 cycles, and endow hybrid batteries (TiSe2&#8208;Cu||Zn) with a stable energy supply of 181.34&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2339.81&#160;W kg&#8722;1, offering a promising model for aqueous ion storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;rolled&#8208;up Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline Silicon Nanomembranes for On&#8208;Chip Tubular Polarization Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Freestanding single&#8208;crystalline nanomembranes and their assembly have broad application potential in photodetectors for integrated chips. However, the release and self&#8208;assembly process of single&#8208;crystalline semiconductor nanomembranes still remains great challenges in on&#8208;chip processing and functional integration, and photodetectors based on nanomembrane always suffer from limited absorption of nanoscale thickness. Here, we employ a non&#8208;destructive releasing and rolling process to prepare tubular photodetectors based on freestanding single&#8208;crystalline Si nanomembranes. Spontaneous release and self&#8208;assembly are achieved by residual strain introduced by lattice mismatch at the epitaxial interface of Si and Ge, and the intrinsic stress and strain distributions in self&#8208;rolled&#8208;up Si nanomembranes are analyzed experimentally and computationally. The advantages of light trapping and wide&#8208;angle optical coupling are realized by tubular geometry. Our Si microtube device achieves reliable Ohmic contact and exhibits a photoresponsivity of over 330&#160;mA/W, a response time of 370 &#956;s, and a light incident detection angle range of over 120&#176;. Furthermore, the microtubular structure shows a distinct polarization angle&#8208;dependent light absorption, with a dichroic ratio of 1.24 achieved at 940&#160;nm. The proposed Si&#8208;based microtubes provide new possibilities for the construction of multifunctional chips for integrated circuit ecosystems in More than Moore era.

         <title>Exploring the Role of Spatial Confinement in Immune Cell Recruitment and Regeneration of Skin Wounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microporous annealed particle (MAP) scaffolds are injectable granular materials comprised of micron sized hydrogel particles (microgels). The diameter of these microgels directly determines the size of the interconnected void space between particles where infiltrating or encapsulated cells reside. This tunable porosity allows us to use MAP scaffolds to study the impact of spatial confinement (SC) on both cellular behaviors and the host response to biomaterials. Despite previous studies showing that pore size and SC influence cellular phenotypes, including mitigating the macrophage inflammatory response, there is still a gap in knowledge regarding how SC within a biomaterial modulates immune cell recruitment in vivo in wounds and implants. Thus, we studied the immune cell profile within confined and unconfined biomaterials using small (40&#160;&#956;m), medium (70&#160;&#956;m), and large (130&#160;&#956;m) diameter spherical microgels, respectively. We discovered that MAP scaffolds impart regenerative wound healing with an IgG1&#8208;biased Th2 response. MAP scaffolds made with large microgels promoted a balanced pro&#8208;regenerative macrophage response, resulting in enhanced wound healing with mature collagen regeneration and reduced inflammation levels.

         <title>Reversible Multi&#8208;Electron Redox Chemistry in NASICON&#8208;Type Cathode Toward High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density And Long&#8208;Life Sodium&#8208;Ion Full Batteries</title>

Abstract
Na&#8208;superionic&#8208;conductor (NASICON)&#8208;type cathodes (e.g., Na3V2(PO4)3) have attracted extensive attention due to their open and robust framework, fast Na+ mobility and superior thermal stability. To commercialize sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), higher energy density and lower cost requirements are urgently needed for NASICON&#8208;type cathodes. Herein, Na3.5V1.5Fe0.5(PO4)3 (NVFP) is designed by Fe substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realize the high&#8208;voltage multi&#8208;electron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g&#8722;1), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10,000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X&#8208;ray diffraction and ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe2+/Fe3+, V3+/V4+ and V4+/V5+) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic&#8208;migration energy barrier and ideal Na+ diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher&#8208;valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50C), along with material&#8208;level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.

Herein, Na&lt;sub&gt;3.5&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;1.5&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (NVFP) is designed by Fe substitution strategy, which not only reduces the exorbitant cost of vanadium, but also realize the high-voltage multi-electron reactions. The NVFP cathode can deliver extraordinary capacity (148.2 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and decent cycling durability up to 84% after 10,000 cycles at 100 C. In situ X-ray diffraction and ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations reveal reversible structural evolution and redox processes (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt;) during electrochemical reactions. The low ionic-migration energy barrier and ideal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics are elucidated by density functional theory calculations. Combined with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fe with unpaired electrons in the 3d orbital is inseparable from the higher-valence redox activation. More competitively, coupling with a hard carbon (HC) anode, HC//NVFP full cells demonstrate high-rate capability and long-duration cycling lifespan (3000 stable cycles at 50C), along with material-level energy density up to 304&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. The present work can provide new perspectives to accelerate the commercialization of SIBs.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The chemical, physical and biological effects of chiral nanomaterials have inspired general interest and demonstrated the important advantages in fundamental science. Here, we fabricated chiral iron oxide supraparticles (Fe3O4 SPs) modified by chiral penicillamine (Pen) molecules with a g&#8208;factor of approximately 2 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 415&#160;nm, these SPs acted as a high&#8208;quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent. Therein, the transverse relaxation efficiency and T2&#8208;MRI results demonstrated the chiral Fe3O4 SPs had a r2 relaxivity of 157.39 &#177; 2.34 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs and 136.21 &#177; 1.26 mM&#8722;1&#183;S&#8722;1 for L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs due to the enhanced electronic transition dipole moment for D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs compared with L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. The in vivo MRI results showed that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs exhibited a two&#8208;fold lower contrast ratio than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs, which enhanced targeted enrichment in tumor tissue, such as prostate cancer, melanoma, and brain glioma tumor. Notably, it w as found that D&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs had a 7.7&#8208;fold higher affinity for the tumor cell surface receptor cluster&#8208;of&#8208;differentiation 47 (CD47) than L&#8208;Fe3O4 SPs. These findings uncovered that chiral Fe3O4 SPs act as a highly effective MRI contrast agent for targeting and imaging broad tumors, thus accelerating the practical application of chiral nanomaterials and deepening the understanding of chirality in the biological and non&#8208;biological environments.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Interface Engineering of Conformal 2D/3D Perovskite Heterojunction for Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method, prepared robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath 3D perovskite enable the formation of a conformal 2D/3D heterostructure at the buried interface. Owing to the influence of the heterojunction on crystallization and interfacial modulation, perovskite&#8211;silicon tandem solar cells based on industrially fully textured silicon achieve an efficiency of 29.8% (certified 28.4%).








Abstract
Exploring strategies to control the crystallization and modulate interfacial properties for high&#8208;quality perovskite film on industry&#8208;relevant textured crystalline silicon solar cells is highly valued in the perovskite/silicon tandem photovoltaics community. The formation of a 2D/3D perovskite heterojunction is widely employed to passivate defects and suppress ion migration in the film surface of perovskite solar cells. However, realizing solution&#8208;processed heterostructures at the buried interface faces solvent incompatibilities with the challenge of underlying&#8208;layer disruption, and texture incompatibilities with the challenge of uneven coverage. Here, a hybrid two&#8208;step deposition method is used to prepare robust 2D perovskites with cross&#8208;linkable ligands underneath the 3D perovskite. This structurally coherent interlayer benefits by way of preferred crystal growth of strain&#8208;free and uniform upper perovskite, inhibits interfacial defect&#8208;induced instability and recombination, and promotes charge&#8208;carrier extraction with ideal energy&#8208;level alignment. The broad applicability of the bottom&#8208;contact heterostructure for different textured substrates with conformal coverage and various precursor solutions with intact properties free of erosion are&#160;demonstrated. With this buried interface engineering strategy, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem cells, based on industrially textured Czochralski (CZ) silicon, achieve a certified efficiency of 28.4% (1.0 cm2), while retaining 89% of the initial PCE after over 1000 h operation.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency Ternary Organic Solar Cells with 300&#160;nm Thick Active Layer Enabled by An Oligomeric Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of high&#8208;efficiency thickness&#8208;insensitive organic solar cells (OSCs) is crucially important for the mass production of solar panels. However, increasing the active layer thickness usually induces a substantial loss in effcicency. We herein adopt a ternary strategy to break this dilemma, in which an oligomer DY&#8208;TF was incorporated into PM6:L8&#8208;BO system as a guest component. The S&#183;&#183;&#183;F intramolecular noncovalent interactions in the backbone endows DY&#8208;TF with a high planarity. Upon the addition of DY&#8208;TF, the crystallinity of the blend is effectively improved, leading to increased charge carrier mobility, which is highly desirable in the fabrication of thick&#8208;film devices. As a result, a thin&#8208;film PM6:L8&#8208;BO:DY&#8208;TF based device (110&#160;nm) shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.13%. Impressively, when the active layer thickness increases to 300&#160;nm, an efficiency of 18.23% (certified as 17.8%) is achieved, representing the highest efficiency reported for 300&#8208;nm&#8208;thick OSCs thus far. Additionally, a blade&#8208;coated thick device (300&#160;nm) delivers a promising PCE of 17.38%. This work brings new insights into the construction of efficient OSCs with high thickness tolerance, showing great potential for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of large&#8208;area solar cells.

         <title>Conducting Polymer Coatings Prepared by Mixed Emulsions are Highly Conductive and Stable in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
An aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer is commonly applied on a substrate to form a coating after drying. The coating, however, disintegrates in water. This paper reports a coating prepared using a mixture of two emulsions: an aqueous emulsion of conducting polymer, and an aqueous emulsion of hydrophobic and rubbery chains copolymerized with silane coupling agents. When applied on a substrate and dried, particles of the mixed emulsion merge into a continuous film. While the conducting polymer forms percolated nanocrystals, the silane groups crosslink the rubbery chains and interlink the rubbery chains to the substrate. The percolated nanocrystals make the coating highly conductive. The covalent network of hydrophobic polymer chains stabilizes the coating in water. The high conductivity and stability in water may enable broad applications.

         <title>Reinforcing Hydrogel by Nonsolvent&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Facilitated In&#160;Situ Nanofibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative nanofibrous hydrogel (nf&#8208;gel) constructed with constituent polymer nanofibers is proposed and fabricated using a two&#8208;step solvent&#8208;exchange method including an essential nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step. These nf&#8208;gels show remarkably enhanced mechanical properties and swelling resistance compared to their molecular counterparts. Particularly, they are isotropic, distinctly different from conventional fiber reinforced hydrogels.. .








Abstract
Nanofibrous hydrogels are pervasive in load&#8208;bearing soft tissues, which are believed to be key to their extraordinary mechanical properties. Enlighted by this phenomenon, a novel reinforcing strategy for polymeric hydrogels is proposed, where polymer segments in the hydrogels are induced to form nanofibers in&#160;situ by bolstering their controllable aggregation at the nanoscale level. Poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogels are chosen to demonstrate the virtue of this strategy. A nonsolvent&#8208;quenching step is introduced into the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogel preparation approach, which readily promotes the formation of nanofibrous hydrogels in the following solvent&#8208;tempering process. The resultant nanofibrous hydrogels demonstrate significantly improved mechanical properties and swelling resistance, compared to the conventional solvent&#8208;exchange hydrogels with identical compositions. This work validates the hypothesis that bundling polymer chains to form nanofibers can lead to nanofibrous hydrogels with remarkably enhanced mechanical performances, which may open a new horizon for single&#8208;component hydrogel reinforcement.

         <title>In Situ Li&#8208;Plating Diagnosis for Fast&#8208;Charging Li&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by Relaxation&#8208;Time Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective indicator of Li&#8208;plating onset is urgently needed to investigate the safety window of Li&#8208;ion batteries. This work demonstrates that the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process is promising for determining Li&#8208;plating onset. A relaxation&#8208;time detection method is proposed, allowing in situ diagnosis of the Li&#8208;plating behavior in fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The Li&#8208;plating behavior of Li&#8208;ion batteries under fast&#8208;charging conditions is elusive due to a lack of reliable indicators of the Li&#8208;plating onset. In this work, the relaxation time constant of the charge&#8208;transfer process (&#964;CT) is proposed to be promising for the determination of Li&#8208;plating onset. A novel pulse/relaxation test method enables rapid access to the &#964;CT of the graphite anode during battery operation, applicable to both half and full batteries. The diagnosis of Li plating at varying temperatures and charging rates enriches the cognition of Li&#8208;plating behaviors. Li plating at low temperatures and high charging rates can be avoided because of the battery voltage limitations. Nevertheless, after the onset, severe Li plating evolves rapidly under harsh charging conditions, while the Li&#8208;plating process under benign charging conditions is accompanied by a simultaneous Li&#8208;intercalation process. The quantitative estimates indicate that Li plating at high temperatures/high charging rates leads to more irreversible capacity losses. This facile method with rational scientific principles can provide inspiration for exploring the safe boundaries of Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Understanding Effects of Alkyl Side&#8208;Chain Density on Polaron Formation Via Electrochemical Doping in Thiophene Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping. In situ monitoring of polaron formation allows identification of its dependence on molecular structures. Understanding of the polaron formation mechanism is important for molecular design rules and its impact on electrical properties.








Abstract
Polarons exist when charges are injected into organic semiconductors due to their strong coupling with the lattice phonons, significantly affecting electronic charge&#8208;transport properties. Understanding the formation and (de)localization of polarons is therefore critical for further developing organic semiconductors as a future electronics platform. However, there are very few studies reported in this area. In particular, there is no direct in situ monitoring of polaron formation and identification of its dependence on molecular structure and impact on electrical properties, limiting further advancement in organic electronics. Herein, how a minor modification of side&#8208;chain density in thiophene&#8208;based conjugated polymers affects the polaron formation via electrochemical doping, changing the polymers&#8217; electrical response to the surrounding dielectric environment for gas sensing, is demonstrated. It is found that the reduction in side&#8208;chain density results in a multistep polaron formation, leading to an initial formation of localized polarons in thiophene units without side chains. Reduced side&#8208;chain density also allows the formation of a high density of polarons with fewer polymer structural changes. More numerous but more localized polarons generate a stronger analyte response but without the selectivity between polar and non&#8208;polar solvents, which is different from the more delocalized polarons that show clear selectivity. The results provide important molecular understanding and design rules for the polaron formation and its impact on electrical properties.

         <title>Protonated Organic Semiconductors: Origin of Water&#8208;Induced Charge&#8208;Trap Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanism of bias&#8208;stress&#8208;induced trap generation in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) is unveiled. The combined spectroscopic method proposes the trap generation from the protonation of low&#8208;bandgap polymers. This concept can be applied to promote the development of highly stable OFETs under bias stress and related application devices.








Abstract
Despite dramatic improvements in the electronic characteristics of organic semiconductors, the low operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) hinders their direct use in practical applications. Although the literature contains numerous reports on the effects of water on the operational stability of OFETs, the underlying mechanisms of trap generation induced by water remain unclear. Here, a protonation&#8208;induced trap generation of organic semiconductors is proposed as a possible origin of the operational instability in organic field&#8208;effect transistors. Spectroscopic and electronic investigation techniques combined with simulations reveal that the direct protonation of organic semiconductors by water during operation may be responsible for the trap generation induced by bias stress; this phenomenon is independent of the trap generation at an insulator surface. In addition, the same feature occurred in small&#8208;bandgap polymers with fused thiophene rings irrespective of their crystalline ordering, implying the generality of protonation induced trap generation in various polymer semiconductors with a small bandgap. The finding of the trap&#8208;generation process provides new perspectives for achieving greater operational stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Data Processing with Photon&#8208;Avalanching Nanocrystalline Photonic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly nonlinear, photoexcitation intensity&#8208;dependent luminescence and residual energy storage in photon&#8208;avalanching inorganic Tm3+&#8208;doped fluoride nanoparticles mimic the behavior of biological synapses. These properties enable all&#8208;optical information processing such as multiple inputs and weighted all&#8208;or&#8208;none response, short memory storage, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, coincidence detection from multiple inputs, and complex 2D image data feature extraction.








Abstract
Data processing and storage in electronic devices are typically performed as a sequence of elementary binary operations. Alternative approaches, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing, are rapidly gaining interest where data processing is relatively slow, but can be performed in a more comprehensive way or massively in parallel, like in neuronal circuits. Here, time&#8208;domain all&#8208;optical information processing capabilities of photon&#8208;avalanching (PA) nanoparticles at room temperature are discovered. Demonstrated functionality resembles properties found in neuronal synapses, such as: paired&#8208;pulse facilitation and short&#8208;term internal memory, in situ plasticity, multiple inputs processing, and all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing threshold response. The PA&#8208;memory&#8208;like behavior shows capability of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;algorithm&#8208;free feature extraction and further recognition of 2D patterns with simple 2 input artificial neural network. Additionally, high nonlinearity of luminescence intensity in response to photoexcitation mimics and enhances spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity that is coherent in nature with the way a sound source is localized in animal neuronal circuits. Not only are yet unexplored fundamental properties of photon&#8208;avalanche luminescence kinetics studied, but this approach, combined with recent achievements in photonics, light confinement and guiding, promises all&#8208;optical data processing, control, adaptive responsivity, and storage on photonic chips.

&lt;p&gt;Data processing and storage in electronic devices are typically performed as a sequence of elementary binary operations. Alternative approaches, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing, are rapidly gaining interest where data processing is relatively slow, but can be performed in a more comprehensive way or massively in parallel, like in neuronal circuits. Here, time-domain all-optical information processing capabilities of photon-avalanching (PA) nanoparticles at room temperature are discovered. Demonstrated functionality resembles properties found in neuronal synapses, such as: paired-pulse facilitation and short-term internal memory, in situ plasticity, multiple inputs processing, and all-or-nothing threshold response. The PA-memory-like behavior shows capability of machine-learning-algorithm-free feature extraction and further recognition of 2D patterns with simple 2 input artificial neural network. Additionally, high nonlinearity of luminescence intensity in response to photoexcitation mimics and enhances spike-timing-dependent plasticity that is coherent in nature with the way a sound source is localized in animal neuronal circuits. Not only are yet unexplored fundamental properties of photon-avalanche luminescence kinetics studied, but this approach, combined with recent achievements in photonics, light confinement and guiding, promises all-optical data processing, control, adaptive responsivity, and storage on photonic chips.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An and Logic Gate for Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#8208;Guided Ferroptosis Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To improve the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) efficiency and ferroptosis therapy efficacy of exceedingly small magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IO, &lt; 5&#160;nm) for tumors via enhancing the sensitivity of tumor microenvironment (TME) responsiveness, inspired by molecular logic gates, we designed and constructed a self&#8208;assembled IO with a AND logic gate function. Typically, cystamine (CA) was conjugated onto the end of poly(2&#8208;methylthio&#8208;ethanol methacrylate) (PMEMA) to generate PMEMA&#8208;CA. The PMEMA&#8208;CA was grafted onto the surface of brequinar (BQR)&#8208;loaded IO to form IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA. The self&#8208;assembled IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA (SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA) was obtained due to the hydrophobicity of PMEMA. The carbon&#8208;sulfur single bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be oxidized by the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TME to thio&#8208;oxygen double bond, resulting in the conversion from being hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The disulfide bond of PMEMA&#8208;CA can be broken by the glutathione (GSH) in TME, leading to the shedding of PMEMA from the IO surface. Under the dual actions of ROS and GSH in TME (i.e., AND logic gate), SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA can be disassembled to release IO, Fe2+/3+, and BQR. In vitro and in vivo results demonstrate the AND logic gate function and mechanism, the high T1 MRI performance and exceptional ferroptosis therapy efficacy for tumors, and the excellent biosafety of SA&#8208;IO&#8208;BQR@PMEMA.

         <title>Covalently Functionalized Nanopores for Highly Selective Separation of Monovalent Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biological ion channels possess prominent ion transport performances attributed to their critical chemical groups across the continuous nanoscale filters. However, it is still a challenge to imitate these sophisticated performances in artificial nanoscale systems. Herein, this work develops the strategy to fabricate functionalized graphene nanopores in pioneer based on the synergistic regulation of the pore size and chemical properties of atomically thin confined structure through decoupling etching combined with in&#8208;situ covalent modification. The modified graphene nanopores possess asymmetric ion transport behaviors and efficient monovalent metal ions sieving (K+/Li+ selectivity &#8764; 48.6). Meanwhile, it also allows preferential transport for cations, the resulting membranes exhibit a K+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 76 and a H+/Cl&#8722; selectivity of 59.3. The synergistic effects of steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions imposing a higher energy barrier for Cl&#8722; or Li+ to across nanopores lead to ultra&#8208;selective H+ or K+ transport. Further, the functionalized graphene nanopores generate a power density of 25.3&#160;W m&#8722;2 and a conversion efficiency of 33.9%, showing potential application prospects in energy conversion. The theoretical studies quantitatively match well with the experimental results. The feasible preparation of functionalized graphene nanopores paves the way toward direct investigation on ion transport mechanism and advanced design in devices.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Droplets Parameters Monitoring in a Microfluidic Chip via Liquid&#8208;Solid Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The monitoring of micro&#8208;droplets parameters is significant to the development of droplet microfluidics. However, existing monitoring methods have drawbacks such as high cost, interference with droplet movement, and even the potential for cross&#8208;contamination. Herein, a micro&#8208;droplets monitoring method (MDMM) based on liquid&#8208;solid triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG) is proposed, which can realize non&#8208;invasive and self&#8208;powered monitoring of micro&#8208;droplets in a microfluidic chip. The droplet frequency is monitored by voltage pulse frequency and a mathematical model is established to monitor the droplet length and velocity. Furthermore, we construct a micro&#8208;droplets sensor (MDS) based on the MDMM to carry out the experiment. The coefficients of determination (R2) of the fitting curves of the micro&#8208;droplets frequency, length, and velocity monitoring are 0.998, 0.997, and 0.995, respectively. To prove the universal applicability of the MDMM, the micro&#8208;droplets generated by different liquid media and channel structures are monitored. Eventually, a micro&#8208;droplets monitoring system is built, which can realize the counting of micro&#8208;droplets and the monitoring of droplet frequency and length. This work provides a novel approach for monitoring micro&#8208;droplets parameters, which holds the potential to advance developments in the field of microfluidics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Nanoregulator to Mitigate Dynamic Immune Evasion of Pancreatic Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advance of immunotherapy has shifted the paradigm of cancer management in clinic. Nevertheless, a considerable subset of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients marginally responds to current immunotherapy due to the occurrence of dynamic immune evasion arising from the intrinsic and therapeutic stress. In this investigation, we identified the pivotal role of pancreatic cancer&#8208;associated fibroblast (CAF)&#8208;induced fibrosis and tumor cell&#8208;mediated T&#8208;cell exhaustion in driving the dynamic immune evasion. Building upon this discovery, we herein engineered a novel peptide&#8208;drug conjugate (PDC)&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator for mitigating dynamic immune evasion of PDAC. The resulting nanoregulator could perform two&#8208;stage morphology transformation from spherical micelle to nanofiber, and subsequently from nanofiber to spherical nanoparticles. Such kind nanostructure design could facilitate differentialized delivery of CAF inhibitor in the extracellular matrix for intervening CAF&#8208;mediated tumor fibrosis, and indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 inhibitor to tumor cells for relieving IDO1&#8208;kynurenine axis&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell exhaustion. Antitumor study with the self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator elicited persistent antitumor immunity and remarkable antitumor performance in both Panc02 and KPC tumor models in vivo. Taken together, the PDC&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive nanoregulator might provide a novel avenue for enhanced PDAC immunotherapy.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Assisted Surface Modification of Lithium&#8208;Rich Manganese&#8208;Based Oxide Toward High Anionic Redox Reversibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Energy storage via anionic redox provides extra capacity for lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes at high voltage but causes gradual structural collapse and irreversible capacity loss with generation of On&#8722; (0&#8804;n&lt;2) species upon deep oxidation. Herein, the stability and reversibility of anionic redox reactions are enhanced by a simple sulfur&#8208;assisted surface modification method, which not only modulates the material's energy band allowing feasible electron release from both bonding and antibonding bands, but also traps the escaping On&#8722; via an as&#8208;constructed SnS2&#8208;x&#8208;&#963;Oy coating layer and return them to the host lattice upon discharge. The regulation of anionic redox inhibits the irreversible structural transformation and parasitic reactions, maintaining the specific capacity retention of as&#8208;modified cathode up to 94% after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1, along with outstanding voltage stability. The reported strategy incorporating energy band modulation and oxygen trapping is promising for the design and advancement of other cathodes storing energy through anion redox.

         <title>Latest Innovations in 2D Flexible Nanoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two distinct requirements of various nanomaterials, including from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures, are summarized, including where strain must be avoided, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and where strain is required, such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes.








Abstract
2D materials with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces and atomically thin layers have been shown to be capable of being incorporated into flexible electronic devices. The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned or controlled in other ways by using the intriguing strain engineering method. The latest and encouraging techniques in regard to creating flexible 2D nanoelectronics are condensed in this review. These techniques have the potential to be used in a wider range of applications in the near and long term. It is possible to use ultrathin 2D materials (graphene, BP, WTe2, VSe2 etc.) and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) in order to enable the electrical behavior of the devices to be studied. A category of materials is produced on smaller scales by exfoliating bulk materials, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth are employed on larger scales. This overview highlights two distinct requirements, which include from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures of various nanomaterials. They include where strain must be avoided and where it is required, such as solutions to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes, respectively. Finally, points&#8208;of&#8208;view about the current difficulties and possibilities in regard to using 2D materials in flexible electronics are provided.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1 &#945; Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Heart&#160;Repair and Electrical Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the SDF&#8208;1 &#945;/CXCR4 is effective for MI treatment, excessive monocytes/macrophages recruitment or activation can cause unwanted inflammation simultaneously. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling. The degradable SDF&#8208;1 &#945;@PUE hydrogel simultaneously enhances the recruitment of endogenous cells and reverses the adverse effects, which improves cardiac function and reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.








Abstract
The stromal&#8208;derived factor 1&#945;/chemokine receptor 4 (SDF&#8208;1 &#945;/CXCR4)&#160;axis contributes to myocardial protection after myocardial infarction (MI) by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, SDF&#8208;1 &#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1 &#945;@PUE) is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1 &#945;@PUE efficiently polarizes the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of connexin 43 (Cx43) expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediate an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

         <title>High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Li&#8211;S Batteries Catalytically Activated by Cerium Oxide: Performance and Failure Analysis under Lean Electrolyte Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D sulfur electrode with cotton&#8208;derived carbon as the substrate and CeOx as the catalyst is developed to achieve high sulfur mass loading and fast reaction kinetics under lean electrolyte conditions. The resulting Li&#8211;S cell is found to fail after 100&#8211;200 cycles during charging due to local short circuiting caused by Li dendrites penetrating the separator.








Abstract
Increasing sulfur mass loading and minimizing electrolyte amount remains a major challenge for the development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries, which needs to be tackled with combined efforts of materials development and mechanistic analysis. This work, following the same team's most recent identification of the potential&#8208;limiting step of Li&#8211;S batteries under lean electrolyte conditions, seeks to advance the understanding by extending it to a new catalyst and into the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;mass&#8208;loading region. CeOx nanostructures are integrated into cotton&#8208;derived carbon to develop a multifunctional 3D network that can host a large amount of active material, facilitate electron transport, and catalyze the sulfur lithiation reaction. The resulting S/CeOx/C electrode can deliver a stable areal capacity of 9&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a high sulfur loading of 14&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mg&#8722;1. This study discovers that Li||S/CeOx/C cells usually fail during charging at high current density, as a consequence of local short circuiting caused by electrochemically deposited Li dendrites penetrating through the separator, a previously overlooked failure pattern distinctive to cells operating under lean electrolyte conditions. This work highlights the importance of developing new material structures and analyzing failure mechanisms in the advancement of Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Optically Active MXenes in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
MXene&#8208;based van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have recently gained tremendous attention as prospective optical materials that combine an extraordinary optical response with tunable light&#8211;matter interactions. This Perspective puts the spotlight on MXenes as facile 2D building blocks to design vertical MXene/2D assemblies. Further exploration of MXene/2D vdW heterostructures is encouraged since they can crosscut the current limitations of light utilization.








Abstract
The vertical integration of distinct 2D materials in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures provides the opportunity for interface engineering and modulation of electronic as well as optical properties. However, scarce experimental studies reveal many challenges for vdW heterostructures, hampering the fine&#8208;tuning of their electronic and optical functionalities. Optically active MXenes, the most recent member of the 2D family, with excellent hydrophilicity, rich surface chemistry, and intriguing optical properties, are a novel 2D platform for optoelectronics applications. Coupling MXenes with various 2D materials into vdW heterostructures can open new avenues for the exploration of physical phenomena of novel quantum&#8208;confined nanostructures and devices. Therefore, the fundamental basis and recent findings in vertical vdW heterostructures composed of MXenes as a primary component and other 2D materials as secondary components are examined. Their robust designs and synthesis approaches that can push the boundaries of light&#8208;harvesting, transition, and utilization are discussed, since MXenes provide a unique playground for pursuing an extraordinary optical response or unusual light conversion features/functionalities. The recent findings are finally summarized, and a perspective for the future development of next&#8208;generation vdW multifunctional materials enriched by MXenes is provided.

         <title>Embedding Living Cells with a Mechanically Reinforced and Functionally Programmable Hydrogel Fiber Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel sheath&#8211;core living hydrogel fiber platform is introduced, wherein synthetic biology and microfluidic spinning are integrated, offering enhanced programmability, mechanical robustness, and functional diversity. The platform's innovative design allows for tailored porous architectures and improved mechanical performance, alongside applications like coloration of fibers and water pollutant detection through modified bacterial gene circuits.








Abstract
Living materials represent a new frontier in functional material design, integrating synthetic biology tools to endow materials with programmable, dynamic, and life&#8208;like characteristics. However, a major challenge in creating living materials is balancing the tradeoff between structural stability, mechanical performance, and functional programmability. To address this challenge, a sheath&#8211;core living hydrogel fiber platform that synergistically integrates living bacteria with hydrogel fibers to achieve both functional diversity and structural and mechanical robustness is proposed. In the design, microfluidic spinning is used to produce hydrogel fiber, which offers advantages in both structural and functional designability due to their hierarchical porous architectures that can be tailored and their mechanical performance that can be enhanced through a variety of post&#8208;processing approaches. By introducing living bacteria, the platform is endowed with programmable functionality and life&#8208;like capabilities. This work reconstructs the genetic circuits of living bacteria to express chromoproteins and fluorescent proteins as two prototypes that enable the coloration of living fibers and sensing water pollutants by monitoring the amount of fluorescent protein expressed. Altogether, this study establishes a structure&#8211;property&#8211;function optimized living hydrogel fiber platform, providing a new tool for accelerating the practical applications of the emerging living material systems.

         <title>G&#8208;Quadruplex&#8208;Filtered Selective Ion&#8208;to&#8208;Ion Current Amplification for Non&#8208;Invasive Ion Monitoring in Real Time</title>

         <dc:description>
Mimicking ion channeling and neuron signaling, synthesis of artificial K+&#8208;selective membrane, and its integration with the hydrogel&#8208;based ionic device are demonstrated, achieving K+&#8208;selective ion&#8208;to&#8208;ion amplification in complex biomixtures. The membrane exclusively allows K+ transport without water leakage; it is 250&#215; and 17&#215; more permeable toward K+ than Cl&#8722; and NMDG+, respectively, and permits a 500% larger K+ signal than Li+.








Abstract
Living cells efflux intracellular ions for maintaining cellular life, so intravital measurements of specific ion signals are of significant importance for studying cellular functions and pharmacokinetics. In this work, de novo synthesis of artificial K+&#8208;selective membrane and its integration with polyelectrolyte hydrogel&#8208;based open&#8208;junction ionic diode (OJID) is demonstrated, achieving a real&#8208;time K+&#8208;selective ion&#8208;to&#8208;ion current amplification in complex bioenvironments. By mimicking biological K+ channels and nerve impulse transmitters, in&#8208;line K+&#8208;binding G&#8208;quartets are introduced across freestanding lipid bilayers by G&#8208;specific hexylation of monolithic G&#8208;quadruplex, and the pre&#8208;filtered K+ flow is directly converted to amplified ionic currents by the OJID with a fast response time at 100&#160;ms intervals. By the synergistic combination of charge repulsion, sieving, and ion recognition, the synthetic membrane allows K+ transport exclusively without water leakage; it is 250&#215; and 17&#215; more permeable toward K+ than monovalent anion, Cl&#8722;, and polyatomic cation, N&#8208;methyl&#8208;d&#8208;glucamine+, respectively. The molecular recognition&#8208;mediated ion channeling provides a 500% larger signal for K+ as compared to Li+ (0.6&#215; smaller than K+) despite the same valence. Using the miniaturized device, non&#8208;invasive, direct, and real&#8208;time K+ efflux monitoring from living cell spheroids is achieved with minimal crosstalk, specifically in identifying osmotic shock&#8208;induced necrosis and drug&#8208;antidote dynamics.

         <title>Spatially Programmable Architected Materials Inspired by The Metallurgical Phase Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Programmable architected materials with capabilities of precisely storing predefined mechanical behaviors and adaptive deformation responses upon external stimulations are desirable to help increasing the performance and the organic integration of materials with surrounding environments. Here, we propose a new approach inspired by the physical metallurgical principles to allow the materials designers to not only enhance the global strength, but also precisely tune mechanical properties (such as strength, modulus and plastic deformation) locally in architected materials to create a new class of intelligent mechanical metamaterials. Such programmable materials not only have high strength and plastic deformation stability, but also the abilities to regulate the local deformation states and spatially control the internal propagation of deformation. This innovative approach also provides new and effective ways to enhance the adaptivity of the materials thanks to responsive strengths that not only makes the materials increasingly stronger, but also allows threshold&#8208;based adaptive responses to external loading.

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;based Stable And Stretchable Zn&#8208;ion Battery for Electronic Textiles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic textiles harmoniously interact with the human body and the surrounding environment, offering tremendous interest in smart wearable electronics. However, their wide application faces challenges due to the lack of stable and stretchable power electrodes/devices with multifunctional design. Herein, we report an intrinsically stretchable liquid metal&#8208;based fibrous anode for a stable Zn&#8208;ion battery (ZIB). Benefiting from the liquid feature and superior deformability of the liquid metal, optimized Zn ion concentration distribution and Zn (002) deposition behavior have been observed, which results in dendrite&#8208;free performance even under stretching. With a strain of 50%, the ZIB maintains a high capacity of 139.8 mAh cm&#8722;3 (corresponding to 83.0% of the initial value) after 300 cycles, outperforming bare Zn fiber&#8208;based ZIB. The fibrous ZIB seamlessly integrates with sensor, Joule heater and wirelessly charging device, which provides a stable power supply for human signal monitoring and personal thermal management, holding promise for the application of wearable multifunctional electronic textiles.

         <title>Unlocking the Ambient Temperature Effect on FA&#8208;based Perovskites Crystallization by In&#8208;situ Optical Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multiple cation&#8208;composited perovskites have been demonstrated as a promising approach to improving the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).[1] However, recipes developed for fabricating high&#8208;performance perovskites in laboratories are always not transferable in large&#8208;scale production, as perovskite crystallization is highly sensitive to processing conditions.[2] Here, using an in&#8208;situ optical method, we investigate the ambient temperature effect on the crystallization process in multiple cation&#8208;composited perovskites. It is found that the typical solvent&#8208;coordinated intermediate phase in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) is absent in formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), and nucleation is almost completed in FAPbI3 right after spin&#8208;coating. Interestingly, it is found that there is noticeable nuclei aggregation in FA&#8208;based perovskites even during the spin&#8208;coating process, which is usually only observed during the annealing in MAPbI3. Such aggregation is further promoted at a higher ambient temperature or in higher FA content. Instead of the general belief of stress release&#8208;induced crack formation,[3] we propose that the origin of the cracks in FA&#8208;based perovskites is due to the aggregation&#8208;induced solute depletion effect. The crystallization process deduced from the in&#8208;situ results is consistent with the consideration of formation energies of different compositions calculated by the density functional theory (DFT). This work reveals the limiting factors for achieving high&#8208;quality FA&#8208;based perovskite films and helps to unlock the existing narrow processing window for future large&#8208;scale production.

         <title>Fast Gas Adsorption Kinetics in Supraparticle&#8208;based Mof Packings with Hierarchical Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high&#8208;throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass transport limitations. Here, we address this problem by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle&#8208;based approach. We fabricate spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles by emulsion templating and use them as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. We use zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) particles as a model system and compare the gas adsorption kinetics of our hierarchical material with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. We demonstrate that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate than unstructured ZIF&#8208;8 powder. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials. In our hierarchical MOFs, large macropores between the supraparticles, smaller macropores between individual ZIF&#8208;8 primary particles, and micropores inherent to the ZIF&#8208;8 framework collude to combine large surface area, defined adsorption sites and efficient mass transport to enhance performance.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are microporous adsorbents for high-throughput gas separation. Such materials exhibit distinct adsorption characteristics owing to the flexibility of the crystal framework in a nanoparticle, which can be different from its bulk crystal. However, for practical applications, such particles need to be compacted into macroscopic pellets, creating mass transport limitations. Here, we address this problem by forming materials with structural hierarchy, using a supraparticle-based approach. We fabricate spherical supraparticles composed of nanosized MOF particles by emulsion templating and use them as the structural component forming a macroscopic material. We use zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) particles as a model system and compare the gas adsorption kinetics of our hierarchical material with conventional pellets without structural hierarchy. We demonstrate that a pellet packed with supraparticles exhibits a 30 times faster adsorption rate than unstructured ZIF-8 powder. These results underline the importance of controlling structural hierarchy to maximize the performance of existing materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;bright Heptamethine Dye Clusters Based on a Self&#8208;adaptive Co&#8208;assembly Strategy for NIR&#8208;IIb Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Despite the wide range of applications of bright NIR&#8208;II polymethine scaffolds in biomedical imaging, their solvatochromism and aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effects in aqueous solutions limit their inherent brightness using traditional encapsulation methods, and effective hydrophilization strategies are still scarce. Here, we synthesize and PEGylate a new set of Flav dyes, followed by manufacturing DSPE@FlavP2000 nanoparticles using a self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy to overcome these limitations. FlavP2000 can autonomously adjust its conformation when co&#8208;assembled with DSPE&#8208;PEG2000, resulting in high&#8208;efficiency luminescence (approximately 44.9% fluorescence of Flav in DMSO). DSPE@FlavP2000 enables NIR&#8208;IIb (&gt;1500&#160;nm) angiography with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. Notably, this co&#8208;assembly can occur in situ between FlavP2000 with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD), achieving consistent brightness as DSPE@FlavP2000 in blood or serum. The self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy can be enhanced by incorporating an IPA moiety, which dynamically binds to albumin, to prolong the dye's blood circulation time. Thus, the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; BAD is successfully applied to long&#8208;term vascular imaging and sciatic nerve imaging. Both the self&#8208;adaptive co&#8208;assembly strategy and BAD phenomenon improve the selectivity and availability of the hydrophilization methods, paving the way for efficient biological applications of polymethine dyes.

         <title>The Landscape of Biomimetic Nanovesicles in Brain Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Brain diseases, such as brain tumors, neurodegenerative diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and brain injuries, are caused by various pathophysiological changes such as excessive or impaired angiogenesis, neuroinflammation, immune activation or suppression, neurodegenerative disorders, and neurovirulent protein deposition, which poses a serious health threat. Brain disorders are often difficult to treat due to the presence of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which hinders the delivery of drugs to the brain. Biomimetic nanovesicles (BNVs), including endogenous extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from various cells and artificial nanovesicles (ANVs), possess the ability to penetrate the BBB and thus can be utilized for drug delivery to the brain. BNVs, especially endogenous EVs, are widely distributed in body fluids and usually carry various disease&#8208;related signal molecules such as proteins, RNA and DNA, and may therefore also be analyzed to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of brain diseases. This review will cover the exhaustive classification and characterization of BNVs and pathophysiological roles involved in various brain diseases, and emphatically focus on nanotechnology&#8208;integrated BNVs for brain disease theranostics, including various diagnosis strategies and precise therapeutic regulations (e.g., immunity regulation, disordered protein clearance, anti&#8208;neuroinflammation, neuro&#8208;regeneration, angiogenesis and the gut&#8208;brain axis regulation). We also discuss and outline the remaining challenges and future perspectives regarding the nanotechnology&#8208;integrated BNVs for the diagnosis and treatment of brain diseases.

         <title>Magnetic Putty as A Reconfigurable, Recyclable, And Accessible Soft Robotic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetically hard materials are widely used to build soft magnetic robots, providing large magnetic force/torque and macrodomain programmability. However, their high magnetic coercivity often presents practical challenges when attempting to reconfigure magnetization patterns, requiring a large magnetic field or heating. In this study, we introduce magnetic putty as a magnetically hard and soft material with large remanence and low coercivity. We show that the magnetization of magnetic putty can be easily reoriented with maximum magnitude using an external field that is only one tenth of its coercivity. Additionally, magnetic putty is a malleable, autonomous self&#8208;healing material that can be recycled and repurposed. We anticipate magnetic putty could provide a versatile and accessible tool to various magnetic robotics applications for fast prototyping and explorations for research and educational purposes.

         <title>Spontaneous Vortex&#8208;Antivortex Pairs And Their Topological Transitions in A Chiral&#8208;Lattice Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The spontaneous formation and topological transitions of vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs have implications for a broad range of emergent phenomena, e.g., from superconductivity to quantum computing. Unlike magnets exhibiting collinear spin textures, helimagnets with noncollinear spin textures provide unique opportunities to manipulate topological forms such as (anti)merons and (anti)skyrmions. However, it is challenging to achieve multiple topological states and their interconversion in a single helimagnet due to the topological protection for each state. Here, we report the on&#8208;demand creation of multiple topological states in a helimagnet Fe0.5Co0.5Ge, including a spontaneous vortex pair of meron with topological charge N = &#8722;1/2 and antimeron with N = 1/2, and a vortex&#8208;antivortex bundle, i. e., a bimeron (meron pair) with N = &#8722;1. We demonstrate the mutual transformation between skyrmions and bimerons with respect to the competitive effects of magnetic field and magnetic shape anisotropy. We show that electric currents drive the individual bimerons to form their connecting assembly and then into a skyrmion lattice. These findings signify the feasibility of designing topological states and offer new insights into the manipulation of noncollinear spin textures for potential applications in various fields.

         <title>4D Printing of Reprogrammable Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Synergistic Photochromism and Photoactuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4D printable photochromic titanium&#8208;based nanocrystal (TiNC)/liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) composite ink is developed, which enables reprogrammable photochromism and photoactuation of a single 4D&#8208;printed TiNC/LCE object. Through the precise control over the structural design and light irradiation, the printed object can be globally or locally programmed, erased, and reprogrammed to achieve desirable photocontrollable color patterns and 3D structure constructions.








Abstract
4D printing of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) via direct ink writing has opened up great opportunities to create stimuli&#8208;responsive actuations for applications such as soft robotics. However, most 4D&#8208;printed LCEs are limited to thermal actuation and fixed shape morphing, posing a challenge for achieving multiple programmable functionalities and reprogrammability. Here, a 4D&#8208;printable photochromic titanium&#8208;based nanocrystal (TiNC)/LCE composite ink is developed, which enables the reprogrammable photochromism and photoactuation of a single 4D&#8208;printed architecture. The printed TiNC/LCE composite exhibits reversible color&#8208;switching between white and black in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and oxygen exposure. Upon near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, the UV&#8208;irradiated region can undergo photothermal actuation, allowing for robust grasping and weightlifting. By precisely controlling the structural design and the light irradiation, the single 4D&#8208;printed TiNC/LCE object can be globally or locally programmed, erased, and reprogrammed to achieve desirable photocontrollable color patterns and 3D structure constructions, such as barcode patterns and origami&#8208; and kirigami&#8208;inspired structures. This work provides a novel concept for designing and engineering adaptive structures with unique and tunable multifunctionalities, which have potential applications in biomimetic soft robotics, smart construction engineering, camouflage, multilevel information storage, etc.

Through the precise control over the structural design and light irradiation, the printed object can be globally or locally programmed, erased, and reprogrammed to achieve desirable photocontrollable color patterns and 3D structure constructions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4D printing of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) via direct ink writing has opened up great opportunities to create stimuli-responsive actuations for applications such as soft robotics. However, most 4D-printed LCEs are limited to thermal actuation and fixed shape morphing, posing a challenge for achieving multiple programmable functionalities and reprogrammability. Here, a 4D-printable photochromic titanium-based nanocrystal (TiNC)/LCE composite ink is developed, which enables the reprogrammable photochromism and photoactuation of a single 4D-printed architecture. The printed TiNC/LCE composite exhibits reversible color-switching between white and black in response to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and oxygen exposure. Upon near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, the UV-irradiated region can undergo photothermal actuation, allowing for robust grasping and weightlifting. By precisely controlling the structural design and the light irradiation, the single 4D-printed TiNC/LCE object can be globally or locally programmed, erased, and reprogrammed to achieve desirable photocontrollable color patterns and 3D structure constructions, such as barcode patterns and origami- and kirigami-inspired structures. This work provides a novel concept for designing and engineering adaptive structures with unique and tunable multifunctionalities, which have potential applications in biomimetic soft robotics, smart construction engineering, camouflage, multilevel information storage, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Organic Batteries Using the Proton as a Charge Carrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses unique properties such as fast diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, endowing aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span, and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, as well as high safety. A comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is presented, together with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes








Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of low cost, nonflammability, and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications. Among various metal&#8208;ion/non&#8208;metallic charge carriers, the proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass, and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span, and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox&#8208;active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton&#8208;storage sites, and abundant resources, are considered attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, the charge&#8208;storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs are still in their infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H+&#8208;storage mechanisms are significant for the application of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progress on organic materials, such as small molecules and polymers for APBs, is reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially regarding their low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.

         <title>Constructing Highly Efficient Circularly Polarized Multiple&#8208;Resonance Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Materials with Intrinsically Helical Chirality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edge&#8208;topology molecular&#8208;engineering strategy is proposed to construct circularly polarized multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed &#64258;uorescence materials with intrinsically helical chirality. The enantiomers (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py&#8208;based organic light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit pure&#8208;green emission, with Commission Internationale de L&#8217;Eclairage coordinates of (0.29, 0.68), maximum external quantum efficiency exceeding 30%, and electroluminescence dissymmetry factor of approximately 4.40 &#215; 10&#8722;4.








Abstract
Advanced circularly polarized multiple&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF) materials synergize the advantages of circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), narrowband emission, and the TADF characteristic, which can be fabricated into highly efficient circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) with high color purity, directly facing the urgent market strategic demand of ultrahigh&#8208;definition and 3D displays. In this work, based on an edge&#8208;topology molecular&#8208;engineering (ETME) strategy, a pair of high&#8208;performance CP&#8208;MR&#8208;TADF enantiomers, (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, is developed, which merges the intrinsically helical chirality into the MR framework. The optimized CP&#8208;OLEDs with (P and M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py emitters and the newly developed ambipolar transport host PhCbBCz exhibit pure green emission with sharp peaks of 532&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 37&#160;nm, and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.29, 0.68). Importantly, they achieve remarkable maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 30.6% and 29.2%, and clear circularly polarized electroluminescence (CPEL) signals with electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gELs) of &#8722;4.37&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 and +4.35&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4 for (P)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py and (M)&#8208;BN&#8208;Py, respectively.

         <title>Engineering Sub&#8208;Nanometer Hafnia&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics to Break the Scaling Relation for High&#8208;Efficiency Piezocatalytic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase are synthesized. The ferroelectric polarization of flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the "scaling relationship" during piezocatalysis.








Abstract
Reversible control of ferroelectric polarization is essential to overcome the heterocatalytic kinetic limitation. This can be achieved by creating a surface with switchable electron density; however, owing to the rigidity of traditional ferroelectric oxides, achieving polarization reversal in piezocatalytic processes remains challenging. Herein, sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanowires with a polymer&#8208;like flexibility are synthesized. Oxygen K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and negative spherical aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy reveal an orthorhombic (Pca21) ferroelectric phase of the HZO sub&#8208;nanometer wires (SNWs). The ferroelectric polarization of the flexible HZO SNWs can be easily switched by slight external vibration, resulting in dynamic modulation of the binding energy of adsorbates and thus breaking the &#8220;scaling relationship&#8221; during piezocatalysis. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized ultrathin HZO nanowires display superb water&#8208;splitting activity, with H2 production rate of 25687&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under 40&#160;kHz ultrasonic vibration, which is 235&#160;and 41&#160;times higher than those of non&#8208;ferroelectric hafnium oxides and rigid BaTiO3 nanoparticles, respectively. More strikingly, the hydrogen production rates can reach 5.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 by addition of stirring exclusively.

         <title>A UV&#8208;Resistant Heterogeneous Wettability&#8208;Patterned Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. UPS enables efficient patterning stability under intense UV irradiation of 3000&#160;min.








Abstract
Preparing UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterns is critical for the practical application of surfaces with heterogeneous wettability. However, combining UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic materials on heterogeneous surfaces is challenging. Inspired by the structure of cell membranes, a UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability&#8208;patterned surface (UPS) is designed via laser ablation of the coating of multilayer structures. UV&#8208;resistant superhydrophobic silica patterns can be created in situ on surfaces covered with superhydrophilic TiO2 nanoparticles. The UV resistance time of the UPS with a TiO2&#8208;based surface is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that obtained with other surface molecular modification methods that require a mask. The cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. The UPS enables efficient patterning of functional materials under UV irradiation, controlling the wetting behavior of liquids in open&#8208;air systems. Furthermore, its heterogeneous wettability remains stable even after 50&#160;h of intense UV irradiation (365&#160;nm, 500&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2). These UV&#8208;resistant heterogeneous wettability patterned surfaces will likely be applied in microfluidics, cell culture, energy conversion, and water collection in the future.

The cell-membrane-like structure of the UPS regulates the migration of internal siloxane chain segments in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions of the surface. The UPS enables efficient patterning of functional materials under UV irradiation, controlling the wetting behavior of liquids in open-air systems. Furthermore, its heterogeneous wettability remains stable even after 50&#160;h of intense UV irradiation (365&#160;nm, 500&#160;mW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). These UV-resistant heterogeneous wettability patterned surfaces will likely be applied in microfluidics, cell culture, energy conversion, and water collection in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Appended Nanosonosensitizers Targeting Tumor Glycolysis for Synergistic Sonodynamic&#8211;Immunometabolic Therapy of Spinal&#8208;Metastasized Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum&#8208;oxide&#8208;based sonosensitizer is&#160;synthesized and integrated with a glycolysis&#8208;disturbing peptide for simultaneous sonodynamic therapy and tumor metabolic regulation. The reprogramming of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment is achieved by inhibiting glucose uptake and lactic acid secretion in the tumor glycolytic process, synergizing with sonodynamic&#8208;elicited immune activation for two&#8208;pronged sonodynamic&#8211;immunometabolic therapy.








Abstract
Despite recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy, challenges have yet to be surmounted to achieve two major goals of magnifying antitumor immunity and remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, a nanosystem (ODM&#8208;R) that integrates oxygen&#8208;deficient molybdenum oxide (ODM) nanosonosensitizers and R7 peptides with tumor metabolism regulation effects is designed and fabricated for synergistic sonodynamic&#8211;immunometabolic therapy of spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors. The ODM generates reactive oxygen species upon ultrasound irradiation to implement sonodynamic therapy (SDT), inducing cancer cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. The R7 attached on ODM markedly inhibits the uptake of glucose and excretion of lactic acid in cancer cells by perturbing the glycolysis process. The combination of SDT and tumor glycolysis obstruction by ODM&#8208;R guarantees satisfactory efficacy in synergizing with PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate spinal&#8208;metastasized tumors, achieving concurrent sonodynamic&#8208;triggered immune activation and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment remodeling. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of nanosonosensitizers for boosting cancer immunotherapy by SDT and tumor metabolic regulation.

         <title>An Ultrahighly Stretchable and Recyclable Starch&#8208;Based Gel with Multiple&#160;Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A starch&#8208;based ADM gel with high stretchability, swiftly self&#8208;healing ability, self&#8208;adhesive property, freezing resistance, moisturizing properties, and satisfactory sensing performance is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. The ADM gel with reversible hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions can be recycled by the &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and the &#8220;dissolution&#8211;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively.








Abstract
With the development of various gel&#8208;based flexible sensors, novel gels with multiple integrated and efficient properties, particularly recyclability, have been developed. Herein, a starch&#8208;based ADM (amylopectin (AP)&#8211;poly(3&#8208;[dimethyl&#8208;[2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208; enoyloxy)ethyl]azaniumyl]propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate) (PDMAPS)&#8211;MXene) gel is prepared by a facile &#8220;cooking&#8221; strategy accompanying the gelatinization of AP and polymerization reaction of zwitterionic monomers. Reversible crosslinking in the gel occurs through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. The ADM gel exhibits high stretchability (&#8776;2700%, after one month), swift self&#8208;healing performance, self&#8208;adhesive properties, favorable freezing resistance, and satisfactory moisturizing properties (&#8805;30&#160;days). Interestingly, the ADM gel can be recycled and reused by a &#8220;kneading&#8221; method and &#8220;dissolution&#8211;dialysis&#8221; process, respectively. Furthermore, the ADM gel can be assembled as a strain sensor with a broad working strain range (&#8776;800%) and quick response time (response time 211&#160;ms and recovery time 253&#160;ms, under 10% strain) to detect various macro&#8208; and micro&#8208;human&#8208;motions, even under harsh conditions such as pronunciation and handwriting. The ADM gel can also be used as a humidity sensor to investigate humidity and human respiratory status, suggesting its practical application in personal health management. This study provides a novel strategy for the preparation of high&#8208;performance recycled gels and flexible sensors.

         <title>A Wearable Touch&#8208;Activated Device Integrated with Hollow Microneedles for Continuous Sampling And Sensing of Dermal Interstitial Fluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dermal interstitial fluid (ISF) is emerging as a rich source of biomarkers that complements conventional biofluids such as blood and urine. However, the impact of ISF sampling in clinical applications has been limited owing to the challenges associated with extraction. The implementation of microneedle&#8208;based wearable devices that can extract dermal ISF in a pain&#8208;free and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use manner has attracted growing attention in recent years. Here, we introduce a fully integrated touch&#8208;activated wearable device based on a laser&#8208;drilled hollow microneedle (HMN) patch for continuous sampling and sensing of dermal ISF. The developed platform can produce and maintain the required vacuum pressure (as low as about &#8208;53&#160;kPa) to collect adequate volumes of ISF (&#8764;2&#160;&#956;L needle&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) for medical applications. The vacuum system can be activated through a one&#8208;touch finger operation. A parametric study is performed to investigate the effect of microneedle array size, vacuum pressure, and extraction duration on collected ISF. The capability of the proposed platform for continuous health monitoring is further demonstrated by the electrochemical detection of glucose and pH levels of ISF in animal models. This HMN&#8208;based system provides an alternative tool to the existing invasive techniques for ISF collection and sensing for medical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Halide Perovskites&#8208;based Diffusive Memristors for Artificial Mechano&#8208;Nociceptive System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Numerous efforts for emulating organ systems comprised of multiple functional units have driven substantial advancements in bio&#8208;realistic electronics and systems. The resistance change behavior observed in diffusive memristors shares similarities with the potential change in biological neurons. Here, the diffusive threshold switching phenomenon in Ag&#8208;incorporated organometallic halide perovskites is utilized to demonstrate the functions of afferent neurons. Halide perovskites&#8208;based diffusive memristors show a low threshold voltage of &#8764;0.2&#160;V with little variation, attributed to the facile migration of Ag ions uniformly dispersed within the halide matrix. Based on the reversible and reliable volatile threshold switching, the memristors successfully demonstrate fundamental nociceptive functions including threshold firing, relaxation, and sensitization. Furthermore, to replicate the biological mechano&#8208;nociceptive phenomenon at a system level, an artificial mechano&#8208;nociceptive system is built by integrating a diffusive memristor with a force&#8208;sensing resistor. The presented system is capable of detecting and discerning the detrimental impact caused by a heavy steel ball, effectively exhibiting the corresponding sensitization response. By further extending the single nociceptive system into a 5 &#215; 5 array, successful stereoscopic nociception of uneven impulses was achieved in the artificial skin system through array&#8208;scale sensitization. Our results represent significant progress in the field of bio&#8208;inspired electronics and systems.

         <title>Thermochromic Printable And Multicolor Polymeric Composite Based on Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (PVKs) are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications thanks to their outstanding photophysical properties and easy synthesis. Herein, a new PVK&#8208;based thermochromic composite is demonstrated. It can reversibly switch from a transparent state (transmittance &gt; 80%) at room temperature to a coloured state (transmittance &lt; 10%) at high temperature, with very fast kinetics, taking only a few seconds to go from the bleached to the colored state (and vice versa).X&#8208;ray diffraction, Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, Differential Scanning Calometry, rheological and optical measurements carried out during heating/cooling cycles reveal that thermochromism in our material is based on a reversible process of PVK disassembly/assembly mediated by intercalating polymeric chains, through the formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds between polymer and perovskite. Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, our system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions.The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120&#176;C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite.Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.

Therefore, differently from other thermochromic perovskites, that generally work with the adsorption/desorption of volatile molecules, our system is able to perform several heating/cooling cycles regardless of environmental conditions.The color and transition temperature (from 70 to 120&#176;C) can be tuned depending on the type of perovskite.Moreover, this thermochromic material is printable and can be deposited by cheap techniques, paving the way for a new class of smart coatings with an unprecedented range of colors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Insights into the Si&#8208;H Bonding Configuration at the Amorphous/Crystalline Silicon Interface of Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cells by Raman and FTIR Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology, thin layers of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) are applied as passivating contacts to the crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) wafer. Thus, the properties of the a&#8208;Si:H is crucial for the performance of the solar cells. One important property of a&#8208;Si:H is its microstructure which can be characterized by the microstructure parameter R based on Si&#8208;H bond stretching vibrations. A common method to determine R is Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption measurement which, however, is difficult to perform on solar cells by various reasons like the use of textured Si wafers and the presence of conducting oxide contact layers. Here, we demonstrate that Raman spectroscopy is suitable to determine the microstructure of bulk a&#8208;Si:H layers of 10&#160;nm or less on textured c&#8208;Si underneath indium tin oxide as conducting oxide. We perform a detailed comparison of FTIR and Raman spectra and find significant differences of the microstructure parameter obtained by both methods with decreasing a&#8208;Si:H film thickness.

         <title>Defect Engineering&#8208;Mediated Long&#8208;Lived Charge Transfer Excited State in Fe&#8208;gallate Complex Improves Iron Cycle And Enables Sustainable Fenton&#8208;like Reaction</title>

Abstract
Fenton reactions are inefficient because the Fe(II) catalyst cannot be recycled in time due to the lack of a rapid electron transport pathway. This result in huge H2O2 wastage in industrial applications. Here, we show a sustainable heterogeneous Fenton system is attainable by enhancing ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer (LMCT) excited&#8208;state lifetime in Fe&#8208;gallate complex. By engineering oxygen defects in the complex, we improved the lifetime from 10 to 90 picoseconds. The lengthened lifetime ensured sufficient concentrations of excited states for efficient Fe cycle, realizing previously unattainable H2O2 activation kinetics and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) productivity. Spectroscopic and electrochemical studies show the cyclic reaction mechanism involves in situ Fe(II) regeneration and synchronous supply of oxygen atoms from water to recover dissociated Fe&#8208;O bonds. Trace amounts of our catalyst effectively destroyed two drug&#8208;resistant bacteria even after 8 reaction cycles. Our work reveals the link between LMCT excited&#8208;state lifetime, Fe cycle, and catalytic activity and stability, with implications for de novo design of efficient and sustainable Fenton process.

         <title>Suppressing Rampant and Vertical Deposition of Cathode Intermediate Product via Ph Regulation Towards Large&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Durability Zn//MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite great prospects, Zn//MnO2 batteries suffer from rampant and vertical deposition of zinc sulfate hydroxide (ZSH) at the cathode surface, which leads to a significant impact on their electrochemical performance. This phenomenon is primarily due to the drastic increase in the electrolyte pH value upon discharging, which is closely associated with the electrodissolution of Mn&#8208;based active materials. Herein, the pH value change is effectively inhibited by employing an electrolyte additive with excellent pH buffering capability. As such, the formation of ZSH at the cathode is postponed, resulting in the deposition of ZSH in a horizontal arrangement. This strategy can significantly enhance the utilization efficiency of cathode active material, while also enabling a solid electrolyte interphase layer at the Zn anode to address low Zn stripping/plating reversibility. With the optimal electrolyte, the Zn//MnO2 battery realizes a 25.6% increase in the specific capacity at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 compared to that with the baseline electrolyte, great rate capability (161.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and superior capacity retention (90.2% over 5,000 cycles). In addition, the pH buffering strategy is highly applicable in hydrogel electrolytes. This work underscores the importance of pH regulation for Zn//MnO2 batteries and provides enlightening insights.

         <title>Non&#8208;Linear Optics at Twist Interfaces in h&#8208;BN/SiC Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Understanding the emergent electronic structure in twisted atomically thin layers has led to the exciting field of twistronics. However, practical applications of such systems are challenging since the specific angular correlations between the layers must be precisely controlled and the layers have to be single crystalline with uniform atomic ordering. Here, we&#160;suggest an alternative, simple and scalable approach where nanocrystalline two&#8208;dimensional (2D) film on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrates yield twisted&#8208;interface&#8208;dependent properties. Ultrawide&#8208;bandgap hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) thin films are directly grown on high in&#8208;plane lattice mismatched wide&#8208;bandgap silicon carbide (4H&#8208;SiC) substrates to explore the twist&#8208;dependent structure&#8208;property correlations. Concurrently, nanocrystalline h&#8208;BN thin film shows strong non&#8208;linear second&#8208;harmonic generation and ultra&#8208;low cross&#8208;plane thermal conductivity at room temperature, which are attributed to the twisted domain edges between van der Waals stacked nanocrystals with random in&#8208;plane orientations. First&#8208;principles calculations based on time&#8208;dependent density functional theory manifest strong even&#8208;order optical nonlinearity in twisted h&#8208;BN layers. Our&#160;work unveils that directly deposited 2D nanocrystalline thin film on 3D substrates could provide easily accessible twist&#8208;interfaces, therefore enabling a simple and scalable approach to utilize the 2D&#8208;twistronics integrated in 3D material devices for next&#8208;generation nanotechnology.

         <title>Phase Engineering of 2D Spinel&#8208;Type Manganese Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic strategy to phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides with thicknesses down to one unit cell is proposed. A unique combination of ferromagnetic and semiconducting properties is demonstrated. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, a Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA Hz&#8722;1/2.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials have been of interest due to their unique long&#8208;range magnetic ordering in the low&#8208;dimensional regime and potential applications in spintronics. Currently, most studies are focused on strippable van der Waals magnetic materials with layered structures, which typically suffer from a poor stability and scarce species. Spinel oxides have a good environmental stability and rich magnetic properties. However, the isotropic bonding and close&#8208;packed nonlayered crystal structure make their 2D growth challenging, let alone the phase engineering. Herein, a phase&#8208;controllable synthesis of 2D single&#8208;crystalline spinel&#8208;type oxides is reported. Using the van der Waals epitaxy strategy, the thicknesses of the obtained tetragonal and hexagonal manganese oxide (Mn3O4) nanosheets can be tuned down to 7.1&#160;nm and one unit cell (0.7&#160;nm), respectively. The magnetic properties of these two phases are evaluated using vibrating&#8208;sample magnetometry and first&#8208;principle calculations. Both structures exhibit a Curie temperature of 48 K. Owing to its ultrathin geometry, the Mn3O4 nanosheet exhibits a superior ultraviolet detection performance with an ultralow noise power density of 0.126 pA Hz&#8722;1/2. This study broadens the range of 2D magnetic semiconductors and highlights their potential applications in future information devices.

         <title>A Memristors&#8208;Based Dendritic Neuron&#160;for High&#8208;Efficiency Spatial&#8208;Temporal Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the microscopic dynamics in biological system, a dynamic memristor as an artificial dendrite and a Mott memristor as a spike&#8208;firing soma are integrated to construct a dendritic neuron for high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Furthermore, a bio&#8208;plausible dendritic neural network is hardware implemented to demonstrate human&#8208;motion recognition, showing nearly 20% improvement in accuracy and 1000&#215;&#160;higher powerefficiency than a&#160;graphics processing unit.








Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in memristors based on transition metal oxide are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a titanium oxide (TiOx)&#8208;based interface&#8208;type dynamic memristor and an niobium oxide (NbOx)&#8208;based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike&#8208;firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware&#8208;implemented for spatial&#8208;temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the Nanyang Technological University&#8208;Red Green Blue&#160;(NTU&#8208;RGB) dataset as a benchmark spatial&#8208;temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors&#8208;based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000&#215; advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the graphics processing unit (GPU). The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio&#8208;plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial&#8208;temporal tasks with high efficiency.

The paradigm of in&#8208;sensor computing integrates computing functions into sensory networks, exhibiting high speed, energy efficiency, and computation throughout. The hardware implementation of in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels, and their integration technology are discussed, and perspectives on future development of in&#8208;sensor computing are provided.








Abstract
The number of sensor nodes in the Internet of Things is growing rapidly, leading to a large volume of data generated at sensory terminals. Frequent data transfer between the sensors and computing units causes severe limitations on the system performance in terms of energy efficiency, speed, and security. To efficiently process a substantial amount of sensory data, a novel computation paradigm that can integrate computing functions into sensor networks should be developed. The in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm reduces data transfer and also decreases the high computing complexity by processing data locally. Here, the hardware implementation of the in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels is discussed. The physical mechanisms that lead to unique sensory response characteristics and their corresponding computing functions are illustrated. In particular, bioinspired device characteristics enable the implementation of the functionalities of neuromorphic computation. The integration technology is also discussed and the perspective on the future development of in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Probabilistic Neural Computing with Stochastic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern computing assumes that materials, devices, and circuits will be operated in a fully deterministic manner, providing predictable and reliable outputs, with any desired random behavior re&#8208;introduced in software. This perspective describes how the integration of tunable stochastic devices into neuromorphic computing architectures can allow future microelectronics to enable more efficient probabilistic computing calculations for scientific computing and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications.








Abstract
The brain has effectively proven a powerful inspiration for the development of computing architectures in which processing is tightly integrated with memory, communication is event&#8208;driven, and analog computation can be performed at scale. These neuromorphic systems increasingly show an ability to improve the efficiency and speed of scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. Herein, it is proposed that the brain's ubiquitous stochasticity represents an additional source of inspiration for expanding the reach of neuromorphic computing to probabilistic applications. To date, many efforts exploring probabilistic computing have focused primarily on one scale of the microelectronics stack, such as implementing probabilistic algorithms on deterministic hardware or developing probabilistic devices and circuits with the expectation that they will be leveraged by eventual probabilistic architectures. A co&#8208;design vision is described by which large numbers of devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and tunnel diodes, can be operated in a stochastic regime and incorporated into a scalable neuromorphic architecture that can impact a number of probabilistic computing applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian neural networks. Finally, a framework is presented to categorize increasingly advanced hardware&#8208;based probabilistic computing technologies.

         <dc:description>
Unlike two&#8208;terminal memristors, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) tunes conductance through ion injection into the channel through a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the challenging fundamental questions, and how ECRAM could be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low power neuromorphic computing are reviewed.








Abstract
Non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann computing using neuromorphic systems based on two&#8208;terminal resistive nonvolatile memory elements has emerged as a promising approach, but its full potential has not been realized due to the lack of materials and devices with the appropriate attributes. Unlike memristors, which require large write currents to drive phase transformations or filament growth, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) decouples the &#8220;write&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; operations using a &#8220;gate&#8221; electrode to tune the conductance state through charge&#8208;transfer reactions, and every electron transferred through the external circuit in ECRAM corresponds to the migration of &#8776;1 ion used to store analogue information. Like static dopants in traditional semiconductors, electrochemically inserted ions modulate the conductivity by locally perturbing a host's electronic structure; however, ECRAM does so in a dynamic and reversible manner. The resulting change in conductance can span orders of magnitude, from gradual increments needed for analog elements, to large, abrupt changes for dynamically reconfigurable adaptive architectures. In this in&#8208;depth perspective, the history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the rich portfolio of challenging, fundamental questions, and how ECRAM can be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing are discussed.

         <title>Energy and Space Efficient Parallel Adder Using Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The largest functional crossbars incorporating molecular materials to date are fabricated, in which all the memristors are consistent, robust, and reliable. An 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders are experimentally demonstrated. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit adder with 268&#160;million inputs is simulated that outperformed a multicore complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) platform.








Abstract
A breakthrough in in&#8208;memory computing technologies hinges on the development of appropriate material platforms that can overcome their existing limitations, such as larger than optimal footprint and multiple serial computational steps, with potential accumulation of errors. Using a molecular switching element with multiple non&#8208;monotonic and deterministic transitions, the device count and the number of computational steps can be substantially reduced. With molecular materials, however, the realization of a reliable and robust platform is&#160;an unattained goal for decades. Here, crossbar arrays with up to 64 molecular memristors are fabricated to experimentally demonstrate 8&#8208;bit serial and 4&#8208;bit parallel adders&#160;that operate for thousands of measurement cycles with an estimated error probability of 10&#8722;16. For performance benchmarking, a 32&#8208;bit parallel adder is designed and simulated with 268&#160;million inputs including contributions from the peripheral circuitry showing a 47&#215; higher energy efficiency, 93&#215; faster operation, and 9% of the footprint, leading to 4390 times improved energy&#8211;delay product compared to a special purpose complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;based multicore adder.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough in in-memory computing technologies hinges on the development of appropriate material platforms that can overcome their existing limitations, such as larger than optimal footprint and multiple serial computational steps, with potential accumulation of errors. Using a molecular switching element with multiple non-monotonic and deterministic transitions, the device count and the number of computational steps can be substantially reduced. With molecular materials, however, the realization of a reliable and robust platform is&#160;an unattained goal for decades. Here, crossbar arrays with up to 64 molecular memristors are fabricated to experimentally demonstrate 8-bit serial and 4-bit parallel adders&#160;that operate for thousands of measurement cycles with an estimated error probability of 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;16&lt;/sup&gt;. For performance benchmarking, a 32-bit parallel adder is designed and simulated with 268&#160;million inputs including contributions from the peripheral circuitry showing a 47&#215; higher energy efficiency, 93&#215; faster operation, and 9% of the footprint, leading to 4390 times improved energy&#8211;delay product compared to a special purpose complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)-based multicore adder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanism and Impact of Bipolar Current Voltage Asymmetry in Computational Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonvolatile memristive memory devices are emerging computational blocks for brain&#8208;inspired and in&#8208;memory computing. Using examples of phase&#8208;change memory, it is shown that there is a previously overlooked non&#8208;ideality of the bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent current flow that can impact the numerical computational precision achievable for useful matrix&#8208;vector multiplication operations.








Abstract
Nanoscale resistive memory devices are being explored for neuromorphic and in&#8208;memory computing. However, non&#8208;ideal device characteristics of read noise and resistance drift pose significant challenges to the achievable computational precision. Here, it is shown that there is an additional non&#8208;ideality that can impact computational precision, namely the bias&#8208;polarity&#8208;dependent current flow. Using phase&#8208;change memory (PCM) as a model system, it is shown that this &#8220;current&#8211;voltage&#8221; non&#8208;ideality arises both from the material and geometrical properties of the devices. Further, we&#160;discuss the detrimental effects of such bipolar asymmetry on in&#8208;memory matrix&#8208;vector multiply (MVM) operations and provide a scheme to compensate for&#160;it.

         <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Memory Devices Using Ultrafast, Non&#8208;Volatile Phase&#8208;Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrated photonic memory based on a novel phase&#8208;change material&#8212;namely, Sc0.2Sb2Te3 (SST)&#8212;showing distinct optical contrast between two stable phases, amorphous and crystalline states is reported. Using an optical pulse as fast as 2 ns, information can be written and erased in the photonic memory. This ultrafast photonic memory has enormous application potential in photonic computing and neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
The search for ultrafast photonic memory devices is inspired by the ever&#8208;increasing number of cloud&#8208;computing, supercomputing, and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications, together with the unique advantages of signal processing in the optical domain such as high speed, large bandwidth, and low energy consumption. By embracing silicon photonics with chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), non&#8208;volatile integrated photonic memory is developed with promising potential in photonic integrated circuits and nanophotonic applications. While conventional PCMs suffer from slow crystallization speed, scandium&#8208;doped antimony telluride (SST) has been recently developed for ultrafast phase&#8208;change random&#8208;access memory applications. An ultrafast non&#8208;volatile photonic memory based on an SST thin film with a 2 ns write/erase speed is demonstrated, which is the fastest write/erase speed ever reported in integrated phase&#8208;change photonic devices. SST&#8208;based photonic memories exhibit multilevel capabilities and good stability at room temperature. By mapping the memory level to the biological synapse weight, an artificial neural network based on photonic memory devices is successfully established for image classification. Additionally, a reflective nanodisplay application using SST with optoelectronic modulation capabilities is demonstrated. Both the optical and electrical changes in SST during the phase transition and the fast&#8208;switching speed demonstrate their potential for use in photonic computing, neuromorphic computing, nanophotonics, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Molecular Interactions in a Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By maneuvering the supramolecular dynamics in a molecular memristor, a wide variation of functionalities starting from diode and passing between nonvolatile and volatile, unipolar and bipolar memristors with sharp and gradual transitions within a single circuit element is captured. A mathematical design space evolves thereof that can enable almost all possible characteristic variations, desirable in neuromorphic devices.








Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular&#8208;circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multidimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity is not cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand are designed, and current&#8211;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 K with different cooling protocols are performed. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affect the electronic transport can be controlled. Operating conditions are designed where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, nonvolatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions are captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolves, thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic can be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusive memristors with highly uniform and widely tunable relaxation time are demonstrated. The dynamic relaxation behavior of such diffusive memristors is used as exponential decay kernels to implement the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm for high&#8208;accuracy event&#8208;based pattern recognition.








Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device relaxation dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, the device stack is engineered to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963; reduced from &#8776;12 to &#8776;0.32&#160;ms). The memristor is further connected with a resistor or a capacitor and the relaxation time is tuned between 1.13 &#181;s and 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. The hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm, to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation, is implemented. An accuracy of 77.3% is achieved in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. The work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

         <title>One&#8208;Phototransistor&#8211;One&#8208;Memristor Array with High&#8208;Linearity Light&#8208;Tunable Weight for Optic Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor array is proposed that works as an artificial optic neural network for image recognition. The device shows highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable conductance weight during the online training process of the optic artificial neural network and yields a recognition accuracy of 99.33% after only ten training epochs, indicating the potential in highly efficient optic neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy&#8208;efficient artificial&#8208;vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross&#8208;talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, a highly&#160;linear, light&#8208;tunable, cross&#8208;talk&#8208;free, and silicon&#8208;compatible one&#8208;phototransistor&#8211;one&#8208;memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor is experimentally demonstrated for the implementation of an optic artificial neural network (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment, an OANN is constructed using a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it is trained on an online platform. The model yields an accuracy of 99.3% after only ten training epochs. The 1PT1R memristor, which shows good performance, demonstrates its ability as an excellent hardware solution for highly efficient optic neuromorphic and edge computing.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advances in optic neuromorphic devices have led to a subsequent rise in use for construction of energy-efficient artificial-vision systems. The widespread use can be attributed to their ability to capture, store, and process visual information from the environment. The primary limitations of existing optic neuromorphic devices include nonlinear weight updates, cross-talk issues, and silicon process incompatibility. In this study, a highly&#160;linear, light-tunable, cross-talk-free, and silicon-compatible one-phototransistor&#8211;one-memristor (1PT1R) optic memristor is experimentally demonstrated for the implementation of an optic artificial neural network (OANN). For optic image recognition in the experiment, an OANN is constructed using a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;3 1PT1R memristor array, and it is trained on an online platform. The model yields an accuracy of 99.3% after only ten training epochs.

         <title>An Aqueous Analog MAC Machine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 16 &#215; 16 array of ionic transistors that electrochemically functions in aqueous quinone solution is reported. It executes analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This demonstrates the use of ions in the aqueous milieu for analog computing is a step toward developing a more complex bioinspired information processing platforms.








Abstract
Using ions in aqueous milieu for signal processing, like in biological circuits, may potentially lead to a bioinspired information processing platform. Studies, however, have focused on individual ionic diodes and transistors rather than circuits comprising many such devices. Here a 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of new ionic transistors is developed in an aqueous quinone solution. Each transistor features a concentric ring electrode pair with a disk electrode at the center. The electrochemistry of these electrodes in the solution provides the basis for the transistor operation. The ring pair electrochemically tunes the local electrolytic concentration to modulate the disk's Faradaic reaction rate. Thus, the disk current as a Faradaic reaction to the disk voltage is gated by the ring pair. The 16&#160;&#215;&#160;16 array of these transistors performs analog multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations, a computing modality hotly pursued for low&#8208;power artificial neural networks. This exploits the transistor's operating regime where the disk current is a multiplication of the disk voltage and a weight parameter tuned by the ring pair gating. Such disk currents from multiple transistors are summated in a global reference electrode to complete a MAC task. This ionic circuit demonstrating analog computing is a step toward sophisticated aqueous ionics.

         <title>Reservoir Computing with Charge&#8208;Trap Memory Based on a MoS2 Channel for Neuromorphic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a&#160;charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) based on MoS2 where the memory operation arises thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. The CTM device displays synaptic potentiation/depression induced by pulses applied to the gate or drain terminal with excellent linearity. The synaptic characteristics are used in a reservoir computing system for visual pattern recognition, which makes MoS2&#8208;based CT emerge as one of the most promising technologies&#160;for neuromorphic engineering.








Abstract
Novel memory devices are essential for developing low power, fast, and accurate in&#8208;memory computing and neuromorphic engineering concepts that can compete with the conventional complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS) digital processors. 2D semiconductors provide a novel platform for advanced semiconductors with atomic thickness, low&#8208;current operation, and capability of 3D integration. This work presents a charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) device with a MoS2 channel where memory operation arises, thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. Transistor operation, memory characteristics, and synaptic potentiation/depression for neuromorphic applications are demonstrated. The CTM device shows outstanding linearity of the potentiation by applied drain pulses of equal amplitude. Finally, pattern recognition is demonstrated by reservoir computing where the input pattern is applied as a stimulation of the MoS2&#8208;based CTMs, while the output current after stimulation is processed by a feedforward readout network. The good accuracy, the low current operation, and the robustness to input random bit flip makes the CTM device a promising technology for future high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing concepts.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Thermal Characterization of Dynamical VO2 Memristors via Local Activity Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact model connecting measurable material properties and device dimensions to circuit behavior of locally active memristors is presented, thus enabling rapid screening of neuromorphic materials for desired applications.








Abstract
Translating the surging interest in neuromorphic electronic components, such as those based on nonlinearities near Mott transitions, into large&#8208;scale commercial deployment faces steep challenges in the current lack of means to identify and design key material parameters. These issues are exemplified by the difficulties in connecting measurable material properties to device behavior via circuit element models. Here, the principle of local activity is used to build a model of VO2/SiN Mott threshold switches by sequentially accounting for constraints from a minimal set of quasistatic and dynamic electrical and high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution thermal data obtained via in situ thermoreflectance mapping. By combining independent data sets for devices with varying dimensions, the model is distilled to measurable material properties, and device scaling laws are established. The model can accurately predict electrical and thermal conductivities and capacitances and locally active dynamics (especially persistent spiking self&#8208;oscillations). The systematic procedure by which this model is developed has been a missing link in predictively connecting neuromorphic device behavior with their underlying material properties, and should enable rapid screening of material candidates before employing expensive manufacturing processes and testing procedures.

         <title>Memristive Field&#8208;Programmable Analog Arrays for Analog Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field Programmable Analog Array (FPAA) is the analog counterpart of Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). FPAA can be used to quickly prototyping analog circuit designs and greatly enhance analog computing development. A memristor based FPAA (memFPAA) has been demonstrated in this work with memristive devices and arrays serving as multiple core analog components, ranging from programmable analog resistors, routing networks, and analog vector&#8208;matrix multipliers.








Abstract
The increasing interests in analog computing nowadays call for multipurpose analog computing platforms with reconfigurability. The advancement of analog computing, enabled by novel electronic elements like memristors, has shown its potential to sustain the exponential growth of computing demand in the new era of analog data deluge. Here, a platform of a memristive field&#8208;programmable analog array (memFPAA) is experimentally demonstrated with memristive devices serving as a variety of core analog elements and CMOS components as peripheral circuits. The memFPAA is reconfigured to implement a first&#8208;order band pass filter, an audio equalizer, and an acoustic mixed frequency classifier, as application examples. The memFPAA, featured with programmable analog memristors, memristive routing networks, and memristive vector&#8208;matrix multipliers, opens opportunities for fast prototyping analog designs as well as efficient analog applications in signal processing and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Tunable Intervalence Charge Transfer in Ruthenium Prussian Blue Analog Enables Stable and Efficient Biocompatible Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cyanide&#8208;linked ruthenium coordination framework undergoes a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold change in electronic conductivity in response to electrochemical charging or redox reaction with dopamine, enabling battery&#8208;transistor synaptic nonvolatile memory devices that switch via electrical impulses or dopamine reaction. (Electro)chemically tunable mixed valence states dictate the degree of electron delocalization.








Abstract
Emerging concepts for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and brain&#8208;computer interfacing inspire new research avenues aimed at understanding the relationship between oxidation state and conductivity in unexplored materials. This report expands the materials playground for neuromorphic devices to include a mixed valence inorganic 3D coordination framework, a ruthenium Prussian blue analog (RuPBA), for flexible and biocompatible artificial synapses that reversibly switch conductance by more than four orders of magnitude based on electrochemically tunable oxidation state. The electrochemically tunable degree of mixed valency and electronic coupling between N&#8208;coordinated Ru sites controls the carrier concentration and mobility, as supported by density functional theory computations and application of electron transfer theory to in situ spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer. Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity, and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine&#8208;mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain&#8208;computer interfacing.

Neuromorphic Computing
Programmable analog memories based on emerging materials enable neuromorphic circuits capable of growing like biological intelligent systems. In the near future, such neuromorphic circuits implemented with nonvolatile static memories are expected to be able to accelerate machine&#8208;learning algorithms with much improved energy efficiency and throughput over traditional digital systems. In the long run, these neuromorphic circuits implemented with dynamic memristors may eventually realize mortal computers.

Probabilistic Neuromorphic Computing
Unlike modern computers that are engineered to be fully deterministic, the brain leverages stochasticity at immense scales to achieve energy&#8208;efficient intelligence. In article number 2204569, Shashank Misra, James B. Aimone, and co&#8208;workers describe how the incorporation of materials and devices that exhibit stochastic behaviors into brain&#8208;inspired circuits can enable neuromorphic systems that natively perform probabilistic computations.

Designing artificial neurons and synapses with on demand properties is considered crucial for the development of new&#8208;type hardware for the future neuromorphic computing. This review discusses the common electrochemical fundamentals between biological and redox&#8208;based memristive cells and the ways to control and tune the device functionalities. Examples on recent achievements in the array implementation of these systems are provided.








Abstract
Artificial neurons and synapses are considered essential for the progress of the future brain&#8208;inspired computing, based on beyond von Neumann architectures. Here, a discussion on the common electrochemical fundamentals of biological and artificial cells is provided, focusing on their similarities with the redox&#8208;based memristive devices. The driving forces behind the functionalities and the ways to control them by an electrochemical&#8208;materials approach are presented. Factors such as the chemical symmetry of the electrodes, doping of the solid electrolyte, concentration gradients, and excess surface energy are discussed as essential to understand, predict, and design artificial neurons and synapses. A variety of two&#8208; and three&#8208;terminal memristive devices and memristive architectures are presented and their application for solving various problems is shown. The work provides an overview of the current understandings on the complex processes of neural signal generation and transmission in both biological and artificial cells and presents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications, including signal transmission between biological and artificial cells. This example is showcasing the possibility for creating bioelectronic interfaces and integrating artificial circuits in biological systems. Prospectives and challenges of the modern technology toward low&#8208;power, high&#8208;information&#8208;density circuits are highlighted.

         <title>Complex Oxides for Brain&#8208;Inspired Computing: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Computers inspired by the brain offer the exciting prospect of energy efficiency. Complex oxides can serve as building blocks for brain&#8208;inspired computing owing to their adaptive electronic structure and high sensitivity to environmental stimuli.








Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence (AI) seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. In this review, the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions, and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature, are discussed. The review begins with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect highlighted is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. The focus then turns to collective phenomena, such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions (MITs), ferroelectricity, and related examples, to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure, and in situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices are then discussed. The implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design is then revewed. Finally, outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms, which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing, are highlighted.

         <title>Compute in&#8208;Memory with Non&#8208;Volatile Elements for Neural Networks: A Review from a Co&#8208;Design Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep learning drives an increasing demand on compute resources. A key operation, matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplication, can potentially be accelerated using cross&#8208;bar interconnects with nodal non&#8208;volatile memory. However, its application today is limited by the properties of the memory elements. Taking a co&#8208;design view, this review addresses the interdependencies of materials and architecture for such cross&#8208;bar hardware for training and inference.








Abstract
Deep learning has&#160;become ubiquitous, touching daily lives across the globe. Today, traditional computer architectures are stressed to their limits in efficiently executing the growing complexity of data and models. Compute&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM) can potentially play an important role in developing efficient hardware solutions that reduce data movement from compute&#8208;unit to memory, known as the von Neumann bottleneck. At its heart is a cross&#8208;bar architecture with nodal non&#8208;volatile&#8208;memory elements that performs an analog multiply&#8208;and&#8208;accumulate operation, enabling the matrix&#8208;vector&#8208;multiplications repeatedly used in all neural network workloads. The memory materials can significantly influence final system&#8208;level characteristics and chip performance, including speed, power, and classification accuracy. With an over&#8208;arching co&#8208;design viewpoint, this review assesses the use of cross&#8208;bar based CIM for neural networks, connecting the material properties and the associated design constraints and demands to application, architecture, and performance. Both digital and analog memory are considered, assessing the status for training and inference, and providing metrics for the collective set of properties non&#8208;volatile memory materials will need to demonstrate for a successful CIM technology.

         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the latest research progress on artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials. The neuronal dynamics demonstrated in these devices, the hardware implementation of various artificial neural networks, and their potentials in computational and sensing applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Artificial neuronal devices are critical building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems and currently the subject of intense research motivated by application needs from new computing technology and more realistic brain emulation. Researchers have proposed a range of device concepts that can mimic neuronal dynamics and functions. Although the switching physics and device structures of these artificial neurons are largely different, their behaviors can be described by several neuron models in a more unified manner. In this paper, the reports of artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials are reviewed from the perspective of the demonstrated neuron models, with a focus on the neuronal functions implemented in these devices and the exploitation of these functions for computational and sensing applications. Furthermore, the neuroscience inspirations and engineering methods to enrich the neuronal dynamics that remain to be implemented in artificial neuronal devices and networks toward realizing the full functionalities of biological neurons are discussed.

Abstract

         <title>Electrochemical Ionic Synapses: Progress and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical ionic synapses (EISs) are programmable resistors whose conductivity is controlled deterministically by electrochemical charge insertion. Their repeatable conductance modulation and low energy consumption render them promising for enabling analog deep learning architectures with uncompromised accuracy and superior energy efficiency. Here, we&#160;present the progress on EIS devices in the field, a physical model to provide guidelines for targeted material properties, and strategies for further advancing these devices.








Abstract
Artificial neural networks based on crossbar arrays of analog programmable resistors can address the high energy challenge of conventional hardware in artificial intelligence applications. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art two&#8208;terminal resistive switching devices based on conductive filament formation suffer from high variability and poor controllability. Electrochemical ionic synapses are three&#8208;terminal devices that operate by electrochemical and dynamic insertion/extraction of ions that control the electronic conductivity of a channel in a single solid&#8208;solution phase. They are promising candidates for programmable resistors in crossbar arrays because they have shown uniform and deterministic control of electronic conductivity based on ion doping, with very low energy consumption. Here, the desirable specifications of these programmable resistors are presented. Then, an overview of the current progress of devices based on Li+, O2&#8722;, and H+ ions and material systems is provided. Achieving nanosecond speed, low operation voltage (&#8776;1&#160;V), low energy consumption, with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor compatibility all simultaneously remains a challenge. Toward this goal, a physical model of the device is constructed to provide guidelines for the desired material properties to overcome the remaining challenges. Finally, an outlook is provided, including strategies to advance materials toward the desirable properties and the future opportunities for electrochemical ionic synapses.

         <dc:description>
Optically addressable neuromorphic devices and systems are proposed as alternatives for next&#8208;generation visual perception applications. This review covers recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite based materials have emerged over the past few decades as remarkable solution&#8208;processable optoelectronic materials with many intriguing properties and potential applications. These emerging materials have recently been considered for their promise in low&#8208;energy memory and information processing applications. In particular, their large optical cross&#8208;sections, high photoconductance contrast, large carrier&#8208;diffusion lengths, and mixed electronic/ionic transport mechanisms are attractive for enabling memory elements and neuromorphic devices that are written and/or read in the optical domain. Here, recent progress toward memory and neuromorphic functionality in metal halide perovskite materials and devices where photons are used as a critical degree of freedom for switching, memory, and neuromorphic functionality is reviewed.

         <title>From Ferroelectric Material Optimization to Neuromorphic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>

Ferroelectric materials combine a voltage driven switching mechanism with nonvolatility making them promising for nonvolatile devices. Here the material basics and the three different memory devices are described as a starting point for an in&#8208;depth discussion of the current status of implementing ferroelectric devices for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Due to the voltage driven switching at low voltages combined with nonvolatility of the achieved polarization state, ferroelectric materials have a unique potential for low power nonvolatile electronic devices. The competitivity of such devices is hindered by compatibility issues of well&#8208;known ferroelectrics with established semiconductor technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide changed this situation. The natural application of nonvolatile devices is as a memory cell. Nonvolatile memory devices also built the basis for other applications like in&#8208;memory or neuromorphic computing. Three different basic ferroelectric devices can be constructed: ferroelectric capacitors, ferroelectric field effect transistors and ferroelectric tunneling junctions. In this article first the material science of the ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide will be summarized with a special focus on tailoring the switching characteristics towards different applications.The current status of nonvolatile ferroelectric memories then lays the ground for looking into applications like in&#8208;memory computing. Finally, a special focus will be given to showcase how the basic building blocks of spiking neural networks, the neuron and the synapse, can be realized and how they can be combined to realize neuromorphic computing systems. A summary, comparison with other technologies like resistive switching devices and an outlook completes the paper.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 37, September 14, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
VO2 manifests a remarkable metal&#8211;insulator transition that affords the nonlinear, dynamical response needed to emulate the function of biological neurons and synapses. Neuromorphic function is tunable through site&#8208;selective modification, stress, tuning of interfaces, and modification of external circuit elements. Strategies for modulating transformation characteristics are reviewed and inverse design approaches across decades of length and time scales are outlined.








Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by colocating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8211;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. Strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings, are discussed. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in situ processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. Mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics, is emphasized. Opportunities are highlighted for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

         <title>Boron and Nitrogen Isotope Effects on Hexagonal Boron Nitride Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising two&#8208;dimensional material for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here we report on the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in both boron and nitrogen. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural concentration (approximately 20 at% 10B, 80 at% 11B) while using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at% 14N, 0.4 at% 15N), i.e., almost pure 14N. In this study, we extend the class of isotopically&#8208;purified hBN crystals to 15N. Crystals in the four configurations, namely h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N, were grown by the metal flux method using boron and nitrogen single isotope (&gt;99%) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium as the solvent. In&#8208;depth Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies demonstrate the high quality of the monoisotopic hBN crystals with vibrational and optical properties of the 15N&#8208;purified crystals at the state of the art of currently available 14N&#8208;purified hBN. The growth of high&#8208;quality h10B14N, h11B14N, h10B15N, and h11B15N opens exciting perspectives for thermal conductivity control in heat management, as well as for advanced functionalities in quantum technologies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique physical, mechanical, chemical, optical, and electronic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) make it a promising two-dimensional material for electronic, optoelectronic, nanophotonic, and quantum devices. Here we report on the changes in hBN's properties induced by isotopic purification in both boron and nitrogen. Previous studies on isotopically pure hBN have focused on purifying the boron isotope concentration in hBN from its natural concentration (approximately 20 at% &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, 80 at% &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B) while using naturally abundant nitrogen (99.6 at% &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, 0.4 at% &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N), i.e., almost pure &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N. In this study, we extend the class of isotopically-purified hBN crystals to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N. Crystals in the four configurations, namely h&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, h&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, h&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, and h&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, were grown by the metal flux method using boron and nitrogen single isotope (&amp;gt;99%) enriched sources, with nickel plus chromium as the solvent.

         <title>Aramid Nanodielectrics for Ultraconformal Transparent Electronic Skins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
On&#8208;skin electronics require minimal thicknesses and decent transparency for conformal contact, imperceptible wearing, and visual aesthetics. It is challenging to search for advanced ultrathin dielectrics capable of supporting the active components while maintaining bending softness, easy handling, and wafer&#8208;scale processability. Here, self&#8208;delaminated aramid nanodielectrics (ANDs) are demonstrated, enabling any skin&#8208;like electronics easily exfoliated from the processing substrates after complicated nanofabrication. In addition, ANDs are mechanically strong, chemically and thermally stable, transparent and breathable, therefore are ideal substrates for soft electronics. As demonstrations, compliant epidermal electrodes comprising silver nanowires and ANDs can successfully record high&#8208;quality electromyogram signals with low motion artifacts and satisfying sweat and water resistance. Furthermore, ANDs can serve as both substrates and dielectrics in single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with a merely 160&#8208;nm thickness, which can be operated within 4&#160;V with on/off ratios of 1.4 &#177; 0.5 &#215; 105, mobilities of 39.9 &#177; 2.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, and negligible hysteresis. The ultraconformal FETs can function properly when wrapped around human hair without any degradation in performance.

         <title>Bionic Micro&#8208;Texture Duplication and RE3+ Space&#8208;Selective Doping of Unclonable Silica Nanocomposites for Multilevel Encryption and Intelligent Authentication</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;capacity optical data storage and information encryption by using glass substrates are fascinating due to merits of expanding the functionality and applicability of the optoelectronic field. However, the development of glass substrate based multi&#8208;dimentional information encryption methods has remained a challenge because of the high hardness, brittleness and melting temperature of glasses. Herein, inspired by the unique natural structure of plant leaves, multicolor micro&#8208;texture&#8208;based physical unclonable functions (PUFs) fluorescence glass labels (MTPLs) were exploited by using ultraviolet photocurable silica nanocomposites and soft replication method. It is the first time that simultaneous rare&#8208;earth ion (RE3+) space&#8208;selective doping and bionic micro&#8208;texture replication onto transparent glass have been realized, in which the doping position and fluorescence color of RE3+ and height information of unclonable micro&#8208;texture can be selectively equipped for multilevel information encryption. The prepared micro&#8208;scale MTPLs are endowed with tunable multilevel authentication models, including macro&#8208;scale multicolor fluorescent two&#8208;dimensional patterns, micro&#8208;scale pattern, color three&#8208;dimensional information and intelligence authentication. A high&#8208;performance anti&#8208;counterfeiting platform with interactive authentication is also established based on the high robustness and security of MTPLs. Such unclonable bionic MTPLs based on RE3+ space&#8208;selective doping and micro&#8208;texture duplication provide an effective and potentially universal approach for multilevel encryption and intelligent authentication.

         <title>Investigating the Superior Performance of Hard Carbon Anodes in Sodium&#8208;Ion Compared With Lithium&#8208; and Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hard carbons are fabricated via hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures. The hard carbons, as anodes, exhibit differing ion&#8208;storage trends for Li, Na, and K. The best&#8208;performing material G1500 is tested against a Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying excellent energy/power densities and cycling performance.








Abstract
Emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) and potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs) show promise in complementing lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) technology and diversifying the battery market. Hard carbon is a potential anode candidate for LIBs, NIBs, and KIBs due to its high capacity, sustainability, wide availability, and stable physicochemical properties. Herein, a series of hard carbons is synthesized by hydrothermal carbonization and subsequent pyrolysis at different temperatures to finely tune their structural properties. When tested as anodes, the hard carbons exhibit differing ion&#8208;storage trends for Li, Na, and K, with NIBs achieving the highest reversible capacity. Extensive materials and electrochemical characterizations are carried out to study the correlation of structural features with electrochemical performance and to explain the specific mechanisms of alkali&#8208;ion storage in hard carbons. In addition, the best&#8208;performing hard carbon is tested against a sodium cathode Na3V2(PO4)3 in a Na&#8208;ion pouch cell, displaying a high power density of 2172&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at an energy density of 181.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total weight of active materials in both anode and cathode). The Na&#8208;ion pouch cell also shows stable ultralong&#8208;term cycling (9000 h or 5142 cycles) and demonstrates the promising potential of such materials as sustainable, scalable anodes for beyond Li&#8208;batteries.

         <title>Bioinspired Integrated Auxetic Elastomers Constructed by a Dual Dynamic Interfacial Healing Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) with a skeleton&#8208;matrix structure is elaborated through dual dynamic interfacial healing driven by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. The IAE remedied the decline in mechanical performance caused by subtractive manufacturing while retaining its auxetic property in a large deformation, which paves a way for automatic scaled&#8208;up synthesis of modular heterogeneous metamaterials.








Abstract
Auxetic materials are appealing due to their unique characteristics of transverse expansion while being axially stretched. Nevertheless, current auxetic materials are often produced by the introduction of diverse geometric structures through cutting or other pore&#8208;making processes, which heavily weaken their mechanical performance. Inspired by the skeleton&#8208;matrix structures in natural organisms, this study reports an integrated auxetic elastomer (IAE) composed of high&#8208;modulus cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a skeleton and low&#8208;modulus non&#8208;cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) as a complementary&#8208;shape matrix. Benefiting from disulfide bonds and hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;promoted dual dynamic interfacial healing, the resulting IAE is flat, void&#8208;free, and has no sharp soft&#8208;to&#8208;hard interface. Its fracture strength and elongation at the break are increased to 400% and 150%, respectively, of the values of corrugated re&#8208;entrant skeleton alone, while the negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) reserves within a strain range of 0%&#8211;104%. In addition, the advantageous mechanical and auxetic properties of this elastomer are further confirmed by finite element analysis. The concept of combining two dissimilar polymers into an integrated hybrid material solves the problem of the deterioration in mechanical performance of auxetic materials after subtractive manufacturing, while preserves the NPR effect in a large deformation, which provides a promising approach to robust auxetic materials for engineering applications.

         <title>Chiroptical Response Inversion and Enhancement of Room&#8208;Temperature Exciton&#8208;Polaritons Using 2D Chirality in Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8211;matter interaction between a 2D chiroptical film and a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity is investigated. The chiroptical response inversion of the 2D chiroptical film shall be ideally suited to the circularly polarized light switching feature in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity, resulting in the enhancement effect in the chiroptical signal.








Abstract
Although chiral semiconductors have shown promising progress in direct circularly polarized light (CPL) detection and emission, they still face potential challenges. A chirality&#8208;switching mechanism or approach integrating two enantiomers is needed to discriminate the handedness of a given CPL; additionally, a large material volume is required for sufficient chiroptical interaction. These two requirements pose significant obstacles to the simplification and miniaturization of the devices. Here, room&#8208;temperature chiral polaritons fulfilling dual&#8208;handedness functions and exhibiting a more&#8208;than&#8208;two&#8208;order enhancement of the chiroptical signal are demonstrated, by embedding a 40 nm&#8208;thick perovskite film with a 2D&#160;chiroptical effect into a Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot cavity. By mixing chiral perovskites with different crystal structures, a pronounced 2D&#160;chiroptical effect is accomplished in the perovskite film, featured by an inverted chiroptical response for counter&#8208;propagating CPL. This inversion behavior matches the photonic handedness switch during CPL circulation in the Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot&#160;cavity, thus harvesting giant enhancement of the chiroptical response. Furthermore, affected by the unique quarter&#8208;wave&#8208;plate effects, the polariton emission achieves a chiral dissymmetry of &#177;4% (for the emission from the front and the back sides). The room&#8208;temperature polaritons with the strong dissymmetric chiroptical interaction shall have implications on a fundamental level and future on&#8208;chip applications for biomolecule analysis and quantum computing.

         <title>A General Strategy for Developing Ultrasensitive &#8220;Transistor&#8208;Like&#8221; Thermochromic Fluorescent Materials for Multilevel Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular&#8208;engineering strategy based on rational design and selection of fluorophores and phase&#8208;change molecules to construct color&#8208;independent thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) with ultrasensitive thermoresponsive fluorescence switching, high brightness, and superior reversibility and stability to the heating&#8211;cooling cycle is reported. By using these TFMs, a thermo&#8208;controllable multilevel information encryption/decryption is achieved within 10&#160;K temperature change.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) exhibit great potential in information encryption applications but are limited by low thermosensitivity, poor color tunability, and a wide temperature&#8208;responsive range. Herein, a novel strategy for constructing highly sensitive TFMs with tunable emission (450&#8211;650&#160;nm) toward multilevel information encryption is proposed, which employs polarity&#8208;sensitive fluorophores with donor&#8211;acceptor&#8211;donor (D&#8211;A&#8211;D) type structures as emitters and long&#8208;chain alkanes as thermosensitive loading matrixes. The structure&#8211;function relationships between the performance of TFMs and the structures of both fluorescent emitters and phase&#8208;change molecules are systematically studied. Benefiting from the above design, the obtained TFMs exhibit over 9500&#8208;fold fluorescence enhancement toward the temperature change, as well as ultrahigh relative temperature sensitivity up to 80%&#160;K&#8722;1, which are first confirmed. Thanks to the superior transducing performance, the above&#8208;prepared TFMs can be further developed as information&#8208;storage platforms within a relatively narrow interval of temperature variation, including temperature&#8208;dominated multicolored information display and multilevel information encryption. This work will not only provide a novel perspective for designing superior TFMs for information encryption but also bring inspiration to the design and preparation of other response&#8208;switching&#8208;type fluorescent probes with ultrahigh conversion efficiency.

         <title>Polyhedron&#8208;Like Biomaterials for Innervated and Vascularized Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by space&#8208;filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via Digital Light Processing (DLP)&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. The polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds exhibit satisfactory effects on stimulating osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and neurogenesis in vitro, and achieving good innervated and vascularized bone regeneration in vivo.








Abstract
Neural&#8208;vascular networks are densely distributed through periosteum, cortical bone, and cancellous bone, which is of great significance for bone regeneration and remodeling. Although significant progress has been made in bone tissue engineering, ineffective bone regeneration, and delayed osteointegration still remains an issue due to the ignorance of intrabony nerves and blood vessels. Herein, inspired by space&#8208;filling polyhedra with open architectures, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds with spatial topologies are prepared via 3D&#8208;printing technology to mimic the meshwork structure of cancellous bone. Benefiting from its spatial topologies, polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds greatly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) via activating PI3K&#8208;Akt signals, and exhibiting satisfactory performance on angiogenesis and neurogenesis. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation elucidates that polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds have a relatively lower area&#8208;weighted average static pressure, which is beneficial to osteogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments further demonstrate that polyhedron&#8208;like scaffolds obviously promote bone formation and osteointegration, as well as inducing vascularization and ingrowth of nerves, leading to innervated and vascularized bone regeneration. Taken together, this work offers a promising approach for fabricating multifunctional scaffolds without additional exogenous seeding cells and growth factors, which holds great potential for functional tissue regeneration and further clinical translation.

         <title>Highly Stable and Efficient Formamidinium&#8208;Based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells via Lattice Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicate selection of spacer cations and polarity&#8208;matched molecular additives is presented to manipulate the 2D perovskite lattice, improving related texture and stability. The optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 20.03% (certified efficiency of 19.30%). Furthermore, the devices exhibit less than 1% efficiency degradation after operation at maximum power point for 1000 h.








Abstract
Formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based 2D perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates in solar cells. However, the insertion of 2D spacer cations into the perovskite lattice concomitantly introduces microstrain and unfavorable orientations that hinder efficiency and stability. In this study, by finely tuning the FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite lattice through spacer cation engineering, a stable lattice structure with balanced distortion, microstrain relaxation, and reduced carrier&#8211;lattice interactions is achieved. These advancements effectively stabilize the inherently soft lattice against light and thermal&#8208;aging stress. To reduce the photocurrent loss induced by undesired crystal texture, a polarity&#8208;matched molecular&#8208;type selenourea (SENA) additive is further employed to modulate the crystallization kinetics. The introduction of the SENA significantly inhibits the disordered crystallization induced by spacer cations and drives the templated growth of the quantum well structure with a vertical orientation. This controlled crystallization process effectively reduces crystal defects and enhances charge separation. Ultimately, the optimized FA&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaic devices achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% (certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.30%), setting a new record for low&#8208;n 2D perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the devices exhibit less than 1% efficiency degradation after operating at maximum power point for 1000 h and maintain excellent stability after thermal aging and cycles of cold&#8211;warm shock, respectively.

         <title>Engineering Efficient CAR&#8208;T Cells via Electroactive Nanoinjection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform consisting of arrays of vertically configured conductive nanotubes, which mediate the loading and efficient nanoinjection of CAR construct into primary human T cells, with negligible cellular damage, is developed. The engineered ENI platform provides a non&#8208;viral, low&#8208;voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti&#8208;lymphoma CAR&#8208;T cells.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#8208;T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell&#8208;based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR&#8208;T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches.

&lt;p&gt;An electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform consisting of arrays of vertically configured conductive nanotubes, which mediate the loading and efficient nanoinjection of CAR construct into primary human T cells, with negligible cellular damage, is developed. The engineered ENI platform provides a non-viral, low-voltage (10&#160;V), scalable, and reusable intracellular delivery system that can generate functional and effective anti-lymphoma CAR-T cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has emerged as a promising cell-based immunotherapy approach for treating blood disorders and cancers, but genetically engineering CAR-T cells is challenging due to primary T cells&#8217; sensitivity to conventional gene delivery approaches. The current viral-based method can typically involve significant operating costs and biosafety hurdles, while bulk electroporation (BEP) can lead to poor cell viability and functionality. Here, a non-viral electroactive nanoinjection (ENI) platform is developed to efficiently negotiate the plasma membrane of primary human T cells via vertically configured electroactive nanotubes, enabling efficient delivery (68.7%) and expression (43.3%) of CAR genes in the T cells, with minimal cellular perturbation (&amp;gt;90% cell viability). Compared to conventional BEP, the ENI platform achieves an almost threefold higher CAR transfection efficiency, indicated by the significantly higher reporter GFP expression (43.3% compared to 16.3%). By co-culturing with target lymphoma Raji cells, the ENI-transfected CAR-T cells&#8217; ability to effectively suppress lymphoma cell growth (86.9% cytotoxicity) is proved. Taken together, the results demonstrate the platform's remarkable capacity to generate functional and effective anti-lymphoma CAR-T cells.

         <title>Unleashing The Full Potential of Photo&#8208;Driven Co Hydrogenation to Light Olefins Over Carbon&#8208;Coated CoMn&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>

Abstract
As a nonpetroleum process, photo&#8208;driven Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis provides a practical approach for the synthesis of light olefins. However, maximizing the solar energy conversion efficiency based on the design of composite catalyst and understanding catalytic mechanism remain challenging. Herein, a novel carbon&#8208;coated CoMn&#8208;based catalysts, C&#8208;coated mixture of Co and MnO, is designed for the efficient conversion of syngas to light olefins under light irradiation. The CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst exhibited a CO conversion of 12.6% with a selectivity to light olefins of 36.5% under light irradiation, showing 5.5&#8208;fold the activity of thermocatalysis. Experimental characterizations ascertain CoMnC&#8208;450 catalyst can be excited to generate photogenerated carriers under light irradiation and then the electron transfer to metallic Co to form electron&#8208;rich active sites with carbon mediation, thereby enhancing the catalytic performance. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculation based on density functional theory reveal the unique roles of photogenerated carriers in promoting the adsorption and activation of CO molecule. This study demonstrates a feasible catalyst model to efficiently utilize full&#8208;spectral solar light to produce the value&#8208;added chemical.

         <title>Design Principles of Single Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction: From Targeted Structures to Active Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hydrogen production from electrolytic water is considered a viable method for hydrogen production with significant social value due to its clean and pollution&#8208;free nature, high hydrogen production efficiency and purity, but the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process is complex and kinetically slow. Single atom catalysts (SACs) with 100% atom utilization and homogeneous active sites often exhibit high catalytic activity and are expected to be extensively applied. The catalytic performance of OER can be further improved by precise regulation of the structure through electronic effects, coordination environment, hybrid atom doping and so on. In this review, we introduce the mechanisms of OER under different conditions, systematically summarize the latest research progress of SACs in the field of OER, then discuss the effects of various structural regulation strategies on catalytic performance, and propose principles and ideas for the design of SACs for OER. In the end, we summarize the outstanding issues and current challenges in this field.

         <title>Instant Protection Spray for Anti&#8208;Infection And Accelerated Healing of Empyrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Distinct from common injuries, deep burns often require a chronic recovery cycle for healing and long&#8208;term antibiotic treatment to prevent infection. The presence of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria has caused antibiotics to no longer be perfect, and continuous drug use can easily lead to repeated infection and even death. Inspired by how wild animals chew plants to prevent wound infection, probiotic extracts with a structure similar to the tailspike of phage were obtained from L. casei and combined with different flavones to design a series of nonantibiotic bactericides. These novel antibacterial agents were combined with a rapid gelation spray with a novel cross&#8208;angle layout to form an instant protection spray (IPS) and provide a physical and anti&#8208;infectious barrier for burns within 30 s. This IPS was able to sterilize 100.00% and 96.14% of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro and in vivo, respectively. In addition, it was found to effectively reduce inflammation in MRSA&#8208;infected burns in rats and promote tissue healing.

         <title>Scalable Electrodeposition of Liquid Metal from An Acetonitrile&#8208;Based Electrolyte for Highly&#8208;Integrated Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The advancement of highly&#8208;integrated stretchable electronics requires the development of scalable (sub)&#8208;micrometer conductor patterning. Eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) is an attractive conductor for stretchable electronics, as its liquid metallic character grants it high electrical conductivity upon deformation. However, its high surface energy makes its patterning with sub&#8208;micron resolution challenging. Herein, we overcome this limitation by reporting for the first time the electrodeposition of EGaIn. We use a non&#8208;aqueous acetonitrile&#8208;based electrolyte that exhibits high electrochemical stability and chemical orthogonality. The electrodeposited material led to low&#8208;resistance lines that remained stable upon (repeated) stretching to a 100% strain. Because electrodeposition benefits from the resolution of mature nanofabrication methods used to pattern the base metal, the proposed &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; approach achieved a record&#8208;high density integration of EGaIn regular lines of 300&#160;nm half&#8208;pitch on an elastomer substrate by plating on a gold seed layer pre&#8208;patterned by nanoimprinting. Moreover, vertical integration was enabled by filling high aspect ratio vias. This capability was conceptualized by the fabrication of an omnidirectionally stretchable 3D electronic circuit, and demonstrates a soft&#8208;electronic analogue of the stablished damascene process used to fabricate microchip interconnects. Overall, this work proposes a simple route to address the challenge of metallization in highly&#8208;integrated (3D) stretchable electronics.

Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) exhibit complex charge dynamics, which are closely correlated with the dielectric constant (&#949;r) of photovoltaic materials. Here we design and synthesize a series of novel conjugated copolymers based on benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8217;]difuran (BDF) and benzotriazole (BTz), which differ by the nature of &#960;&#8208;bridge from one another. The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz with asymmetric furan and thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge demonstrates a larger &#949;r of 4.22 than PBDF&#8208;dT&#8208;BTz with symmetric thiophene &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.15) and PBDF&#8208;dF&#8208;BTz with symmetric furan &#960;&#8208;bridge (3.90). The PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz also offers more favorable molecular packing and appropriate miscibility with non&#8208;fullerene acceptor Y6 than its counterparts. The corresponding PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6 OSCs display efficient exciton dissociation, fast charge transport and collection, and reduced charge recombination, eventually leading to a power conversion efficiency of 17.01%. When introducing a fullerene derivative (PCBO&#8208;12) as a third component, the PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz:Y6:PCBO&#8208;12 OSCs yield a remarkable FF of 80.11% with a high efficiency of 18.10%, the highest value among all reported BDF polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Our work provides an effective approach to developing high&#8208;permittivity photovoltaic materials, showcasing PBDF&#8208;TF&#8208;BTz as a promising polymer donor for constructing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

         <title>Magnetic Imaging and Domain Nucleation in CrSBr Down to the 2D Limit.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent advancements in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have revealed the potential of van der Waals magnets, and specifically of their magnetic anisotropy that allows applications down to the two&#8208;dimensional limit. Among these materials, CrSBr has emerged as a promising candidate, because its intriguing magnetic and electronic properties have appeal for both fundamental and applied research in spintronics or magnonics. Here, we use nano SQUID&#8208;on&#8208;tip (SOT) microscopy to obtain direct magnetic imaging of CrSBr flakes with thicknesses ranging from monolayer (N = 1) to few&#8208;layer (N = 5). The ferromagnetic order is preserved down to the monolayer, while the antiferromagnetic coupling of the layers starts from the bilayer case. For odd layers, at zero applied magnetic field, we directly image the stray field resulting from the uncompensated layer. We also measure the progressive spin reorientation along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction (hard axis) with a finite applied magnetic field, allowing us to evaluate the anisotropy constant, which remains stable down to the monolayer and is close to the bulk value. Finally, by controlling the size of the applied magnetic field, we can observe the formation of N&#233;el magnetic domain walls down to the single layer limit.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2MnN8 Triatomic Sites Anchored in N&#8208;Doped Carbon Enabling Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the redistribution of d electrons for the spontaneous adsorption of *OH and the optimized binding energy of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) intermediates, an as&#8208;constructed novel trinuclear structure with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single Mn atom adjacent to two Co atoms anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon (Co2MnN8/C) exhibits an exceptional ORR activity with a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal&#8211;nitrogen/carbon (M&#8211;N/C) catalysts have emerged as the most promising substitutes to the precious platinum counterparts toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the reported M&#8211;N/C catalysts are usually in the form of common M&#8211;N4 moieties with only a single metal active site, and they suffer from insufficient activity. Herein, an unusual trinuclear active structure is elaborately developed with a nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single Mn atom adjacent to two Co atoms (Co2MnN8) anchored in N&#8208;doped carbon as a highly efficient ORR catalyst via adsorption&#8211;pyrolysis of a bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework precursor. Atomic structural investigations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Co2MnN8 would experience a spontaneous OH binding to form Co2MnN8&#8208;2OH as the real active site, leading to a single electron&#8208;filled state in the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital and an optimized binding energy of intermediates. Accordingly, the as&#8208;developed Co2MnN8/C exhibits an unprecedented ORR activity with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.912&#160;V and outstanding stability, not only surpassing the Pt/C catalyst but also representing a new record for the Co&#8208;based catalyst.

         <title>Electrochemically Responsive 3d Nanoarchitectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Responsive nanomaterials are being developed to create new unique functionalities such as switchable colours and adhesive properties or other programmable features in response to external stimuli. While many existing examples rely on changes in temperature, humidity, or pH, we aim to explore an alternative approach relying on simple electric input signals. More specifically, we develop three&#8208;dimensional (3D) electrochromic architected microstructures using carbon nanotube (CNT) &#8211; Tin (Sn) composites that can be reconfigured by lithiating Sn with low power electric input (&#8776; 50 nanowatts). These microstructures have a continuous, regulated, and non&#8208;volatile actuation determined by the extent of the electrochemical lithiation process. In addition, our proposed fabrication process relies only on batch lithographic techniques, enabling the parallel production of thousands of 3D microstructures. We demonstrate structures with a 30%&#8208;97% change in open&#8208;end area upon actuation and highlight the importance of geometric factors in the response and structural integrity of 3D architected microstructures during electrochemical actuation.

         <title>Exciton&#8208;Scissoring Perfluoroarenes Trigger Photomultiplication in Full Color Organic Image Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent networks consisting of photo&#8208;crosslinked polymer donor:perfluoroarene exhibit exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, leading to high EQE photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes together with enhanced stability and fine photo&#8208;patternability, without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. This mechanism is enabled by interfacial energy band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor, as confirmed by photophysical analyses.








Abstract
An unprecedented but useful functionality of perfluoroarenes to enable exciton scissoring in photomultiplication&#8208;type organic photodiodes (PM&#8208;OPDs) is reported. Perfluoroarenes that are covalently connected to polymer donors via a photochemical reaction enable the demonstration of high external quantum efficiency and B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPDs without the use of conventional acceptor molecules. The operation mechanism of the suggested perfluoroarene&#8208;driven PM&#8208;OPDs, how covalently bonded polymer donor:perfluoroarene PM&#8208;OPDs can perform as effectively as polymer donor:fullerene blend&#8208;based PM&#8208;OPDs, is investigated. By employing a series of arenes and conducting steady&#8208;state/time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence and transient absorption spectroscopy analyses, it is found that interfacial band bending between the perfluoroaryl group and polymer donor is responsible for exciton scissoring and subsequent electron trapping, which induces photomultiplication. Owing to the acceptor&#8208;free and covalently interconnected photoactive layer in the suggested PM&#8208;OPDs, superior operational and thermal stabilities are observed. Finally, finely patterned B&#8208;/G&#8208;/R&#8208;selective PM&#8208;OPD arrays that enable the construction of highly sensitive passive matrix&#8208;type organic image sensors are demonstrated.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Color Real&#8208;Time Chemosensing of A Compartmentalized Reaction Network Involving Enzyme&#8208;Induced Membrane Permeation of Peptides</title>

Abstract
The design of synthetic systems with interrelated reaction sequences that model incipient biological complexity is limited by physicochemical tools that allow the direct monitoring of the individual processes in real time. To mimic a simple digestion&#8208;resorption sequence, we have designed compartmentalized liposomal systems that incorporate extra&#8208; and intravesicular chemosensing ensembles. The extravesicular reporter pair consisted of cucurbit[7]uril and methylene blue to monitor the enzymatic cleavage of short enkephalin&#8208;related peptides by thermolysin through a switch&#8208;off fluorescence response (&#8220;digestion&#8221;). Because the substrate is membrane&#8208;impermeable, but the dipeptide product permeable, an uptake of the latter into the pre&#8208;formed liposomes occurred as follow&#8208;up process. The intravesicular chemosensing ensemble consisted of (i) cucurbit[8]uril, 2&#8208;anilinonaphthalene&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid, and methyl viologen or (ii) cucurbit[7]uril and berberine to monitor the uptake (&#8220;resorption&#8221;) of the enzymatic products through the liposomal membranes by (i) a switch&#8208;on or (ii) a switch&#8208;off fluorescence response. The dyes were designed to allow selective optical excitation and read&#8208;out of the extra&#8208; and intravesicular dyes, which allowed for a dual&#8208;color chemosensing and, therefore, a kinetic discrimination of the two sequential reactions.

         <title>Biotoxicity of Halide Perovskites in Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites are crystalline semiconductors with exceptional optoelectronic properties, rapidly developing towards large&#8208;scale applications.Lead (II) (Pb2+) is the core element used to prepare halide perovskites. Pb2+ can displace key 2+ elements, including calcium, zinc and iron, that regulate vital physiological functions. Sn2+ can replace Pb2+ within the perovskite structure and, if accidentally dispersed in the environment, it readily oxidises to Sn4+, which is incompatible with physiological functions and thus potentially safe. The 3+ salt bismuth (III) (Bi3+) is also potentially safe for the same reason and useful to prepare double perovskites.Here, we study the biotoxicity of Pb, Sn and Bi perovskites in mice for the first time. We analyse histopathology and growth of mice directly exposed to perovskites and investigate the development of their offspring generation. This study provides the screening of organs and key physiological functions targeted by perovskite exposure to design specific studies in mammalians.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ&#8208;Grown Cu Dendrites Plasmonically Enhance Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Facet&#8208;Engineered Cu2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facet&#8208;engineered&#160;Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet&#8208;chemical methods for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).&#160;Operando&#160;Raman spectroscopy and&#160;ex situ&#160;characterization techniques show that Cu2O is reduced during HER.&#160;Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency measurements combined with ab&#160;initio&#160;nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the hot&#8208;electron injection from Cu dendrites to Cu2O facilitates the plasmon&#8208;enhanced electrocatalytic HER activity.








Abstract
Herein, facet&#8208;engineered Cu2O nanostructures are synthesized by wet chemical methods for electrocatalytic HER, and it is found that the octahedral Cu2O nanostructures with exposed crystal planes of (111) (O&#8208;Cu2O) has the best hydrogen evolution performance. Operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques showed that Cu2O is reduced during HER, in which Cu dendrites are grown on the surface of the Cu2O nanostructures, resulting in the better HER performance of O&#8208;Cu2O after HER (O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A) compared with that of the as&#8208;prepared O&#8208;Cu2O. Under illumination, the onset potential of O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A is ca. 52 mV positive than that of O&#8208;Cu2O, which is induced by the plasmon&#8208;activated electrochemical system consisting of Cu2O and the in&#8208;situ generated Cu dendrites. Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) measurements and the simulated UV&#8211;Vis spectrum demonstrate the hot electron injection (HEI) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O. Ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations revealed the transfer of photogenerated electrons (27 fs) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O nanostructures is faster than electron relaxation (170 fs), enhancing its surface plasmons activity, and the HEI of Cu dendrites increases the charge density of Cu2O. These make the energy level of the catalyst be closer to that of H+/H2, evidenced by the plasmon&#8208;enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Lattice Strain Engineering of Ni2P Enables Efficient Catalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile yet robust strategy is developed for strain engineering of Ni2P via double&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. Both experimental and theoretic results reveal that the compressive strain can effectively reduce the reaction energy barrier of HzOR and HER, thereby significantly enhance the performance of hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production.








Abstract
Hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis provides new opportunities to enable energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production while solving the issue of hydrazine pollution. Here, the synthesis of compressively strained Ni2P as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for boosting both the anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is reported. Different from a multistep synthetic method that induces lattice strain by creating core&#8211;shell structures, a facile strategy is developed to tune the strain of&#160;Ni2P via dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping. The obtained Ni2P with a compressive strain of &#8722;3.62% exhibits significantly enhanced activity for both the HzOR and HER than counterparts with tensile strain and without strain. Consequently, the optimized Ni2P delivers current densities of 10 and 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at small cell voltages of 0.16 and 0.39&#160;V for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis, respectively. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the compressive strain promotes water dissociation and concurrently tunes the adsorption strength of hydrogen intermediates, thereby facilitating the HER process on Ni2P. As for the HzOR, the compressive strain reduces the energy barrier of the potential&#8208;determining step for the dehydrogenation of *N2H4 to *N2H3. Clearly, this work paves a facile pathway to the synthesis of lattice&#8208;strained electrocatalysts via the dual&#8208;cation co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Engineering and Characterization of an Artificial Drug&#8208;Carrying Vesicles Nanoplatform for Enhanced Specifically Targeted Therapy of Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are constructed via a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, can carry Doxorubicin (DOX) to penetrate blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and target inflamed brain tumors. It can improve the anticancer efficacy of DOX, significantly reducing side effects. Meanwhile, this work indicates that the nanoplatform may offer great promise for targeted glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) chemotherapy.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment is hindered by complex pathologies and the need to cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) during drug delivery. Although exosomes have great potential for GBM treatment, these alone cannot fully meet the therapeutic requirements, owing to their limitations in targeting and delivery. Herein, engineered artificial vesicles (EAVs), ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs, which are&#160;constructed using a liposome extruder from HEK293T cells expressing ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 peptides, is developed. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1 is a fusion peptide of Angiopep&#8208;2 fused to the N&#8208;terminus of TRP&#8208;PK1, to present Angiopep&#8208;2 on the EAVs. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have similar characteristics to the secreted exosomes, but a much higher yield. ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@EAVs have efficient BBB&#8208;penetration and GBM&#8208;targeting abilities in a mock BBB model in in vitro and orthotopic GBM mouse models in vivo. Doxorubicin loading EAVs (ANG&#8208;TRP&#8208;PK1@DOX) do not alter the characteristics of the EAVs, which can cross the BBB, reach the GBM, and kill tumor cells in orthotopic GBM mouse models. These engineered drug&#8208;loaded artificial vesicles show better therapeutic effects on GBM than temozolomide in mice, with very few side effects. In conclusion, EAVs can be inserted into different targeting ligands and packed into different drugs, and they may serve as unique and efficient nanoplatforms for drug delivery and tumor promise therapy.

         <title>A Nano&#8208;Biohybrid&#8208;Based Bio&#8208;Solar Cell to Regulate the Electrical Signal Transmission to Living Cells for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nano&#8208;biohybrid&#8208;based bio&#8208;solar cell capable of absorbing a broad range of visible wavelengths and generating an amplified photocurrent density is developed to verify the possibility of its biomedical application. The electrophysiological signals of muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction are regulated precisely by motor neurons excited by the photocurrent of the bio&#8208;solar cell upon light irradiation.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;solar cells are studied as sustainable and biocompatible energy sources with significant potential for biomedical applications.

         <title>Titania&#8208;Supported Cu&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Catalyst for Electrochemical Reduction of Acetylene to Ethylene at Low&#8208;Concentrations with Suppressed Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A TiO2&#8208;supported Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst is synthesized for the electrochemical reduction of acetylene at low concentrations. The electrocatalysts promote acetylene activation whilst suppressing hydrogen evolution and ethylene hydrogenation, achieving a 99.8% acetylene conversion with a space velocity of 3.12&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;mL&#160;gCu&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1 in an ethylene&#8208;rich feed gas mixture.








Abstract
Electrochemical acetylene reduction (EAR) is a promising strategy for removing acetylene from ethylene&#8208;rich gas streams. However, suppressing the undesirable hydrogen evolution is vital for practical applications in acetylene&#8208;insufficient conditions. Herein, Cu single atoms are immobilized on anatase TiO2 nanoplates (Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2) for electrochemical acetylene reduction, achieving an ethylene selectivity of &#8776;97% with a 5&#160;vol% acetylene gas feed (Ar balance). At the optimal Cu&#8208;single&#8208;atom loading, Cu&#8208;SA/TiO2 is&#160;able to effectively suppress HER and ethylene over&#8208;hydrogenation even when using dilute acetylene (0.5&#160;vol%) or ethylene&#8208;rich gas feeds, delivering a 99.8% acetylene conversion, providing a turnover frequency of 8.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;s&#8722;1, which is superior to other EAR catalysts reported to date. Theoretical calculations show that the Cu single atoms and the TiO2 support acted cooperatively to promote charge transfer to adsorbed acetylene molecules, whilst also inhibiting hydrogen generation in alkali environments, thus allowing selective ethylene production with negligible hydrogen evolution at low acetylene concentrations.

         <title>An H2O&#8208;Initiated Crosslinking Strategy for Ultrafine&#8208;Nanoclusters&#8208;Reinforced High&#8208;Toughness Polymer&#8208;In&#8208;Plasticizer Solid Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel crosslinking strategy where metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator is proposed. After incorporating a high concentration of plasticizers, the polymer&#8208;in&#8208;plasticizer solid electrolyte still maintains outstanding mechanical properties, thus demonstrating fast lithium&#8208;conduction kinetics and effective inhibition of lithium dendrites simultaneously.








Abstract
Incorporating plasticizers is an effective way to facilitate conduction of ions in solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs). However, this conductivity enhancement often comes at the cost of reduced mechanical properties, which can make the electrolyte membrane more difficult to process and increase safety hazards. Here, a novel crosslinking strategy, wherein metal&#8208;alkoxy&#8208;terminated polymers can be crosslinked by precisely controlling the content of H2O as an initiator, is proposed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, trimethylaluminum (TMA)&#8208;functionalized poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) is used to demonstrate that ultrafine Al&#8211;O nanoclusters can serve as nodes to crosslink PEO chains with a wide range of molecular weights from 10&#160;000 to 8&#160;000&#160;000&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1. The crosslinked polymer network can incorporate a high concentration of plasticizers, with a total weight percentage over 75%, while still maintaining excellent stretchability (4640%) and toughness (3.87&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). The resulting electrolyte demonstrates high ionic conductivity (1.41&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1), low interfacial resistance toward Li metal (48.1&#160;&#937;&#160;cm2), and a wide electrochemical window (&gt;4.8&#160;V vs Li+/Li) at 30&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, the LiFePO4/Li battery shows stable cycle performance with a capacity retention of 98.6% (146.3&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) over 1000 cycles at 1C (1C&#160;=&#160;170&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) at 30&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>A Nanoconfined Water&#8211;Ion Coordination Network for Flexible Energy&#8208;Dissipation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment can significantly promote the interaction between ions and water molecules. Such a strong interaction&#160;facilitates the formation of ion clusters and limits particle dynamics. Based on this mechanism, a liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system capable of providing flexible protection to personnel and devices and instrumentations against mechanical impacts and attacks is designed.








Abstract
Water&#8211;ion interaction in a nanoconfined environment that deeply constrains spatial freedoms of local atomistic motion with unconventional coupling mechanisms beyond that in a free, bulk state is essential to spark designs of a broad spectrum of nanofluidic devices with unique properties and functionalities. Here, it is&#160;reported that the interaction between ions and water molecules in a hydrophobic nanopore forms a coordination network with an interaction density that is nearly fourfold that of the bulk counterpart. Such strong interaction facilitates the connectivity of the water&#8211;ion network and is uncovered by corroborating the formation of ion clusters and the reduction of particle dynamics. A liquid&#8208;nanopore energy&#8208;dissipation system is designed and demonstrated in both molecular simulations and experiments that the formed coordination network controls the outflow of confined electrolytes along with a pressure reduction, capable of providing flexible protection for personnel and devices and instrumentations against external mechanical impact and attack.

         <title>Giant Energy Density via Mechanically Tailored Relaxor Ferroelectric Behavior of PZT Thick Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanograin engineering of normal ferroelectrics beyond compositional modification, to simultaneously enhance the dielectric breakdown strength and polarization with slim hysteresis which is typical behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics (RFE), a facile approach, is designed and revealed for high&#8208;energy&#8208;storage devices. The mechanically transformed RFE thick film (&#8776;4&#160;&#181;m) delivers a record&#8208;high energy density of 124&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy&#8208;storage applications due to their large electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8211;discharging capability. Here, a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition is reported, for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (EDBS) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#181;m thickness exhibit an exceptional EDBS of 540&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&#8722;2), resulting in a record high energy&#8208;storage density of 124.1&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a power density of 64.5&#160;MW&#160;cm&#8722;3. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure&#8208;tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high&#8208;performance energy&#8208;storage materials.

&lt;p&gt;Nanograin engineering of normal ferroelectrics beyond compositional modification, to simultaneously enhance the dielectric breakdown strength and polarization with slim hysteresis which is typical behavior of relaxor ferroelectrics (RFE), a facile approach, is designed and revealed for high-energy-storage devices. The mechanically transformed RFE thick film (&#8776;4&#160;&#181;m) delivers a record-high energy density of 124&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relaxor ferroelectrics (RFEs) are being actively investigated for energy-storage applications due to their large electric-field-induced polarization with slim hysteresis and fast energy charging&#8211;discharging capability. Here, a novel nanograin engineering approach based upon high kinetic energy deposition is reported, for mechanically inducing the RFE behavior in a normal ferroelectric Pb(Zr&lt;sub&gt;0.52&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.48&lt;/sub&gt;)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (PZT), which results in simultaneous enhancement in the dielectric breakdown strength (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DBS&lt;/sub&gt;) and polarization. Mechanically transformed relaxor thick films with 4&#160;&#181;m thickness exhibit an exceptional &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;DBS&lt;/sub&gt; of 540&#160;MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and reduced hysteresis with large unsaturated polarization (103.6&#160;&#181;C&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in a record high energy-storage density of 124.1&#160;J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a power density of 64.5&#160;MW&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;. This fundamental advancement is correlated with the generalized nanostructure design that comprises nanocrystalline phases embedded within the amorphous matrix. Microstructure-tailored ferroelectric behavior overcomes the limitations imposed by traditional compositional design methods and provides a feasible pathway for realization of high-performance energy-storage materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Synthesis of Sodium Chlorides of Unconventional Stoichiometries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis yield of 2D Na2Cl crystals with unconventional stoichiometries in a graphene membrane can be significantly improved by applying a negative potential. Such high content can substantially improve the physical performance of the abnormal Na2Cl crystals. These findings represent a step toward the potential applications of abnormal 2D crystal materials with unique properties.








Abstract
Abnormal salt crystals with unconventional stoichiometries, such as Na2Cl, Na3Cl, K2Cl, and CaCl crystals that have been explored in reduced graphene oxide membranes (rGOMs) or diamond anvil cells, hold great promise in applications due to their unique electronic, magnetic, and optical properties predicted in theory. However, the low content of these crystals, only &lt;1% in rGOM, limits their research interest and utility in applications. Here, a high&#8208;yield synthesis of 2D abnormal crystals with unconventional stoichiometries is reported, which is achieved by applying negative potential on rGOM. A more than tenfold increase in the abnormal Na2Cl crystals is obtained using a potential of &#8722;0.6&#160;V, resulting in an atomic content of 13.4&#160;&#177;&#160;4.7% for Na on rGOM. Direct observations by transmission electron microscopy and piezoresponse force microscopy demonstrates a unique piezoelectric behavior arising from 2D Na2Cl crystals with square structure. The output voltage increases from 0 to &#8776;180&#160;mV in the broad 0&#8211;150&#176; bending angle regime, which meets the voltage requirement of most nanodevices in realistic applications. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the applied negative potential of the graphene surface can strengthen the effect of the Na+&#8211;&#960; interaction and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between cations, making more Na2Cl crystals formed.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Modulation on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual defect engineering strategy is developed to simultaneously create tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects. These defects in a Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) are created to modulate the spin state of Ni active sites and further optimize the adsorption energy of OH* and OOH* intermediates for accelerating OER kinetics, ensuring fast OER kinetics and enhanced OER activity.








Abstract
Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are heavily correlated with hybridization of the transition metal d&#8208;orbital and oxygen intermediate p&#8208;orbital, which dictates the barriers of intermediate adsorption/desorption on the active sites of catalysts. Herein, a strategy is developed involving strain engineering and coordination regulation to enhance the hybridization of Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals, and the as&#8208;synthesized Ni&#8208;2,6&#8208;naphthalenedicarboxylic acid metal&#8211;organic framework (DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA) nanosheets deliver a low OER overpotential of 260&#160;mV to reach 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. By integrating an alkaline anion exchange membrane electrolyzer and Pt/C electrode, 200 and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 current densities are reached with cell voltages of 1.6 and 2.1&#160;V, respectively. When loaded on a BiVO4 photoanode, the nanosheet enables highly active solar&#8208;driven water oxygen. Structural characterizations together with theoretical calculations reveal that the spin state of the centre Ni atoms is regulated by the tensile strain and unsaturated coordination defects in DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA, and such spin regulation facilitates spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer of the OER. Molecular orbital hybridization analysis reveals the mechanism of OH* and OOH* adsorption energy regulation by changes in the DD&#8208;Ni&#8208;NDA spin state, which provides a deeper understanding of the electronic structure design of catalysts for the OER.

         <title>Versatile Synthesis of Hollow&#8208;Structured Mesoporous Carbons by Enhanced Surface Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons with ultrahigh surface area, large pore volume and heteroatom doping are synthesized by a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method. The materials display remarkable electrochemical performance for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The studies reveal that strong interactions between the organic molecules and the silanol&#8208;rich surface of the silica template are crucial.








Abstract
Nanoporous carbons are very attractive for various applications including energy storage. Templating methods with assembled amphiphilic molecules or porous inorganic templates are typically used for the synthesis. Amongst the different members of this family, CMK&#8208;5&#8208;like structures that are constructed to consist of sub&#8208;10&#160;nm amorphous carbon nanotubes and ultrahigh specific surface area due to their thin pore walls, have the best properties in various respects. However, the fabrication of such hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons entails elaborately tailoring the surface properties of the template pore walls and selecting specific carbon precursors. Thus, very limited cases are successful. Herein, a versatile and general silanol&#8208;assisted surface&#8208;casting method to create hollow&#8208;structured mesoporous carbons and heteroatom&#8208;doped derivatives with numerous organic molecules (e.g., furfuryl alcohol, resol, 2&#8208;thiophene methanol, dopamine, tyrosine) and different structural templates is reported. These carbon materials exhibit ultrahigh surface area (2400&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1), large pore volume (4.0&#160;cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), as well as satisfactory lithium&#8208;storage capacity (1460&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (320&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and very outstanding cycling performance (2000 cycles at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1).

         <title>Intermittent Defect Fluctuations in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermittent, equilibrium dynamics of brownmillerite/perovskite domains in an epitaxial SrCoOx on LSAT substrate are revealed using in situ Bragg X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy. The dynamics appear to be thermally activated and can be tuned via epitaxial strain, consistent with results from density functional theory and phase field simulations.








Abstract
The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and their influence on the functionality of a material. Here, the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X&#8208;ray photon correlation spectroscopy is reported. Local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoOx with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies are observed. Ab&#8208;initio&#8208;informed phase&#8208;field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion/vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent X&#8208;rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. The study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.

Local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt; with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies are observed. Ab-initio-informed phase-field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion/vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent X-rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. The study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Computational Modeling of Implantable, Bioresorbable Drug Release Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mathematical treatment of polymer solidification, degradation, and diffusivity accurately predicts drug release profiles from a range of size and molecular weight. This mechanistic model offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on polymer degradation and drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for tailored release systems.








Abstract
Implantable, bioresorbable drug delivery systems offer an alternative to current drug administration techniques; allowing for patient&#8208;tailored drug dosage, while also increasing patient compliance. Mechanistic mathematical modeling allows for the acceleration of the design of the release systems, and for prediction of physical anomalies that are not intuitive and may otherwise elude discovery. This study investigates short&#8208;term drug release as a function of water&#8208;mediated polymer phase inversion into a solid depot within hours to days, as well as long&#8208;term hydrolysis&#8208;mediated degradation and erosion of the implant over the next few weeks. Finite difference methods are used to model spatial and temporal changes in polymer phase inversion, solidification, and hydrolysis. Modeling reveals the impact of non&#8208;uniform drug distribution, production and transport of H+ ions, and localized polymer degradation on the diffusion of water, drug, and hydrolyzed polymer byproducts. Compared to experimental data, the computational model accurately predicts the drug release during the solidification of implants over days and drug release profiles over weeks from microspheres and implants. This work offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for release systems to meet a patient specific clinical need.

         <title>Continuous&#8208;Spectrum&#8211;Polarization Recombinant Optical Encryption with a Dielectric Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous&#8208;spectrum&#8211;polarization recombinant optical encryption with all&#8208;silicon metasurface is reported. The arbitrary and continuous combination of polarization and wavelength channels enables the dramatic increase of information capacity to 210 or more. The high transmittance and large operation bandwidth in mid&#8208;infrared further promise the high&#8208;capability encryption communication application in this indispensable atmosphere window.








Abstract
The Jones matrix, with eight degrees of freedom (DoFs), provides a general mathematical framework for the multifunctional design of metasurfaces. Theoretically, the maximum eight DoFs can be further extended in the spectrum dimension to endow unique encryption capabilities. However, the topology and intrinsic spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms constrains the continuous engineering of polarization evolution over wavelength dimension. In this work, a forward evolution strategy to quickly establish the mapping relationships between the solutions of the dispersion Jones matrix and the spectral responses of meta&#8208;atoms is reported. Based on the eigenvector transformation method, arbitrary conjugate polarization channels over the continuous&#8208;spectrum dimension are successfully reconstructed. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a silicon metadevice is demonstrated for optical information encryption transmission. Remarkably, the arbitrary combination forms of polarization and wavelength dimension increase the information capacity (210), and the measured polarization contrasts of the conjugate polarization conversion are &gt;94% in the entire wavelength range (3&#8211;4&#160;&#181;m). It is believed that the proposed approach will benefit secure optical and quantum information technologies.

         <title>Spotlight on Luminescence Thermometry: Basics, Challenges, and Cutting&#8208;Edge Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest emerging trends of luminescence (nano)thermometry are reviewed from a perspective that has not been considered so far. The theoretical framework covering ratiometric and lifetime&#8208;based luminescent thermometers, recommendable standardization practices, reliability, and reproducibility, as well as the advancing use of algorithms for thermal readout improvement are discussed. These backgrounds are complemented by cutting&#8208;edge applications, current challenges, and future directions.








Abstract
Luminescence (nano)thermometry is a remote sensing technique that relies on the temperature dependency of the luminescence features (e.g., bandshape, peak energy or intensity, and excited state lifetimes and risetimes) of a phosphor to measure temperature. This technique provides precise thermal readouts with superior spatial resolution in short acquisition times. Although luminescence thermometry is just starting to become a more mature subject, it exhibits enormous potential in several areas, e.g., optoelectronics, photonics, micro&#8208; and nanofluidics, and nanomedicine. This work reviews the latest trends in the field, including the establishment of a comprehensive theoretical background and standardized practices. The reliability, repeatability, and reproducibility of the technique are also discussed, along with the use of multiparametric analysis and artificial&#8208;intelligence algorithms to enhance thermal readouts. In addition, examples are provided to underscore the challenges that luminescence thermometry faces, alongside the need for a continuous search and design of new materials, experimental techniques, and analysis procedures to improve the competitiveness, accessibility, and popularity of the technology

         <title>Narrowband Organic Afterglow via Phosphorescence F&#246;rster Resonance Energy Transfer for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrowband organic afterglow materials are achieved via a phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer process by the combination of the long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donor and narrowband emission feature of the fluorescence acceptor. The resulting materials exhibit high color purity and multicolor narrowband afterglow, demonstrating potential in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and instant information identification.








Abstract
Achieving multicolor organic afterglow materials with narrowband emission and high color purity is important in various optoelectronic fields but remains a great challenge. Here, an efficient strategy is presented to obtain narrowband organic afterglow materials via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from long&#8208;lived phosphorescence donors to narrowband fluorescence acceptors in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. The resulting materials exhibit narrowband emission with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) as small as 23&#160;nm and the longest lifetime of 721.22&#160;ms. Meanwhile, by pairing the appropriate donors and acceptors, multicolor and high color purity afterglow ranging from green to red with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 67.1% are achieved. Moreover, given their long luminescence lifetime, high color purity, and flexibility, the potential applications are demonstrated in high&#8208;resolution afterglow displays and dynamic and quick information identification in low&#8208;light conditions. This work provides a facile approach for developing multicolor and narrowband afterglow materials as well as expands the features of organic afterglow.

         <title>Achieving Superior Tensile Performance in Individual Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>

The single&#8208;crystal tetraphenylporphyrin&#8208;type metal&#8208;organic framework nanobelts are found to exhibit unprecedented mechanical properties beyond theoretical limits and the origins of these mechanical properties are revealed by simulations.








Abstract
Rapid advances in the engineering application prospects of metal&#8722;organic framework (MOF) materials necessitate an urgent in&#8208;depth understanding of their mechanical properties. This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni&#8208;TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength&#8208;to&#8208;Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first&#8208;principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.

This work demonstrates unprecedented recoverable elastic deformation of Ni-tetraphenylporphyrins (Ni-TCPP) MOF nanobelts with a tensile strain as high as 14%, and a projected yield strength-to-Young's modulus ratio exceeding the theoretical limit (&#8776;10%) for crystalline materials. Based on first-principles simulations, the observed behavior of MOF crystal can be attributed to the mechanical deformation induced conformation transition and the formation of helical configuration of dislocations under high stresses, arising from their organic ligand building blocks in the crystal structures. The investigations of the mechanical properties along with electromechanical properties demonstrate that MOF materials have exciting application potential for biomechanics integrated systems, flexible electronics, and nanoelectromechanical devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reduced Graphene Oxide Electrolyte&#8208;Gated Transistor Immunosensor with Highly Selective Multiparametric Detection of Anti&#8208;Drug Antibodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor immunosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (rGO&#8208;EGT) for the detection of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ATIs) against the drug Infliximab is reported. The multiparametric analysis of the immunosensor response, with a theoretical limit of detection of 10 am, allows for the discrimination between ATIs and interfering agents.








Abstract
The advent of immunotherapies with biological drugs has revolutionized the treatment of cancers and auto&#8208;immune diseases. However, in some patients, the production of anti&#8208;drug antibodies (ADAs) hampers the drug efficacy. The concentration of ADAs is typically in the range of 1&#8211;10 pm; hence their immunodetection is challenging. ADAs toward Infliximab (IFX), a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other auto&#8208;immune diseases, are focussed. An ambipolar electrolyte&#8208;gated transistor (EGT) immunosensor is reported based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) channel and IFX bound to the gate electrode as the specific probe. The rGO&#8208;EGTs are easy to fabricate and exhibit low voltage operations (&#8804; 0.3&#160;V), a robust response within 15&#160;min, and ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (10 am limit of detection). A multiparametric analysis of the whole rGO&#8208;EGT transfer curves based on the type&#8208;I generalized extreme value distribution is proposed. It is demonstrated that it allows to selectively quantify ADAs also in the co&#8208;presence of its antagonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;), the natural circulating target of IFX.

         <title>Diatomite&#8208;Templated Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Cobalt&#8208;Doped MoS2/Carbon Composites to Boost Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy to prepare SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C toward high&#8208;performance sodium storage is developed. Because of the hierarchical structure, high conductivity, and abundant active sites, SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity, high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are promising electrodes for energy conversion/storage because of the layered structure and maximum atom utilization efficiency. However, the integration of such two type materials and the relevant sodium storage applications remain daunting challenges. Here, an ingenious diatomite&#8208;templated synthetic strategy is designed to fabricate single&#8208;atom cobalt&#8208;doped MoS2/carbon (SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C) composites toward the high&#8208;performance sodium storage. Benefiting from the unique hierarchical structure, high electron/sodium&#8208;ion conductivity, and abundant active sites, the obtained SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C reveals remarkable specific capacity (&#8776;604.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), high rate performance, and outstanding long cyclic stability. Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of SA Co&#8208;MoS2/C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode demonstrates unexpected stability with the cycle number exceeded 1200. The internal sodium storage mechanism is clarified with the aid of density functional theory calculations and in situ experimental characterizations. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of synthesizing SACs on 2D TMDCs but also provides a crucial step toward the practical sodium&#8208;ion battery applications.

         <title>Precise Engineering of a Se/Te Nanochaperone for Reinvigorating Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

A facile and universal method for synthesizing nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with well&#8208;controlled structure is reported. Dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs effectively facilitate radiotherapy by directly damaging tumor cells and shaping the tumor immuno&#8208;microenvironment, which endows&#160;combination treatment with great abscopal effects to combat distant tumor progression.








Abstract
Facilely synthesized nanoradiosensitizers with well&#8208;controlled structure and multifunctionality are greatly desired to address the challenges of cancer radiotherapy. In this work, a universal method is developed for synthesizing chalcogen&#8208;based TeSe nano&#8208;heterojunctions (NHJs) with rod&#8208;, spindle&#8208;, or dumbbell&#8208;like morphologies by engineering the surfactant and added selenite. Interestingly, dumbbell&#8208;shaped TeSe NHJs (TeSe NDs) as chaperone exhibit better radio&#8208;sensitizing activities than the other two nanostructural shapes. Meanwhile, TeSe NDs can serve as cytotoxic chemodrugs that degrade to highly toxic metabolites in acidic environment and deplete GSH within tumor to facilitate radiotherapy. More importantly, the combination of TeSe NDs with radiotherapy significantly decreases regulatory T cells and M2&#8208;phenotype tumor&#8208;associated macrophage infiltrations within tumors to reshape the immunosuppressive microenvironment and induce robust T lymphocytes&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, resulting in great abscopal effects on combating distant tumor progression. This study provides a universal method for preparing NHJ with well&#8208;controlled structure and developing nanoradiosensitizers to overcome the clinical challenges of cancer radiotherapy.

         <title>Acid and Hypoxia Tandem&#8208;Activatable Deep Near&#8208;Infrared Nanoprobe for Two&#8208;Step Signal Amplification and Early Detection of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>

A phosphorescent nanoprobe comprised of oxygen&#8208;sensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR)&#8208;emitting phosphorescence cores and acid&#8208;cleavable polyethene glycol (PEG) shells, that is ultrasensitive to tumor acidity and hypoxia. This tandem&#8208;activatable probe design specifically amplifies tumor signals and enables early tumor detection, the signal in deep NIR region promoting contrast and resolution of hypoxia imaging as well.








Abstract
The early detection of cancers can significantly change outcomes even with existing treatments. However, ~50% of cancers still cannot be detected until they reach an advanced stage, highlighting the great challenges in the early detection. Here, an ultrasensitive deep near&#8208;infrared (dNIR) nanoprobe that is successively responsive to tumor acidity and hypoxia is reported. It is demonstrated that the new nanoprobe specifically detects tumor hypoxia microenvironment based on deep NIR imaging in ten different types of tumor models using cancer cell lines and patient&#8208;tissue derived xenograft tumors. By combining the acidity and hypoxia specific two&#8208;step signal amplification with a deep NIR detection, the reported nanoprobe enables the ultrasensitive visualization of hundreds of tumor cells or small tumors with a size of 260&#160;&#181;m in whole&#8208;body imaging or 115&#160;&#181;m metastatic lesions in lung imaging. As a result, it reveals that tumor hypoxia can occur as early as the lesions contain only several hundred cancer cells.

         <title>Biomimetic Spun Silk Ionotronic Fibers for Intelligent Discrimination of Motions and Tactile Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by liquid crystal spinning of animal silks, the highly stretchable, tough, and resilient spun silk ionotronic fibers are prepared by dry spinning with nematic silk microfibril dope solution. They are further incorporated into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers to sort and recognize objects made of different materials.








Abstract
Innovation in the ionotronics field has significantly accelerated the development of ultraflexible devices and machines. However, it is still challenging to develop efficient ionotronic&#8208;based fibers with necessary stretchability, resilience, and conductivity due to inherent conflict in producing spinning dopes with both high polymer and ion concentrations and low viscosities. Inspired by the liquid crystalline spinning of animal silk, this study circumvents the inherent tradeoff in other spinning methods by dry spinning a nematic silk microfibril dope solution. The liquid crystalline texture allows the spinning dope to flow through the spinneret and form free&#8208;standing fibers under minimal external forces. The resultant silk&#8208;sourced ionotronic fibers (SSIFs) are highly stretchable, tough, resilient, and fatigue&#8208;resistant. These mechanical advantages ensure a rapid and recoverable electromechanical response of SSIFs to kinematic deformations. Further, the incorporation of SSIFs into core&#8211;shell triboelectric nanogenerator fibers provides outstanding stable and sensitive triboelectric response to precisely and sensitively perceive small pressures. Moreover, by implementing a combination of machine learning and Internet of Things techniques, the SSIFs can sort objects made of different materials. With these structural, processing, performance, and functional merits, the SSIFs prepared herein are expected to be applied in human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolytes are systematically explored, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. The optimal hydrogel electrolytes endow the Zn metal anode with a superior cycling lifespan and demonstrate great potential in wearable electronics with all flexible features.








Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes are widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted on optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. This work systematically analyzes the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salt and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. It shows that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. The potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS is exemplified in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector consisting of a Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This study provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering toward advanced Zn&#8208;ion battereis and the application in flexible devices.

         <title>A Smart DNA&#8208;Based Nanosystem Containing Ribosome&#8208;Regulating&#160;siRNA for Enhanced mRNA Transfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem with an siRNA&#8208;mediated regulation pathway that upregulates mRNA translation and enhances mRNA transfection is reported. The DNA&#8208;based nanosystem disassembles and releases siRNA and mRNA in response to intracellular stimuli and promotes ribosome biogenesis through intracellular glutathione depletion, which facilitates the mRNA delivery in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Messenger RNA (mRNA) transfection is the prerequisite for the application of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics. In hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells, such as macrophages, the effective transfection of mRNA remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. Herein, a smart DNA&#8208;based nanosystem is reported containing ribosome biogenesis&#8208;promoting siRNA, realizing efficient mRNA transfection in macrophages. Four monomers are copolymerized to form a nanoframework (NF), including N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) as the skeleton and acrydite&#8208;DNA as the initiator to trigger the cascade assembly of DNA hairpins (H1&#8208;polyT and H2&#8208;siRNA). By virtue of the phase transition characteristic of polymeric NIPAM, below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST, &#8776;34&#160;&#176;C), the NF swells to expose polyT sequences to hybridize with the polyA tail of mRNA. Above the LCST, the NF deswells to encapsulate mRNA. The disulfide bond in the NF responds to glutathione, triggering the disassembly of the nanosystem; the siRNA and mRNA are released in response to triphosadenine and RNase H. The siRNA down&#8208;regulates the expression of heat shock protein 27, which up&#8208;regulates the expression of phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6. The nanosystem shows satisfactory mRNA transfection and translation efficiency in a mouse model. It is envisioned that the DNA&#8208;based nanosystem will provide a promising carrier to deliver mRNA in hard&#8208;to&#8208;transfect cells and promote the development of mRNA&#8208;based therapeutics.

         <title>Wafer&#8208;Scale Epitaxial Growth of Two&#8208;dimensional Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method is developed to effectively suppress the multiple nucleation behavior of the molecules and enhance the 2D growth of organic crystals. In consequence, wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer organic single crystals are successfully fabricated on the viscous liquid substrate. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the crystal exhibit high device performance with excellent uniformity.








Abstract
The success of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electronics and optoelectronics relies heavily on the capability to fabricate semiconductor single&#8208;crystal wafers. However, the conventional epitaxial growth strategy for inorganic wafers is invalid for growing organic semiconductor single crystals due to the lack of lattice&#8208;matched epitaxial substrates and intricate nucleation behaviors, severely impeding the advancement of organic single&#8208;crystal electronics. Here, an anchored crystal&#8208;seed epitaxial growth method for wafer&#8208;scale growth of 2D organic semiconductor single crystals is developed for the first time. The crystal seed is firmly anchored on the viscous liquid surface, ensuring the steady epitaxial growth of organic single crystals from the crystal seed. The atomically flat liquid surface effectively eliminates the disturbance from substrate defects and greatly enhances the 2D growth of organic crystals. Using this approach, a wafer&#8208;scale few&#8208;layer bis(triethylsilythynyl)&#8208;anthradithphene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) single crystal is formed, yielding a breakthrough for organic field&#8208;effect transistors with a high reliable mobility up to 8.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an ultralow mobility variable coefficient of 8.9%. This work opens a new avenue to fabricate organic single&#8208;crystal wafers for high&#8208;performance organic electronics.

         <title>Boosting the Performance of Organic Photodetectors with a Solution&#8208;Processed Integration Circuit toward Ubiquitous Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.








Abstract
Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next&#8208;generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution&#8208;processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution&#8208;printed organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&#8722;1, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit.

&lt;p&gt;A solution-processed integration circuit consisting of an organic field-effect transistor with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency, an organic photoconductor, and an organic resistor is proposed to dramatically boost the photoresponse signal-to-noise ratio, enabling the accurate extraction of physiological information from the photoplethysmographic waveforms, which can promote the development of ubiquitous health monitoring.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic photodetectors, as an emerging wearable photoplethysmographic (PPG) technology, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic healthcare electronics. However, the mutual restraints among photoresponse, structure complexity, and fabrication cost have intrinsically limited the development of organic photodetectors for ubiquitous health monitoring in daily activities. Here, an effective route to dramatically boost the performance of organic photodetectors with a solution-processed integration circuit for health monitoring application is reported. Through creating an ideal metal&#8211;semiconductor junction interface that minimizes the trap states within the device, solution-printed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are achieved with an ultrahigh signal amplification efficiency of 37.1 S A&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, approaching the theoretical thermionic limit. Consequently, monolithic integration of the OFET with an organic photoconductor enables the remarkable amplification of photoresponse signal-to-noise ratio by more than four orders of magnitude from 5.5 to 4.6 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, which is able to meet the demand for accurately extracting physiological information from the PPG waveforms. This work offers an effective and versatile approach to greatly enhance the photodetector performance, promising to revolutionize health monitoring technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially&#8208;Encoding Hydrogels With DNA to Control Cell Signaling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the synthesis and photopatterning of hydrogels with multiple, discrete DNA domains, single&#8208;micron resolution spatial control is achieved over chemical composition and function. DNA's sequence specificity is used to reversibly tether DNA and direct protein attachment in patterned domains. Importantly, it is shown that reporter cells preferentially activate in regions of patterned hydrogels containing biomolecular signals.








Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry is introduced. Rapid hydrogel photopatterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8776;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Last, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8211;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially&#8208;encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Less&#8208;Suture Vascular Anastomosis: Development of Alternative Protocols with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Wrapping, Transparent, Adhesive, and Elastic Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adhesive, hemostatic, transparent, and elastic films are developed in this study to be used in &#8220;less&#8208;suture anastomosis&#8221; for blood vessels. It extensively decreases the number of sutures for vascular anastomosis and overall surgical time to a life&#8208;saving level in both normal and coagulopathy animal models.








Abstract
Blood vessel anastomosis by suture is a life&#8208;saving, yet time&#8208;consuming and labor&#8208;intensive operation. While suture&#8208;less alternatives utilizing clips or related devices are developed to address these shortcomings, suture anastomosis is still overwhelmingly used in most cases. In this study, practical &#8220;less&#8208;suture&#8221; strategies are proposed, rather than ideal &#8220;suture&#8208;less&#8221; methods, to reflect real&#8208;world clinical situations. In the case of rat artery (d = 0.64&#160;mm) anastomosis, the less&#8208;suture anastomosis involves the application of thin, adhesive, transparent, and self&#8208;wrapping films to the site. This surprisingly reduces the number of stitches required from ten (without films) to four (with films), saving 27&#160;min of operating time per vessel. Furthermore, the decreased number of stitches largely alleviates fibrosis&#8208;mediated wall&#8208;thickening. Thus, a less&#8208;suture strategy is particularly useful for anastomosis of multiple vessels in emergency conditions and small&#8208;diameter vessels.

         <title>In Situ Activation of Snap&#8208;Through Instability in Multi&#8208;Response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Contact&#8208;induced topological transformation is leveraged to introduce a highly versatile multistable metamaterial capable of switching its mechanical response post fabrication. The authors demonstrate how the in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of snap&#8208;through instability enable to generate non&#8208;volatile mechanical logic operations and to reprogram energy dissipation.








Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.

         <title>Targeted Reprogramming of Vitamin B3 Metabolism as a Nanotherapeutic Strategy towards Chemoresistant Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) maintain cancer stem cell stemness and promote immunosuppression, leading to chemoresistance and immune escape. Gemini&#8208;like nanoparticles are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF reprogramming and cancer cell elimination. CAF&#8208;targeting nanoparticles transform CAFs into quiescent fibroblasts via a cascade of Vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming and chromatin remodeling and thereby rehabilitate chemosensitivity and immune activation in chemoresistant breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote cancer stem cell (CSC)&#8208;mediated chemoresistance and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, direct depletion of CAFs may increase cancer invasiveness and metastasis. As a generalized strategy against chemoresistant cancers, Gemini&#8208;like homotypic targeting nanoparticles (NPs) are designed for two&#8208;pronged CAF transformation and cancer cell elimination. The CAF&#8208;targeted NPs couple vitamin B3 metabolic reprogramming to epigenetic modulation of secreted pro&#8208;stemness and immunosuppressive factors, thereby diminishing CSC and suppressive immune cell populations to enhance cancer cell drug susceptibility and cytotoxic T cell infiltration. In mouse models of breast, liver, pancreatic and colorectal cancers that are resistant to their respective first&#8208;line chemotherapeutics, a single dose of hydrogel co&#8208;delivering the Gemini&#8208;like NPs can rehabilitate chemosensitivity, induce immune activation, and achieve tumor regression. Moreover, it stimulates robust T cell memory for long&#8208;term protection against tumor rechallenge. This study thus represents an innovative approach with broad applicability for overcoming cancer chemoresistance.

         <title>Tailored Lattice Compressive Strain of Pt&#8208;Skins by the L12&#8208;Pt3M Intermetallic Core for Highly Efficient Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong confinement effect induced by modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC effectively ensures the ultrasmall size of Pt&#8208;based intermetallics and enhances the durability of the catalyst. The strain of Pt skins imposed by intermetallic cores is tailored to optimize the adsorption properties of the catalyst for intermediates of oxygen reduction reaction, resulting in highly effective and durable oxygen reduction.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and unsatisfactory durability of Pt&#8208;based catalysts are severely hindering the commercialization of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, the lattice compressive strain of Pt&#8208;skins imposed by Pt&#8208;based intermetallic cores is tailored for highly effective ORR through the confinement effect of the activated nitrogen&#8208;doped porous carbon (a&#8208;NPC). The modulated pores of a&#8208;NPC not only promote Pt&#8208;based intermetallics with ultrasmall size (average size of &lt;4&#160;nm), but also efficiently stabilizes intermetallic nanoparticles&#160;and sufficient exposure of active sites during the ORR process. The optimized catalyst (L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10) achieves excellent mass activity (1.72 A mgPt&#8722;1) and specific activity (3.49&#160;mA cmPt&#8722;2), which are 11&#8208; and 15&#8208;fold that of commercial Pt/C, respectively. Besides, owing to the confinement effect of a&#8208;NPC and protection of Pt&#8208;skins, L12&#8208;Pt3Co@ML&#8208;Pt/NPC10 retains 98.1% mass activity after 30&#160;000 cycles, and even 95% for 100&#160;000 cycles, while Pt/C retains only 51.2% for 30&#160;000 cycles. Rationalized by density functional theory, compared with other metals (Cr, Mn, Fe, and Zn), L12&#8208;Pt3Co closer to the top of &#8220;volcano&#8221; induces a more suitable compressive strain and electronic structure on Pt&#8208;skin, leading to an optimal oxygen adsorption energy and a remarkable ORR performance.

         <title>Induction of Metabolic Reprogramming in Kidney by Singlet Diradical Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible nanoparticles are assembled from a diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene compound with a singlet diradical ground state. It is found that such nanoparticles can induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids by promoting fatty acid degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation under redox homeostasis with an increased level of glutathione.








Abstract
Polycyclic aromatic compounds with an open&#8208;shell singlet diradical ground state, namely singlet diradicals, have recently gained attention in the fields of organic electronics, photovoltaics, and spintronics owing to their unique electronic structures and properties. Notably, singlet diradicals exhibit tunable redox amphoterism, which makes them excellent redox&#8208;active materials for biomedical applications. However, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of singlet diradicals in biological systems have not yet been explored. Herein, the study presents a newly designed singlet diradical nanomaterial, diphenyl&#8208;substituted biolympicenylidene (BO&#8208;Ph), exhibiting low cytotoxicity in vitro, non&#8208;significant acute nephrotoxicity in vivo, and the ability to induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids. Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses reveal that the metabolism of BO&#8208;Ph stimulates glutathione (GSH) synthesis and fatty acid degradation, increases the levels of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) and carnitine cycles, and eventually boosts oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under redox homeostasis. Benefits of BO&#8208;Ph&#8208;induce metabolic reprogramming in kidney organoids include enhancing cellular antioxidant capacity and promoting mitochondrial function. The results of this study can facilitate the application of singlet diradical materials in the treatment of clinical conditions induced by mitochondrial abnormalities in kidney.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Unique Chirality Selection in Neural Cells for D&#8208;Matrix Enabling Specific Manipulation of Cell Behaviors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The D&#8208;matrix chirality enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival of neural cells by attenuating the interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and matrixes, subsequently activating JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways, while the proliferation and adhesion of non&#8208;neural cells are promoted on the L&#8208;matrix, which provides a specific method to universally manipulate neural cell behaviors with chiral biomaterial systems.








Abstract
Manipulating neural cell behaviors is a critical issue to various therapies for neurological diseases and damages, where matrix chirality has long been overlooked despite the proven adhesion and proliferation improvement of multiple non&#8208;neural cells by L&#8208;matrixes. Here, it is reported that the D&#8208;matrix chirality specifically enhances cell density, viability, proliferation, and survival in four different types of neural cells, contrasting its inhibition in non&#8208;neural cells. This universal impact on neural cells is defined as &#8220;chirality selection for D&#8208;matrix&#8221; and is achieved through the activation of JNK and p38/MAPK signaling pathways by the cellular tension relaxation resulting from the weak interaction between D&#8208;matrix and cytoskeleton proteins, particularly actin. Also, D&#8208;matrix promotes sciatic nerve repair effectively, both with or without non&#8208;neural stem cell implantation, by improving the population, function, and myelination of autologous Schwann cells. D&#8208;matrix chirality, as a simple, safe, and effective microenvironment cue to specifically and universally manipulate neural cell behaviors, holds extensive application potential in addressing neurological issues such as nerve regeneration, neurodegenerative disease treatment, neural tumor targeting, and neurodevelopment.

         <title>A Recyclable Standalone Microporous Layer with Interpenetrating Network for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon nanotubes interpenetrating network is employed to prepare a standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with high strength and gas permeability. The high&#8208;performance standalone MPL can greatly extend the service lifetime of gas diffusion layers and reduce the costs of recovering catalyst coated membranes. Therefore, the standalone MPL is promising to significantly improve the sustainability of fuel cells.








Abstract
The commercialization of fuel cells inevitably brings recycling problems. Therefore, achieving high recyclability of fuel cells is particularly important for their sustainable development. In this work, a recyclable standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with interpenetrating network that can significantly enhance the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells is prepared. The interpenetrating network enables the standalone MPL to have high strength (17.7&#160;MPa), gas permeability (1.55&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;13&#160;m2), and fuel&#8208;cell performance (peak power density 1.35&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), providing the basic guarantee for its application in high&#8208;performance and highly recyclable fuel cells. Additionally, the standalone MPL is highly adaptable to various gas&#8208;diffusion backings (GDBs), providing high possibility to select highly recyclable GDBs. Outstandingly, anode standalone MPLs and GDBs can be easily detached from the spent membrane electrode assembly (MEA). This not only saves &gt;90 vol% solvent in the recovery of the catalyst&#8208;coated membrane (CCM), but also extends the service life of the GDBs and the anode standalone MPL at least 138 times (2 760 000&#160;h assuming 20 000&#160;h of CCM) comparing to CCM. Therefore, the standalone MPL significantly enhances the recyclability and sustainability of fuel cells and is promising to be an indispensable component in the next&#8208;generation fuel cells.

&lt;p&gt;Carbon nanotubes interpenetrating network is employed to prepare a standalone microporous layer (standalone MPL) with high strength and gas permeability. The high-performance standalone MPL can greatly extend the service lifetime of gas diffusion layers and reduce the costs of recovering catalyst coated membranes. Therefore, the standalone MPL is promising to significantly improve the sustainability of fuel cells.

         <title>Fabrication of Single&#8208;Crystalline CoCrFeNi Thin Films by DC Magnetron Sputtering: A Route to Surface Studies of High&#8208;Entropy Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The epitaxial growth of the high&#8208;entropy alloy CoCrFeNi on MgO(100) by DC magnetron sputtering is demonstrated. The surface reconstruction and electronic band structure of the CoCrFeNi(100) surface is investigated by low&#8208;energy electron diffraction and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, demonstrating the potential of epitaxial films for fundamental studies of low&#8208;index HEA surfaces.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) with their almost limitless number of possible compositions have raised widespread attention in material science. Next to wear and corrosion resistive coatings, their application as tunable electrocatalysts has recently moved into the focus. On the other hand, fundamental properties of HEA surfaces like atomic and electronic structure, surface segregation and diffusion as well as adsorption on HEA surfaces are barely explored. The lack of research is caused by the limited availability of single&#8208;crystalline samples. In the present work, the epitaxial growth of face centered cubic (fcc) CoCrFeNi films on MgO(100) is reported. Their characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy (EDX), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrates that the layers with a homogeneous and close to equimolar elemental composition are oriented in [100] direction and aligned with the substrate to which they form an abrupt interface. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), low&#8208;energy electron diffraction (LEED), and angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to study chemical composition and atomic and electronic structure of CoCrFeNi(100). It is demonstrated that epitaxially grown HEA films have the potential to fill the sample gap, allowing for fundamental studies of properties of and processes on well&#8208;defined HEA surfaces over the full compositional&#160;space.

         <title>Flowthrough Capture of Microplastics through Polyphenol&#8208;Mediated Interfacial Interactions on Wood Sawdust</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are developed based on wood sawdust support for the removal of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water. Due to the unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions, bioCap is capable of capturing a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics with various types (six types), surface charges (anionic, cationic, and neutral), and shapes (spherical and irregular).








Abstract
Nano&#8208;/microplastics accumulate in aquatic bodies and raise increasing threats to ecosystems and human health. The limitation of existing water cleanup strategies, especially in the context of nano&#8208;/microplastics, primarily arises from their complexity (morphological, compositional, and dimensional). Here, highly efficient and bio&#8208;based flowthrough capturing materials (bioCap) are reported to remove a broad spectrum of nano&#8208;/microplastics from water: polyethylene terephthalate (anionic, irregular shape), polyethylene (net neutral, irregular shape), polystyrene (anionic and cationic, spherical shape), and other anionic and spherical shaped particles (polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyvinyl chloride). Highly efficient bioCap systems that adsorb the ubiquitous particles released from beverage bags are demonstrated. As evidence of removal from drinking water, the in vivo biodistribution of nano&#8208;/microplastics is profiled, confirming a significant reduction of particle accumulation in main organs. The unique advantage of phenolic&#8208;mediated multi&#8208;molecular interactions is employed in sustainable, cost&#8208;effective, and facile strategies based on wood sawdust support for the removal of challenging nano&#8208;/microplastics pollutions.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
TACS keeps stable in gastrointestinal tract and targets the inflammatory lesions efficiently and accurately. TACS has specific CT imaging for IBD and alleviates the five major pathological features of IBD including alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, anti&#8208;inflammation, restoring barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiome.








Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) is evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS is modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptors. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function, and strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

&lt;p&gt;TACS keeps stable in gastrointestinal tract and targets the inflammatory lesions efficiently and accurately. TACS has specific CT imaging for IBD and alleviates the five major pathological features of IBD including alleviating oxidative stress, inhibiting apoptosis, anti-inflammation, restoring barrier function, and modulating the gut microbiome.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) is evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS is modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion-specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptors. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function, and strong reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non-invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first-line drug 5-aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Surface Electronic Structure Engineering of Manganese Bismuth Tellurides Guided by Micro&#8208;Focused Angle&#8208;Resolved Photoemission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dramatic modifications of the surface electronic structures of the magnetic topological insulator compounds MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 are directly visualized using micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. A general method to achieve a minimal dispersion with topological bands close to the Fermi energy is demonstrated across the compounds.








Abstract
Modification of the electronic structure of quantum matter by ad atom deposition allows for directed fundamental design of electronic and magnetic properties. This concept is utilized in the present study in order to tune the surface electronic structure of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi2Te4. The topological bands of these systems are typically strongly electron&#8208;doped and hybridized with a manifold of surface states that place the salient topological states out of reach of electron transport and practical applications. In this study, micro&#8208;focused angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (microARPES) provides direct access to the termination&#8208;dependent dispersion of MnBi2Te4 and MnBi4Te7 during in situ deposition of rubidium atoms. The resulting band structure changes are found to be highly complex, encompassing coverage&#8208;dependent ambipolar doping effects, removal of surface state hybridization, and the collapse of a surface state band gap. In addition, doping&#8208;dependent band bending is found to give rise to tunable quantum well states. This wide range of observed electronic structure modifications can provide new ways to exploit the topological states and the rich surface electronic structures of manganese bismuth&#160;tellurides.

         <title>Single&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Hydrogel Electrolytes Based on Slide&#8208;Ring Pseudo&#8208;Polyrotaxane for Ultralong&#8208;Cycling Flexible Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte is developed by confining the anions between two ring&#8208;shaped cyclodextrins to allow Zn2+ transfer along the outside of the rings. It delivers a large Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and exhibits an excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles in flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries at 5 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with high capacity and long cycle stability are essential for wearable electronic devices. Hydrogel electrolytes have been developed to provide ion&#8208;transfer channels while maintaining the integrity of ZIBs under mechanical strain. However, hydrogel matrices are typically swollen with aqueous salt solutions to increase ionic conductivity, which can hinder intimate contact with electrodes and reduce mechanical properties. To address this, a single&#8208;Zn&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolyte (SIHE) is developed by integrating polyacrylamide network and pseudo&#8208;polyrotaxane structure. The SIHE exhibits a high Zn2+ transference number of 0.923 and a high ionic conductivity of 22.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Symmetric batteries with SIHE demonstrate stable Zn plating/stripping performance for over 160 h, with a homogenous and smooth Zn deposition layer. Full cells with La&#8208;V2O5 cathodes exhibit a high capacity of 439 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and excellent capacity retention of 90.2% after 3500 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. Moreover, the flexible ZIBs display stable electrochemical performance under harsh conditions, such as bending, cutting, puncturing, and soaking. This work provides a simple design strategy for single&#8208;ion&#8208;conducting hydrogel electrolytes, which could pave the way for long&#8208;life aqueous batteries.

Bright deep&#8208;red fluorescent carbon dots (CDs) with an ultra&#8208;narrow FWHM of 21 nm and a high quantum yield of 52% are prepared by readily available green plants. High color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these CDs are demonstrated for the first time with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307) by using an exciplex host.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm, and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, this work reports the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color&#8208;purity monochrome emission from deep&#8208;red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer (FET). The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs display high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of the knowledge, this is the first report of high color&#8208;purity CD&#8208;LEDs in the deep&#8208;red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high&#8208;resolution light&#8208;emitting display technologies.

         <title>Ultralow Tip&#8208;Force Driven Sizable&#8208;Area Domain Manipulation through Transverse Flexoelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to activate the transverse flexoelectricity with a widely influenced range through the flexural suspended films. Sizable&#8208;area (2500 times larger than the tip&#8208;surface contact area) domain switching is successfully realized in hundreds of nanometer&#8208;thick (up to 550 nm) van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP2S6, driving by a single&#8208;point ultralow tip&#8208;force with the surface intact.








Abstract
Deterministic control of ferroelectric domain is critical in the ferroelectric functional electronics. Ferroelectric polarization can be manipulated mechanically with a nano&#8208;tip through flexoelectricity. However, it usually occurs in a very localized area in ultrathin films, with possible permanent surface damage caused by a large tip&#8208;force.

     alt="Ultralow Tip-Force Driven Sizable-Area Domain Manipulation through Transverse Flexoelectricity"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy is proposed to activate the transverse flexoelectricity with a widely influenced range through the flexural suspended films. Sizable-area (2500 times larger than the tip-surface contact area) domain switching is successfully realized in hundreds of nanometer-thick (up to 550 nm) van der Waals ferroelectric CuInP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, driving by a single-point ultralow tip-force with the surface intact.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deterministic control of ferroelectric domain is critical in the ferroelectric functional electronics. Ferroelectric polarization can be manipulated mechanically with a nano-tip through flexoelectricity. However, it usually occurs in a very localized area in ultrathin films, with possible permanent surface damage caused by a large tip-force. Here it is demonstrated that the deliberate engineering of transverse flexoelectricity offers a powerful tool for improving the mechanical domain switching. Sizable-area domain switching under an ultralow tip-force can be realized in suspended van der Waals ferroelectrics with the surface intact, due to the enhanced transverse flexoelectric field. The film thickness range for domain switching in suspended ferroelectrics is significantly improved by an order of magnitude to hundreds of nanometers, being far beyond the limited range of the substrate-supported ones. The experimental results and phase-field simulations further reveal the crucial role of the transverse flexoelectricity in the domain manipulation. This large-scale mechanical manipulation of ferroelectric domain provides opportunities for the flexoelectricity-based domain controls in emerging low-dimensional ferroelectrics and related devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synthesis of High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles by a Step&#8208;Alloying Strategy as a Superior Multifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to prepare a series of high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticle (HEA&#8208;NP) systems that contain many strongly immiscible element pairs, including Bi&#8211;W with the highest &#916;Hmix of 45&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. This strategy further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is significant for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy nanoparticles (HEA&#8208;NPs) have attracted great attention because of their unique complex compositions and tailorable properties. Further expanding the compositional space is of great significance for enriching the material library. Here, a step&#8208;alloying strategy is developed to synthesis HEA&#8208;NPs containing a range of strongly repellent elements (e.g., Bi&#8211;W) by using the rich&#8208;Pt cores formed during the first liquid phase reaction as the seed of the second thermal diffusion. Remarkably, the representative HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) with up to 14 elements exhibits extremely excellent multifunctional electrocatalytic performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Briefly, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) only requires the ultralow overpotentials of 11 and 18&#160;mV to deliver 10&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and exhibits ultralong durability for 400 and 264&#160;h under 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4 and 1&#160;m KOH, respectively, which surpasses most advanced pH&#8208;universal HER catalysts. Moreover, HEA&#8208;NPs&#8208;(14) also exhibits an impressive peak current density of 12.6&#8201;A&#8201;mg&#8722;1Pt in 1&#160;m KOH&#160;+&#160;1&#160;m MeOH and a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86&#160;V (vs RHE.) in 0.1&#160;m KOH. The work further expands the spectrum of possible metal alloys, which is important for the broad compositional space and future data&#8208;driven material discovery.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Intercalation Dominated Ferromagnetism of van der Waals Fe3GeTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe intercalation on the interstitial sites in high Curie temperature (Tc) Fe3GeTe2 may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc.








Abstract
Fe3GeTe2 have proven to be of greatly intrigue. However, the underlying mechanism behind the varying Curie temperature (Tc) values remains a puzzle. This study explores the atomic structure of Fe3GeTe2 crystals exhibiting Tc values of 160, 210, and 230 K. The elemental mapping reveals a Fe&#8208;intercalation on the interstitial sites within the van der Waals gap of the high&#8208;Tc (210 and 230 K) samples, which are observed to have an exchange bias effect by electrical transport measurements, while Fe intercalation or the bias effect is absent in the low&#8208;Tc (160 K) samples. First&#8208;principles calculations further suggest that the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer may be responsible for the local antiferromagnetic coupling that gives rise to the exchange bias effect, and that the interlayer exchange paths greatly contribute to the enhancement of Tc. This discovery of the Fe&#8208;intercalation layer elucidates the mechanism behind the hidden antiferromagnetic ordering that underlies the enhancement of Tc in Fe3GeTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Knitting Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) actuators are additively manufactured from LCE fibers by knitting technology. The obtained knitted LCE actuators with diverse 3D geometry can be rationally designed and perform programmed deformability. The knitted LCE actuators can be fully recycled, and its functionality can be further extended by threading and stitching. This study introduces a new avenue for the fabrication of LCE actuators.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) exhibits large and reversible deformability originating from the alignment of liquid crystal mesogens. Additive manufacturing provides high controllability in the alignment and shaping process of LCE actuators. However, it still remains a challenge to customize LCE actuators with both diverse 3D deformability and recyclability. In this study, a new strategy is developed to exploit knitting technique to additively manufacture LCE actuators. The obtained LCE actuators are fabric&#8208;structured with designed geometry and deformability. By accurately adjusting the parameters of the knitting patterns as modules, diverse geometry is pixel&#8208;wise designed, and complex 3D deformations including bending, twisting, and folding are quantitatively controlled. In addition, the fabric&#8208;structured LCE actuators can be threaded, stitched, and reknitted to achieve advanced geometry, integrated multi&#8208;functions and efficient recyclability. This approach allows the fabrication of versatile LCE actuators with potential applications in smart textiles and soft robots.

         <title>Toughening CO2&#8208;Derived Copolymer Elastomers Through Ionomer Networking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and properties of CO2&#8208;derived block polymer thermoplastic elastomers and ionomers, with Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III) (&lt;1&#160;wt% metal), are reported. The materials show wide operating temperatures, &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength than unfunctionalized materials, high elastic recovery, and creep&#8208;resistance, and are recyclable.








Abstract
Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) to make polycarbonates through the ring&#8208;opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO2 and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO2 and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well&#8208;defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass&#8208;derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are underinvestigated. Here, new types of CO2&#8208;derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re&#8208;design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (Tg) amorphous blocks comprising CO2&#8208;derived poly(carbonates) (A&#8208;block), with low Tg poly(&#949;&#8208;decalactone), from castor oil, (B&#8208;block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal&#8208;carboxylates where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &lt;1&#160;wt% metal, show tunable thermal (Tg), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep&#8208;resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &gt;50&#8208;fold higher Young's modulus and 21&#8208;times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8722;20 to 200&#160;&#176;C), high creep&#8208;resistance and yet remain recyclable.

&lt;p&gt;The preparation and properties of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived block polymer thermoplastic elastomers and ionomers, with Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III) (&amp;lt;1&#160;wt% metal), are reported. The materials show wide operating temperatures, &amp;gt;50-fold higher Young's modulus and 21-times greater tensile strength than unfunctionalized materials, high elastic recovery, and creep-resistance, and are recyclable.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to make polycarbonates through the ring-opening copolymerization (ROCOP) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxides valorizes and recycles CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and reduces pollution in polymer manufacturing. Recent developments in catalysis provide access to polycarbonates with well-defined structures and allow for copolymerization with biomass-derived monomers; however, the resulting material properties are underinvestigated. Here, new types of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) are described together with a generally applicable method to augment tensile mechanical strength and Young's modulus without requiring material re-design. These TPEs combine high glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;) amorphous blocks comprising CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived poly(carbonates) (A-block), with low &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; poly(&lt;i&gt;&#949;&lt;/i&gt;-decalactone), from castor oil, (B-block) in ABA structures. The poly(carbonate) blocks are selectively functionalized with metal-carboxylates where the metals are Na(I), Mg(II), Ca(II), Zn(II) and Al(III). The colorless polymers, featuring &amp;lt;1&#160;wt% metal, show tunable thermal (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and mechanical (elongation at break, elasticity, creep-resistance) properties. The best elastomers show &amp;gt;50-fold higher Young's modulus and 21-times greater tensile strength, without compromise to elastic recovery, compared with the starting block polymers. They have wide operating temperatures (&#8722;20 to 200&#160;&#176;C), high creep-resistance and yet remain recyclable. In the future, these materials may substitute high-volume petrochemical elastomers and be utilized in high-growth fields like medicine, robotics, and electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial Passivation Enormously Enhances Electroluminescence of Triphenylphosphine Cu4I4 Cube</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cluster light&#8208;emitting diodes based on mono&#8208;dentate ligands with high luminance and efficiencies are realized through a non&#8208;doped bilayer structure of [TPP]4Cu4I4|TmPyPB, in which pyridine&#8208;capped TmPyPB effectively passivates surface defects of [TPP]4Cu4I4 layer to prevent interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation, resulting in &#8776;200 and 23 folds increased luminance and external quantum efficiency, respectively.








Abstract
Defect is one of the key factors limiting optoelectronic performances of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid systems. Although high&#8208;efficiency bidentate ligands based electroluminescent (EL) clusters reported, until present, only few EL clusters based on monodentate ligands are realized since their structural instability induces more surface/interface defects. Herein, this bottleneck is first overcome in virtue of interfacial passivation by electron transporting layers (ETL). Through using TmPyPB with meta&#8208;linked pyridines as ETL, photoluminescent (PL) and EL quantum efficiencies of the simplest monophosphine Cu4I4 cube [TPP]4Cu4I4 are greatly improved by &#8776;2 and 23 folds, respectively, as well as &#8776;200 folds increased luminance, corresponding to a huge leap from nearly unlighted (&lt;20 nits) to highly bright (&gt;3000 nits). The passivation effect of TmPyPB on surface defects of cluster layer is embodied as preventing interfacial charge trapping and suppressing exciton nonradiation.

         <title>4D Visualization of a Nonthermal Coherent Magnon in a Laser Heated Lattice by an X&#8208;ray Free Electron Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment using an X&#8208;ray free electron laser visualizes a light&#8208;induced coherent magnon in a multiferroic. The magnon trajectory in time and 3D space unveils the photomagnetic coupling largely enhanced by above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, distinguished from a laser&#8208;heated magnetic behavior. This energy&#8208;efficient photoexcitation process suggests the potential for a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.








Abstract
Ultrafast optical manipulation of magnetic phenomena is an exciting achievement of mankind, expanding one's horizon of knowledge toward the functional nonequilibrium states. The dynamics acting on an extremely short timescale push the detection limits that reveal fascinating light&#8211;matter interactions for nonthermal creation of effective magnetic fields. While some cases are benchmarked by emergent transient behaviors, otherwise identifying the nonthermal effects remains challenging. Here, a femtosecond time&#8208;resolved resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction experiment is introduced, which uses an X&#8208;ray free&#8208;electron laser (XFEL) to distinguish between the effective field and the photoinduced thermal effect. It is observed that a multiferroic Y&#8208;type hexaferrite exhibits magnetic Bragg peak intensity oscillations manifesting entangled antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Fourier components of a coherent AFM magnon. The magnon trajectory constructed in 3D space and time domains is decisive to evince ultrafast field formation preceding the lattice thermalization. A remarkable impact of photoexcitation across the electronic bandgap is directly unraveled, amplifying the photomagnetic coupling that is one of the highest among AFM dielectrics. Leveraging the above&#8208;bandgap photoexcitation, this energy&#8208;efficient optical process further suggests a novel photomagnetic control of ferroelectricity in multiferroics.

Robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier are accessible, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond and shows promising applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
In miniaturized electronic and optoelectronic circuits, molecular tunnel junctions have attracted enormous research interest due to their small footprint, low power consumption, and rich molecular functions. However, the most popular building blocks used in contemporary molecular tunnel junctions are thiol molecules, which attach to electrode surfaces via a metal&#8208;thiolate (M&#63743;S) bond, showing low stability and usually quick degradation within several days. To pave the way for more widely applicable and stable molecular tunnel junctions, there is a need to develop new molecular anchoring groups. Here, this work&#160;demonstrates robust and air&#8208;stable molecular tunnel junctions with a sub&#8208;5 nanometer bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based thin film as the tunneling barrier, which anchors to the electrode surface via a Au&#63743;C bond. The bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions exhibit high thermal stability against heating up to 200 &#176;C and long storage lifetime over 5 months in an ambient environment. Both electrical and optical performance of these bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular junctions are&#160;characterized systematically, showing similar behaviors to thiol&#8208;based junctions as well as largely improved emission stability. This research highlights the excellent performance of bis(diarylcarbene)&#8208;based molecular tunnel junctions, which could&#160;be useful for applications in molecular electronics and plasmonics.

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phaseand mitigating random phases. As a result, the optimized device delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%.








Abstract
2D perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, a seed&#8208;induced growth approach is introduced employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. The impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites is systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 h of storage.

This method yields high-quality perovskite films as the seeds serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA-based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; phaseand mitigating random phases. As a result, the optimized device delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA-based 2D perovskites produced via one-step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi-quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, a seed-induced growth approach is introduced employing MAPbCl&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and BDAPbI&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; in the deposition of FA-based Dion-Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high-quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA-based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (&lt;i&gt;n =&lt;/i&gt; 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. The impact of seed-induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA-based 2D perovskites is systematically investigated. As a result, the optimized FA-based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 h of storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Planar Spin Glass with Topologically&#160;Protected Mazes in the Liquid Crystal Targeting for Reconfigurable Micro Security Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The deterministic and non&#8208;deterministic properties of a topologically&#160;protected maze in the&#160;chiral liquid crystal (LC) resulting from microscopic order and macroscopic disorder accomplish a security system that serves as advanced artificial fingerprints. This system enables facile authentication through deep&#8208;learning technology and can reconstruct information through the phase transition of LCs.








Abstract
The planar spin glass pattern is widely known for its inherent randomness, resulting from the geometrical frustration. As such, developing physical unclonable functions (PUFs)&#8212;which operate with device randomness&#8212;with planar spin glass patterns is a promising candidate for an advanced security systems in the upcoming digitalized society. Despite their inherent randomness, traditional magnetic spin glass patterns pose considerable obstacles in detection, making it challenging to achieve authentication in security systems. This necessitates the development of facilely observable mimetic patterns with similar randomness to overcome these challenges. Here, a straightforward approach is introduced using a topologically&#160;protected maze pattern in the chiral liquid crystals (LCs). This maze exhibits a comparable level of randomness to magnetic spin glass and can be reliably identified through the combination of optical microscopy with machine learning&#8208;based object detection techniques. The &#8220;information&#8221; embedded in the maze can be reconstructed through thermal phase transitions of the LCs in tens of seconds. Furthermore, incorporating various elements can enhance the optical PUF, resulting in a multi&#8208;factor security medium. It is expected that this security medium, based on microscopically controlled and macroscopically uncontrolled topologically&#160;protected structures, may be utilized as a next&#8208;generation security system.

         <title>A Personalized Cancer Vaccine that Induces Synergistic Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An autologous extracellular nanovesicle vaccine derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells directly activates both innate immune cells and AML&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells without having to define tumor antigens. It induces strong antitumor immune memory and synergizes with chemotherapy to prevent relapse in hosts with AML. Thus, it can be developed as a platform for personalized vaccines in humans.








Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, extracellular nanovesicles derived from alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC) are presented as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engages with and activates both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently serves as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that can directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multifaceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination results in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activate iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

         <title>A Photopatternable Conjugated Polymer with Thermal&#8208;Annealing&#8208;Promoted Interchain Stacking for Highly Stable Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are designed using a photopatternable conjugated polymer with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking. To prepare anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the polymer is irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, and thermally annealed under a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Photoresponsive polymers can be conveniently used to fabricate anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials through photopatterning. However, an unsolved problem is that ambient light and heat can damage anti&#8208;counterfeiting patterns on photoresponsive polymers. Herein, photo&#8208; and thermostable anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials are developed by photopatterning and thermal annealing of a photoresponsive conjugated polymer (MC&#8208;Azo). MC&#8208;Azo contains alternating azobenzene and fluorene units in the polymer backbone. To prepare an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material, an MC&#8208;Azo film is irradiated with polarized blue light through a photomask, and then thermally annealed under the pressure of a photonic stamp. This strategy generates a highly secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with dual patterns, which is stable to sunlight and heat over 200&#160;&#176;C. A key for the stability is that thermal annealing promotes interchain stacking, which converts photoresponsive MC&#8208;Azo to a photostable material. Another key for the stability is that the conjugated structure endows MC&#8208;Azo with desirable thermal properties. This study shows that the design of photopatternable conjugated polymers with thermal&#8208;annealing&#8208;promoted interchain stacking provides a new strategy for the development of highly stable and secure anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Water&#8208;Induced Bandgap Engineering in Nanoribbons of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective bandgap modulation of water&#8208;adsorbed zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) is reported. A water layer adsorbed at the edges creates a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces its bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs with adsorbates of water can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via electrical field modulation at room temperature.








Abstract
Different from hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) sheets, the bandgap of hBN nanoribbons (BNNRs) can be changed by spatial/electrostatic confinement. It is predicted that a transverse electric field can narrow the bandgap and even cause an insulator&#8211;metal transition in BNNRs. However, experimentally introducing an overhigh electric field across the BNNR remains challenging. Here, it is&#160;theoretically and experimentally demonstrated that water adsorption greatly reduces the bandgap of zigzag&#8208;oriented BNNRs (zBNNRs). Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&#8722;1 accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field&#8208;effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water&#8208;adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study offers fundamental insights into new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.

Ab initio calculations show that water molecules can be favorably assembled within the trench between two adjacent BNNRs to form a polar ice layer, which induces a transverse equivalent electric field of over 2&#160;V&#160;nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; accounting for the bandgap reduction. Field-effect transistors are&#160;successfully fabricated from zBNNRs with different widths. The conductance of water-adsorbed zBNNRs can&#160;be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via modulation of the equivalent electrical field at room temperature. Furthermore, photocurrent response measurements are&#160;taken to determine the optical bandgaps of zBNNRs with water adsorption. The zBNNR with increased width can exhibit a bandgap down to 1.17&#160;eV. This study offers fundamental insights into new routes toward realizing electronic/optoelectronic devices and circuits based on hexagonal boron nitride.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hexagonal Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite nanocrystals are prepared via a hot&#8208;injection method, and under cathodic potentials, are converted to Bi nanocrystals with the dual modification of I&#8722; and Cs+ on surface. The resultant catalyst exhibits great performances for CO2 reduction reaction to formate in both the H&#8208;cell and flow cell, and when used as the cathode catalyst for Al&#8208;CO2 batteries, enable simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.








Abstract
Bi&#8208;based materials are one of the most promising candidates for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate; however, the majority of them still suffer from low current density and stability that essentially constrain their potential applications at the industrial scale. Surface modification represents an effective approach to modulate the electrode microenvironment and the relative binding strength of key intermediates. Herein, it is&#160;demonstrated that the surface comodification with halides and alkali metal ions from the conversion of Bi&#8208;based halide perovskite nanocrystals is a viable strategy to boost the CO2RR performance of Bi for formate electrosynthesis. Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are prepared by a hot&#8208;injection method. The as&#8208;prepared products feature well&#8208;defined hexagonal shape and uniform size distribution. When used as the precatalyst, Cs3Bi2I9 nanocrystals are converted to Cs+ and I&#8722; comodified Bi. The resultant catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency close to 100%, and remarkable partial current density up to 44&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an H&#8208;cell and up to 276&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell. Moreover, Cs3Bi2I9 is used as the cathode catalyst and paired with an Al anode in an Al&#8208;CO2 battery for simultaneous CO2 valorization and power generation.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Phase&#8208;Transition Entropy into Electrochemical Thermopower and the Peltier Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is applied to the electrolyte of thermocell and electrochemical Peltier effect. By undergoing a coil&#8211;globule phase transition, the polymer exhibits a significant entropy change, resulting in a drastic increase in the Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the thermocell.








Abstract
A thermocell generates thermopower from a temperature difference (&#916;T) between two electrodes. The converse process of thermocells is an electrochemical Peltier effect, which creates a &#916;T on the electrodes by applying an external current. The Seebeck coefficient (Se) of the electrochemical system is proportional to the entropy change of the redox reaction; therefore, a redox system having a significant entropy change is expected to increase the Se. In this study, a thermoresponsive polymer having a redox&#8208;active moiety, poly(N&#8208;isopropyl acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;acrylamide ethyl)&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;n&#8208;propylviologen) (PNV), is used as the redox species of a thermocell. PNV2+ dication undergoes the coil&#8211;globule phase transition upon the reduction to PNV+ cation radical, and a large entropy change is introduced because water molecules are freed from the polymer chains. The Se of PNV thermocell drastically increased to +2.1&#160;mV K&#8722;1 at the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNV. The entropy change calculated from the increment of Se agrees with the value evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the electrochemical Peltier effect is observed when the device temperature is increased above the LCST. This study shows that the large entropy change associated with the coil&#8211;globule phase transition can be used in electrochemical thermal management and refrigeration technologies.

         <title>Biofilm Microenvironment&#8208;Responsive Self&#8208;Assembly Nanoreactors for All&#8208;Stage Biofilm Associated Infection through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;like Death and Macrophage Re&#8208;Rousing</title>

Biofilm microenvironment responsive self&#8208;assembly copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate nanoreactors are proposed for all&#8208;stage biofilm&#8208;associated infections through bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.








Abstract
Bacterial biofilm&#8208;associated infections (BAIs) are the leading cause of prosthetic implant failure. The dense biofilm structure prevents antibiotic penetration, while the highly acidic and H2O2&#8208;rich biofilm microenvironment (BME) dampens the immunological response of antimicrobial macrophages. Conventional treatments that fail to consistently suppress escaping planktonic bacteria from biofilm result in refractory recolonization, allowing BAIs to persist. Herein, a BME&#8208;responsive copper&#8208;doped polyoxometalate clusters (Cu&#8208;POM) combination with mild photothermal therapy (PTT) and macrophage immune re&#8208;rousing for BAI eradication at all stages is proposed. The self&#8208;assembly of Cu&#8208;POM in BME converts endogenous H2O2 to toxic &#183;OH through chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and generates a mild PTT effect to induce bacterial metabolic exuberance, resulting in loosening the membrane structure of the bacteria, enhancing copper transporter activity and increasing intracellular Cu&#8208;POM flux. Metabolomics reveals that intracellular Cu&#8208;POM overload restricts the TCA cycle and peroxide accumulation, promoting bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. CDT re&#8208;rousing macrophages scavenge planktonic bacteria escaping biofilm disintegration through enhanced chemotaxis and phagocytosis. Overall, BME&#8208;responsive Cu&#8208;POM promotes bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death via metabolic interference, while also re&#8208;rousing macrophage immune response for further planktonic bacteria elimination, resulting in all&#8208;stage BAI clearance and providing a new reference for future clinical application.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near&#8208;Zero Standby Power</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) fiber strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative gauge factor that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. This NRS fiber strain&#8208;sensor can be used to implement an ultralow&#8208;power healthcare monitoring system that transmits biological signals by only operating with an abnormally functioning body or when strain is applied.








Abstract
Recently, one of the primary concerns in e&#8208;textile&#8208;based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always&#8208;on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge&#8208;factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive&#8208;fiber&#8208;based negatively responsive switch&#8208;type (NRS) strain&#8208;sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet&#8208;irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain&#8208;sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E&#8208;fitness pants, smart&#8208;masks, and posture correction T&#8208;shirts) with near&#8208;zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain&#8208;sensors.

     alt="Strain-Driven Negative Resistance Switching of Conductive Fibers with Adjustable Sensitivity for Wearable Healthcare Monitoring Systems with Near-Zero Standby Power"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) fiber strain-sensor with an extremely high negative gauge factor that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. This NRS fiber strain-sensor can be used to implement an ultralow-power healthcare monitoring system that transmits biological signals by only operating with an abnormally functioning body or when strain is applied.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, one of the primary concerns in e-textile-based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always-on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio &#8776; 3.9&#160;&#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E-fitness pants, smart-masks, and posture correction T-shirts) with near-zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain-sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;responsive actuator with notable deformation, rapid response, and heavy workload is prepared via a swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. Its bending deformation under humidity change can be programmed to mimic the burrowing activities of earthworms, opening a new avenue to expand stimuli&#8208;responsive and degradable polymer materials in the areas associated with agricultural considerations.








Abstract
Natural earthworm with the ability to loosen soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired worldwide interest in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, a degradable actuator with the ability to deform in desired ways is presented, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamide via the swelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamide in moisture conditions causes rapid and remarkable bending. Such mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques. The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting rain diffusion as well as root breath.

         <title>Photocontrollable Elongation Actuation of Liquid Crystal Elastomer Films with Well&#8208;Defined Crease Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photocontrollable elongation actuation with large strain can be achieved in flexible polydomain liquid crystal elastomers by programing the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the weak actuation forces generated in the creases.








Abstract
Although liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have demonstrated various applications in artificial muscles and soft robotics, their inherent flexibility and orientation&#8208;dependent forces limit their functions. For instance, LCEs can sustain a high actuation force when they contract but cannot elongate to drive loads with large displacements. In this study, it is demonstrated that photocontrollable elongation actuation with a large strain can be achieved in polydomain LCEs by programming the crease structures in a well&#8208;defined order to couple the actuation forces. Efficient photoactuation without overheating&#8208;induced damage to the materials is favored, based on the well&#8208;designed photosensitive molecular switch crosslinker via the synergy of photochemical and photothermal effects. The LCE actuator can jack up heavy loads, elongate freely, and contract back to manipulate distant objects. Theoretical analysis based on a finite element simulation of the deformation energy during the actuation process reveals a trade&#8208;off between the abilities of jacking&#8208;up and withstanding load. More importantly, this study simplifies the design of a single material with functions inherent only in other soft robotic devices based on the assembly of multiple&#160;modules, thus providing a design strategy for surpassing instinctive properties of conventional soft materials to expand the functions of soft robotics.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;Stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;Alloy Acceptors Composed of a Hinge&#8208;Like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>

A hinge&#8208;like dimer acceptor DT19 is designed and synthesized as a special third component. This dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality in synergistically improving device efficiency and thermal stability of relevant host systems.








Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, is successfully designed and synthesized. It is incorporated as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrates a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintains a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#160;&#176;C for 200&#160;h. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibits excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperforms ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction kinetics of a perovskite oxide is significantly promoted by a facile metal&#8211;vacancy strategy. The newly developed vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite nanofibers exhibit comparable activities to the commercial Pt/C and even surpass it under low temperature. The developed catalyst can drive knittable fibrous&#8208;type and sandwich&#8208;type zinc&#8211;air batteries under low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with impressive performance.








Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8211;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics and enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8211;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Modulating Zinc Metal Reversibility by Confined Antifluctuator Film for Durable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefitting from the designed Zn anode antifluctuator that well integrates conductivity, buffering, mechanical strength, and anti&#8208;corrosion characteristics, the symmetric and full cell both deliver super&#8208;high cycling performance and enable the realization of the integration with electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device as artificial neural networks, and the integrated device achieves excellent linearity and handwritten digit recognition rate.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn ion batteries are promising systems due to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and non&#8208;toxicity, and the Zn corrosion and dendrite growth will cause the poor reversibility of Zn anode. Herein, the porous Zn@C solid, hollow, and yolk&#8211;shell microsphere films are developed as Zn anode antifluctuator (ZAAF). The prepared yolk&#8211;shell microspheres (Zn@C yolk&#8211;shell microsphere [ZCYSM]) film with superior buffering can effectively restrict the deposition of Zn metal in its interior and inhibit the volume expansion during plating/stripping process, thus modulating the Zn2+ flux and enabling stable Zn cycling. As a proof of concept, the ZCYSM@Zn symmetric cells achieve the excellent cyclic stability over 4000&#160;h and cumulative plated capacity of 4&#160;Ah cm&#8722;2&#160;at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Concomitantly, the suppressed corrosion reactions and dendrite&#8208;free ZAAF significantly improve the durability of full cells (coupled to CaV6O16&#183;3H2O). Additionally, durable pouch cell and electrochemical neuromorphic inorganic device (ENIDe) are integrated to simulate neural network, providing a strategy for extreme interconnectivity comparable to the human brain.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Anionic Structure Activated Co&#63743;S Bonds Promote Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity for High&#8208;Efficiency Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To investigate the bifunctional performance of hetero&#8208;anionic structure for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts are constructed and afford excellent catalytic performance in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The superior performance of the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#63743;S bond provides fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.








Abstract
The electronic structure of transition metal complexes can be modulated by replacing partial ion of complexes to obtain tuned intrinsic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity. However, the anion&#8208;modulated transition metal complexes ORR activity of is still unsatisfactory, and the construction of hetero&#8208;anionic structure remains challenging. Herein, an atomic doping strategy is presented to prepare the CuCo2O4&#8208;xSx/NC&#8208;2 (CCSO/NC&#8208;2) as electrocatalysts, the structrual characterization results favorably demonstrate the partial substitution of S atoms for O in CCSO/NC&#8208;2, which shows excellent catalytic performance and durability for OER and ORR in 0.1&#160;m KOH. In addition, the catalyst assembled Zinc&#8211;air battery with an open circuit potential of 1.43&#160;V maintains performance after 300&#160;h of cyclic stability. Theoretical calculations and differential charges illustrate that S doping optimizes the reaction kinetics and promotes electron redistribution. The superior performance of CCSO/NC&#8208;2 catalysis is mainly due to its unique S modulation of the electronic structure of the main body. The introduction of S promotes Co&#63743;O covalency and constructs a fast electron transport channel, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active site Co to the reaction intermediates.

Bandgap Modulation
In article number 2303198, Weida Hu, Zhuhua Zhang, Haomin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report effective bandgap modulation in zigzag&#8208;oriented hexagonal boron nitride nanoribbons (zBNNRs) via water adsorption. The water layer adsorbed along the edges is believed to create a huge transverse potential and then greatly reduces the bandgap. The conductance of &#8776;8 nm&#8208;wide zBNNRs can be tuned over 3 orders in magnitude via gating at room temperature.

Multifunctional Mechanical Metamaterials
The accordion can deliver a diverse range of melodies contingent upon the sequence of keys and bellows movement activated by the performer. In article number 2301109, Lei Wu and Damiano Pasini introduce a multifunctional mechanical metamaterial whose building block resembles the individual keys and bellows of an accordion. By activating the high&#8208;energy stable state of selected building blocks, the metamaterial can exhibit reprogrammable mechanical instabilities that can be engaged for accomplishing logical operations and tunable mechanical hysteresis in multifunctional devices.

Bioresins
Light&#8208;responsive microgels enable combination of embedded extrusion and volumetric bioprinting. In article number 2301673, Riccardo Levato and co&#8208;workers report the development of granular bioresins as a suspension bath for printing multiple cell types. Within seconds, the bath is shaped into complex 3D constructs with micro&#8208;to&#8208;macro, multiscale porosity, upon tomographic light exposure, building advanced models of cell&#8211;cell communication relevant for pancreatic metabolism.

Oxygen Electrocatalysis
To investigate the bifunctional performance of heterogeneous anionic structures for oxygen electrocatalysis, CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 catalysts, which exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the oxygen evolution/reduction reactions (OER/ORR), are designed by Ting Ouyang, Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2303488. The superior catalytic performance of CuCo2O4&#8722;xSx/NC&#8208;2 is attributed to the unique S modulation of the main body electronic structure, Co&#8211;S bonds&#8208;constructed fast electron&#8208;transport channels, thus optimizing the adsorption degree of active&#8208;site Co to the reaction intermediates.

Topologically Protected Structures
In article number 2303077, S. Joon Kwon, Dong Ki Yoon, and co&#8208;workers present a cutting&#8208;edge security system based on liquid crystal structures. These structures exhibit highly unpredictable pathways akin to the randomness observed in planar spin glasses. The cover image suggests that the randomness of cholesteric fingers and the erratic movements of people running freely in a maze are inherently unpredictable.

         <dc:description>
In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The basic concepts and components of liquid crystals and the functional materials derived from them are introduced. After that, their ongoing and foreseeable biomedical applications are discussed. 








Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. While liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to their biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields are summarized. The start is made by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shifting to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices are discussed. It is hoped that this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Enabling Future Closed&#8208;Loop Recycling of Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries: Direct Cathode Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct cathode regeneration methods are summarized to highlight the technical challenges, current status, supply chain, carbon footprints, and possible solutions for closed&#8208;loop battery recycling. The environmental, economic, and political benefits of the direct cathode regeneration methods are also considered, and a reference recycling route with available automated recycling technology is proposed and minimizes the costs.








Abstract
The rapid proliferation of electric vehicles equipped with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) presents serious waste management challenges and environmental hazards for recyclers after scrap. Closed&#8208;loop recycling contributes to the sustainable development of batteries and plays an important role in mitigating raw material shortages and supply chain risks. Herein, current direct cathode regeneration methods for industrialized recycling are outlined and evaluated. Different regeneration methods for spent cathode materials are summarized, which provide a new perspective for realizing closed&#8208;loop recycling of LIBs. A reference recycling route for retrofitting existing cathode production lines is proposed and minimizes the costs. In addition to promoting the industrialization of direct cathode recycling, the environmental, economic, and political benefits of battery recycling are also highlighted.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;Salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thanks to wide electrochemical stability window, water&#8208;in&#8208;salt electrolytes (WISEs) are attracting considerable interest. WISEs display distinctive physical and electrochemical properties compared to conventional electrolyte that makes them a promising electrolyte to be used in Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZnBs). This review provides overview about issues in ZnBs, a historical, basic, thermodynamic, and kinetic overview about WISEs and finally discusses their use in ZnBs.









Abstract
Zn&#8208;metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance of Zn, and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialization. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuate the HER. Consequently, the local pH around the Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0&#160;V vs standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. Here, an overview and discussion on this promising research direction for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs is provided. The review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs are detailed, with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, and ion transport at low temperature).

         <title>Material Design Strategies for Recovery of Critical Resources from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 36, September 7, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recovering critical resources from surface water, groundwater, and wastewater sources can offer a sustainable path toward securing their supply chains. This work reviews the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery.








Abstract
Population growth, urbanization, and decarbonization efforts are collectively straining the supply of limited resources that are necessary to produce batteries, electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, and other important products. Securing the supply chains of these critical resources via the development of separation technologies for their recovery represents a major global challenge to ensure stability and security. Surface water, groundwater, and wastewater are emerging as potential new sources to bolster these supply chains. Recently, a variety of material&#8208;based technologies have been developed and employed for separations and resource recovery in water. Judicious selection and design of these materials to tune their properties for targeting specific solutes is central to realizing the potential of water as a source for critical resources. Here, the materials that are developed for membranes, sorbents, catalysts, electrodes, and interfacial solar steam generators that demonstrate promise for applications in critical resource recovery are reviewed. In addition, a critical perspective is offered on the grand challenges and key research directions that need to be addressed to improve their practical viability.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Industrially&#8208;Relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni&#8208;N4 sites on curved carbon surfaces possess a lower energy barrier for *COOH formation, which benefits the CO2 reduction reaction. Accordingly, porous carbon with atomic Ni&#8208;N4 sites and a rich curved surface is developed and exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for CO formation under a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) are widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs; the effect of curved surfaces has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, theoretical calculations reveal that a single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on a curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. This work reports a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, a single Ni atom on a curved carbon surface is obtained and used as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. This work not only offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm 10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG) are developed as a boron nanocarrier for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Benefiting from the small particle size and high stealth efficiency, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles efficiently accumulate in CT26 tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1, resulting in significant tumor shrinkage by BNCT alone.








Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are 10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. Herein, the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT are reported. By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient 10B accumulation.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a novel approach to energy harvesting, storage, and on&#8208;demand release by integrating compressible gas within a multistable structure. An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into this &#8220;metafluid.&#8221; We&#160;examine its potential for energy harvesting from temperature fluctuations (such as day and night cycles), store the energy internally, and convert it into mechanical energy when needed.








Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8220;metafluids&#8221; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. The velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

         <title>Nonlinear Inflatable Actuators for Distributed Control in Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces conical shell actuators that display buckling instability when loaded with pressure. The critical peak&#8208; and valley&#8208;pressures are independently tunable through geometrical parameters. When these thresholds are carefully tuned for a system of actuators, a complex actuation sequence can be designed for, with only one input. This study demonstrates this by playing Beethoven on a piano.








Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation, and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, actuators are introduced with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. This dependency is mapped and used for creating a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, a system with six actuators is created that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Josephson Weak&#8208;Links in Monolayer WTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) can be both a quantum spin Hall insulator and gated into a superconducting state. Josephson weak&#8208;links are fabricated using local gates on hBN&#8208;encapsulated WTe2 and the 2D nature of the superconducting leads is demonstrated. The fabrication provides a first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one gate configurable topological Josephson weak&#8208;links.








Abstract
Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate&#8208;defined Josephson weak&#8208;link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one topological Josephson weak&#8208;links using monolayer WTe2.

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8211;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotors precisely approach target neural stem cells (NSCs) under magnetic guidance and further activate the cellular voltage&#8208;gated ion channel, thus directing the differentiation fate of the target cell. Such micromotors provide a possibility for non&#8208;invasive, minimally invasive therapy for neuron regeneration.








Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8211;chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric&#8211;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. It is shown that allowing buckling of the primary load path can be used to set an upper limit for vibration transmission. In free&#8208;standing mechanical metamaterials, this principle is used to generate extreme vibration damping with very high stiffness, far exceeding typical values for lightweight structural materials.








Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. Herein, a new method for passive vibration damping, by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, is introduced, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted&#160;acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This principle is demonstrated experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. It is also shown that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling&#8208;based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bidirectional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way toward extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and, as such, could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles, and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>A Gas/phototheranostic Nanocomposite Integrates NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Peak Absorbing Aza&#8208;BODIPY with Thermal&#8208;Sensitive Nitric Oxide Donor for Atraumatic Osteosarcoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY), combining with a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimizes the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep&#8208;tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature, Reversible, and Robust Thermochromic Fluorescence Based on Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature&#8208;driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.








Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

         <title>Paintable Physical Unclonable Functions using DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA liquid crystals (LCs), which are extracted from nature, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, are used as a paint for anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The entropy&#8208;driven instability in the evaporation process of DNA LCs induces a stochastic birefringent pattern that provides high&#8208;level security codes based on physical unclonable functions. The platform can allow the fabrication&#160;of protective barriers with a simple method, brushstrokes.








Abstract
Controversy over artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but these are still open to piracy. Here, a platform is proposed for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is natural, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of the PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>An Artificial Olfactory System Based on a Chemi&#8208;Memristive Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hysteretic chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor containing TiO2&#8208;nanorod memristors based on oxygen vacancy dynamics different from that of conventional sensors is developed. Analog conductance modulation based on the redox reaction with external gas molecules in a ruptured filament area after memristive switching converts external gas stimuli into synaptic weights to realize an artificial olfactory system.








Abstract
Technologies based on the fusion of gas sensors and neuromorphic computing to mimic the olfactory system have immense potential. However, the implementation of neuromorphic olfactory systems remains in a state of infancy because conventional gas sensors lack the necessary functions. Therefore, this study proposes a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. After the memristive switching operation, the redox reaction with the external gas molecules is enhanced, resulting in the generation and elimination of oxygen vacancies that induce rapid current changes. In addition, the pre&#8208;generated oxygen vacancies enhance the post&#8208;sensing properties. Therefore, fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response are achieved by the proposed sensor at room temperature. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated as a potential application. Moreover, analog conductance modulation induced by oxidizing and reducing gases enables the conversion of external gas stimuli into synaptic weights and hence the realization of typical synaptic functionalities without an additional device or circuit. The proposed chemi&#8208;memristive device represents an advance in the bioinspired technology adopted in creating artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded method is developed to prepare hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2, based on rational modulation of phase and morphology. The obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles with modified electronic structure, high intrinsic activity, and abundant active sites exhibit excellent catalytic performances toward electrochemical glycerol oxidation, outperforming hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 and solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles.








Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potential as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, that is, orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#63743;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. This work can pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of reinforcement of polymer materials by graphene&#8208;based inclusions is highly important for the design of high&#8208;performance composites. Very large molecular simulations show that single graphene layers can effectively reinforce the polymer matrix via a shear&#8208;lag process down to flake sizes of 500 nm, as long as the flake is predominantly flat. However, even small undulations of the surface substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.








Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics, the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites are &#160;examined. Simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free, and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical lengths for enhancement are approximately 500 nm for graphene and 300 nm and for graphene oxide (GO). The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Polyimides Physically Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost breakdown strength and trap charge carriers to suppress dielectric loss. An ultrahigh Ud of 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and superior cyclic stability at 200&#160;&#176;C are achieved in the all&#8208;organic composites.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications, such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. In this work, 3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb, and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. This study demonstrates that this strategy is well applicable to a number of representative aromatic polyimides, and ultrahigh Ud of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries Featuring Single Molybdenum Atoms in a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <title>An Ultrafast, Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrochromic and Thermochromic Device for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through innovative molecular design and advanced device optimization, a high&#8208;performance electrochromic device is achieved, demonstrating high transparency, rapid color&#8208;switching, and excellent stability. In conjunction with the creation of a thermoresponsive gel electrolyte, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is realized, exhibiting flame&#8208;retardant properties and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Such an advanced device equips smart windows with energy efficiency, privacy protection, and decorative enhancements.








Abstract
Smart windows nowadays undertake the esteemed obligation of reducing energy consumption as well as upgrading living experience. This project aims to devise a smart window that responds to both electricity and heat, with the intention of achieving energy efficiency, privacy preservation, and enhanced decorative attributes. Through the implementation of a novel electrochromic material design, coupled with the optimization of electrochromic devices (ECDs), a high&#8208;performance ECD is obtained, demonstrating coloring/bleaching time of 0.53/0.16&#160;s, a transmittance modulation of 78% (from 99% to 21%), and superior performance in six dimensions. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;responsive units and an ionic liquid are incorporated into the electrolyte system to create a novel thermochromic gel electrolyte with transmittance modulation from 80% to 0%, and excellent thermal insulation (6.4&#160;&#176;C reduction). Ultimately, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is developed, featuring an ultrafast color&#8208;switching speed of 0.82/0.60&#160;s and multiple working modes. Overall, this work showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of next&#8208;generation ultrafast&#8208;switching, and energy&#8208;efficient intelligent windows.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;related defects with unpaired electrons are constructed in carbon dots via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, which not only contribute to the enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to noninvasive NIR fluorescent imaging and effective photocatalytic therapy.








Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

         <title>Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU&#8208;TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the asymmetric structural features and functions of finger skin, an innovative PU&#8208;TA@MXene sensing film with bionic Janus architecture is proposed by a simple but ingenious gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, and the derived flexible sensor reveals strong mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and well&#8208;selective response behavior to normal pressure, stretching, and directional bending.








Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra&#8208;derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties, and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems have not been fully clarified. In this work, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate heteroepitaxy is demonstrated and it is shown that the lattice matched plane of the adcrystal must also be its lowest energy surface.








Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, it is found that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. It is found that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy over a large area. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) with berberine (BBR) cores with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed for different binding, localization, and photodynamic killing effects among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility.








Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad applications potential in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites are more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed and synthesized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT . Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs are achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It is found that intracellular active substances, not membranes, are more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain mimicking model is designed with photosensitive neural spheroid and neural network. In the photosensitive neural spheroid, human opins such as rhodopsin and short&#8208;wavelength opsin are reacted by the specific wavelength of light with selective sensitivity. Photonic reaction result in the neural response, of which signal spread to other neurons through axons.








Abstract
An&#160;in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength human opsins and rhodopsins, is created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids are transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These are employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body is transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid is monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted post&#8208;modification strategy is developed to anchor dozen kinds of metal ions into metal&#8211;organic framework composites as structurally ordered metal promoters, which not only contributes to constructing ideal catalyst models for elucidating action mechanism of metal promoters during the catalytic process, but also provides a universal method to synthesize high&#8208;efficiency catalysts.








Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, a new function of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed as an ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL&#8208;3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.








Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3&#160;and PD&#8208;1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single&#8208;cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

         <title>Strong Magnetically&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation in Ultrarobust Mn(II)&#8211;Organic Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrarobust helical Mn(II)&#8208;organic polymers are developed to realize magnetically&#8208;responsive circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with exceptionally high performance (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;89%, glum&#160;=&#160;0.021) as well as triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity.&#160;We&#160;have disclosed that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPP for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPP signal noticeably.








Abstract
Over recent years, Mn(II)&#8208;organic materials showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great interest because of their eco&#8208;friendliness, cheapness, and room temperature phosphorescence. Using the helicity design strategy, herein, chiral Mn(II)&#8208;organic helical polymers are constructed featuring long&#8208;lived circularly polarized phosphorescence with exceptionally high glum and &#934;PL magnitudes of 0.021% and 89%, respectively, while remaining ultrarobust toward humidity, temperature, and X&#8208;rays. Equally important, it is disclosed for the first time that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPL for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPL signal by 4.2&#8208;times at B&#8407;$\vec{B}$&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;T. Using the designed materials, UV&#8208;pumped CPL light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, demonstrating enhanced optical selectivity under right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed polarization conditions. On top of all this, the reported materials display bright triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity with a perfectly linear X&#8208;ray dose rate response up to 174&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, these observations significantly contribute to the CPL phenomenon for multi&#8208;spin compounds and promote the design of highly efficient and stable Mn(II)&#8208;based CPL emitters.

         <title>Sequential Molecule&#8208;Doped Hole Conductor to Achieve &gt;23% Perovskite Solar Cells with 3000&#8208;Hour Operational Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
Application of solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport layers (HTLs) is being held back by poor stability and unsatisfied scalability. Herein, a versatile molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping approach is developed to improve the spatial doping uniformity and fabricate all&#8208;evaporated HTL. The resultant devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.4%, and exhibit impressive stability both in ambient and working conditions.








Abstract
Although hole transport layers (HTLs) based on solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD are extremely popular and effective for their remarkable performance in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their scalable application is still being held back by poor chemical stability and unsatisfied scalability. Essentially, the volatile components and hygroscopic nature of ionic salts often cause morphological deformation that deteriorate both device efficiency and stability. Herein, a simple and effective molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping (MISD) approach is strategically introduced to modulate spatial doping uniformity of organic films and fabricate all evaporated Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD layer in which phase&#8208;segregation free HTL is achieved accompanied with high molecular density, uniform doping composition, and superior optoelectronic characteristics. The resultant MISD&#8208;based devices attain a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4%, which represents the highest reported value among all the PSCs with evaporated HTLs. Simultaneously, the unencapsulated devices realize considerably enhanced stability by maintaining over 90% of their initial PCEs in the air for 5200&#160;h and after working at maximum power point under illumination for 3000&#160;h. This method provides a facile way to fabricate robust and reliable HTLs toward developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanoplatforms are designed by fusing M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles with drug&#8208;loaded liposomes and decorating them with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, which enables amplified CD47 blockade&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy through combinational treatment strategy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into the &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, it is reported that hybrid nanovesicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820, and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non&#8208;ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline LixFePO4 are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li+, excess electrons, Li+ vacancies, electron holes; C&#948; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).








Abstract
One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point&#8208;defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.

     alt="How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two-Sided Approach"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non-ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline Li&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, excess electrons, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; vacancies, electron holes; &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point-defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end-member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in-between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise time of transient photovoltage measurements on halide perovskite solar cells is used to quantify charge extraction. As the decay time of the photovoltage can be used to quantify recombination, the combination of rise and decay provides a complete analysis of recombination and extraction and its impact on photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. Herein, a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that are solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage are determined, and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium cobalt oxide substrate provides active sites for the dissociation of water, and the generated H intermediates recombine to generate H2 on the Ru single atoms or clusters. Comparing the two kinds of Ru sites, Ru cluster dominates the alkaline HER activity due to the more fluent migration of H intermediates and its more favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption energetics toward H intermediates.








Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) are demonstrated as a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst demonstrates an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8211;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

         <title>A Multifunctional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate performs three functions on perovskites: dimensionality control, defect passivation, and surface modification. Consequently, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 11.87% at 468&#160;nm, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLEDs), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465&#8211;475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA2Csn&#8722;1Pbn(Br0.55Cl0.45)3n+1 polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#63743;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8211;Ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanodomain strategy for improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials simultaneously is presented. Ag2Te with suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and improved strength&#8211;ductility synergy is achieved. These findings provide new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical strength&#8211;ductility synergy.








Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

Active Metamaterials
In article number 2303541, Ruike Renee Zhao and co&#8208;workers present a novel magneto&#8208;mechanical metamaterial that employs a double&#8208;layer design to change area density while preserving the overall area for good conformability during actuation. Magnetic actuation facilitates rapid and reversible structural deformation between multiple modes. This allows for the metamaterial to control the propagation of in&#8208;plane elastic waves of different frequencies.

Physical Unclonable Functions
In article number 2302135, Dong Ki Yoon and co&#8208;workers present a framework for the creation of physical unclonable function (PUF)&#8208;based authentication labels using DNA. The platform leverages the inherent stochastic birefringent pattern that emerges through the entropy&#8208;driven instability during the drying process of aqueous DNA solutions. By harnessing the disclinations within the DNA film, secure security codes are generated, exhibiting a level of randomness that ensures robust high&#8208;level security measures.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2302219, Suk Yeop Chun, Young Geun Song, Chong&#8208;Yun Kang, Jung Ho Yoon, and co&#8208;workers propose a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen&#8208;vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, including fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
In article number 2300308, Natalie Banerji and co&#8208;workers present an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based on a conjugated polymer film. Switching on the transistor leads to oxidation of the polymer, forming polarons and bipolarons. The charges are compensated by ions that enter the film from the electrolyte. Using time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, they show that polarons prefer the ordered regions of the film, while bipolarons are generated in the amorphous regions.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms, the rational regulations for various single atom catalysts (SACs) to improve their bifunctional activity and stability, and the challenges and future perspectives of bifunctional SACs for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;air batteries are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability, and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.
