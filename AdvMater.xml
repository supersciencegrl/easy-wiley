      <title>Metal Atom&#8208;Doped Co3O4 Hierarchical Nanoplates for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
Metal atom&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical nanoplates constructed by ultrathin nanosheets are synthesized by a cooperative etching&#8722;coordination&#8722;reorganization approach. The method allows doping of 13 metal elements in total. With the structural and compositional advantages, as an example, the Fe&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical nanoplates exhibit greatly enhanced electrocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts based on hierarchically structured and heteroatom&#8208;doped non&#8208;noble metal oxide materials are of great importance for efficient and low&#8208;cost electrochemical water splitting systems. Herein, the synthesis of a series of hierarchical hollow nanoplates (NPs) composed of ultrathin Co3O4 nanosheets doped with 13 different metal atoms is reported. The synthesis involves a cooperative etching&#8722;coordination&#8722;reorganization approach starting from zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) NPs. First, metal atom decorated ZIF&#8208;67 NPs with unique cross&#8208;channels are formed through a Lewis acid etching and metal species coordination process. Afterward, the composite NPs are converted to hollow Co3O4 hierarchical NPs composed of ultrathin nanosheets through a solvothermal reaction, during which the guest metal species is doped into the octahedral sites of Co3O4. Density functional theory calculations suggest that doping of small amount of Fe atoms near the surface of Co3O4 can greatly enhance the electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the structural and compositional advantages, the obtained Fe&#8208;doped Co3O4 hierarchical NPs manifest superior electrocatalytic performance for OER with an overpotential of 262 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 43 mV dec&#8722;1, and excellent stability even at a high current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for 50 h.

      <title>Robust Fabrication of Hybrid Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Pellets for Stable X&#8208;Ray Detectors with Low Detection Limit</title>
      <dc:description>
MA3Bi2I9 polycrystalline pellets (PPs) are fabricated by the robust, cost effective, and scalable cold isostatic&#8208;pressing approach, and X&#8208;ray detectors based on MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs reach a limit of detection (LoD) of 9.3 nGyair s&#8722;1. The low LoD of the X&#8208;ray detectors can obviously decrease the radiation dose used, thereby reducing health risks in medical diagnostics and security screening.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray detectors are widely utilized in medical diagnostics and nondestructive product inspection. Halide perovskites are recently demonstrated as excellent candidates for direct X&#8208;ray detection. However, it is still challenging to obtain high quality perovskites with millimeter&#8208;thick over a large area for high performance, stable X&#8208;ray detectors. Here, methylammonium bismuth iodide (MA3Bi2I9) polycrystalline pellets (PPs) are developed by a robust, cost effective, and scalable cold isostatic&#8208;pressing for fabricating X&#8208;ray detectors with low limit of detection (LoD) and superior operational stability. The MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs possess a high resistivity of 2.28 &#215; 1011 &#937; cm and low dark carrier concentration of &#8776;107 cm&#8722;3, and balanced mobility of &#8776;2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for electrons and holes. These merits enable a sensitivity of 563 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, a detection efficiency of 28.8%, and an LoD of 9.3 nGyair s&#8722;1 for MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs detectors, and the LoD is much lower than the dose rate required for X&#8208;ray diagnostics used currently (5.5 &#956;Gyair s&#8722;1). In addition, the MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs detectors work stably under high working bias field up to 2000 V cm&#8722;1 after sensing an integrated dose &gt;320 Gyair with continuous X&#8208;ray radiation, demonstrating its competitive advantage in practical application. These findings provide an approach to explore a new generation of low LoD, stable and green X&#8208;ray detectors based on MA3Bi2I9&#8208;PPs.

      <title>Perovskite Granular Wire Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Photodetectivity</title>
      <dc:description>
Perovskite granular wires synthesized by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly exhibit superior photodetecting performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity, originating from a low dark current due to band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires. The &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.








Abstract
Control over the morphology and crystallinity of metal halide perovskite materials is of key importance to enable high&#8208;performance optoelectronics. Here, a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly synthesis of perovskite granular wires with ultrahigh photodetectivity (3.17 &#215; 1015 Jones) is reported. The 1D self&#8208;assembly of perovskite grains is driven by differences in the surface interaction energies of the granular facets. The superb photodetecting performance originates from extremely low dark current engendered by energetic barriers featuring unique band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of wire. Flexible photodetector arrays, fabricated by selectively placing perovskite granular wires onto pre&#8208;patterned electrode arrays on a transparent polymer substrate, show independently addressable photonic signal mapping with remarkably high detectivity, photoconductive gain, and responsivity. The &#8220;self&#8208;assembled nanograin engineering&#8221; strategy developed in this study provides a viable method for the development of high&#8208;performance perovskite photodetectors and can be extended to other integrated optoelectronic systems.

      <title>Nonvolatile Electrically Reconfigurable Integrated Photonic Switch Enabled by a Silicon PIN Diode Heater</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonvolatile electrically reconfigurable photonic switches based on phase&#8208;change material&#8208;clad silicon waveguides and microring resonators are demonstrated via in situ silicon PIN diode heaters. Low&#8208;energy, compact, low&#8208;loss, low&#8208;voltage, and high&#8208;cyclability operations at moderate speeds are obtained in a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;compatible process, promising very large&#8208;scale programmable electronic&#8211;photonic systems such as optical neural networks and general&#8208;purpose integrated photonic processors.








Abstract
Reconfigurability of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) has become increasingly important due to the growing demands for electronic&#8211;photonic systems on a chip driven by emerging applications, including neuromorphic computing, quantum information, and microwave photonics. Success in these fields usually requires highly scalable photonic switching units as essential building blocks. Current photonic switches, however, mainly rely on materials with weak, volatile thermo&#8208;optic or electro&#8208;optic modulation effects, resulting in large footprints and high energy consumption. As a promising alternative, chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) exhibit strong optical modulation in a static, self&#8208;holding fashion, but the scalability of present PCM&#8208;integrated photonic applications is still limited by the poor optical or electrical actuation approaches. Here, with phase transitions actuated by in situ silicon PIN diode heaters, scalable nonvolatile electrically reconfigurable photonic switches using PCM&#8208;clad silicon waveguides and microring resonators are demonstrated. As a result, intrinsically compact and energy&#8208;efficient switching units operated with low driving voltages, near&#8208;zero additional loss, and reversible switching with high endurance are obtained in a complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible process. This work can potentially enable very large&#8208;scale CMOS&#8208;integrated programmable electronic&#8211;photonic systems such as optical neural networks and general&#8208;purpose integrated photonic processors.

      <title>Boosting Neutral Water Oxidation through Surface Oxygen Modulation</title>
      <dc:description>
A novel design of efficient neutral oxygen evolution reaction catalyst is demonstrated by incorporating hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) into Ru&#8211;Ir binary oxide. The obtained Ru&#8211;Ir&#8211;Ca oxide catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, and its turnover frequency is about 2&#8208;, 7&#8208;, and 45&#8208;times higher than those of Ru&#8211;Ir oxide, RuO2, and IrO2 catalysts, respectively.








Abstract
Developing efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in pH&#8208;neutral electrolyte is crucial for microbial electrolysis cells and electrochemical CO2 reduction. Unfortunately, the OER kinetics in neutral electrolyte is sluggish due to the low concentration of adsorbed reactants, with overpotentials of neutral OER at present much higher than that in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. Here, hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) are sought to be incorporated into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ru&#8211;Ir binary oxide to tailor the surface oxygen environments (lattice&#8208;oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species) for efficient neutral OER. Using a sol&#8211;gel method, ternary Ru&#8211;Ir&#8211;Ca oxides are synthesized in atomically homogenous manner, and the obtained catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, with no degradation for 200 h of operation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and 18O isotope&#8208;labeling secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies are carried out. The results reveal that incorporation of Ca2+ can enhance the covalency of metal&#8211;oxygen bonds and the electrophilic nature of surface metal&#8208;bonded oxygen sites; and simultaneously facilitate the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst surface, which accelerates the lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;involved reaction, thus improving the overall OER performance of RuIrCaOx catalyst.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance and Reliable Lead&#8208;Free Layered&#8208;Perovskite Transistors</title>
      <dc:description>
Universal approaches for high&#8208;performance and reliable p&#8208;channel lead&#8208;free phenethylammonium tin iodide perovskite&#8208;based transistors are developed, including self&#8208;passivation for grain boundary by excess phenethylammonium iodide, crystallization control by adduct, and iodide vacancy passivation through oxygen treatment. The first complementary inverter is also demonstrated combined with n&#8208;channel indium gallium zinc oxide transistors.








Abstract
Perovskites have been intensively investigated for their use in solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, research on their applications in thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) has drawn less attention despite their high intrinsic charge carrier mobility. In this study, the universal approaches for high&#8208;performance and reliable p&#8208;channel lead&#8208;free phenethylammonium tin iodide TFTs are reported. These include self&#8208;passivation for grain boundary by excess phenethylammonium iodide, grain crystallization control by adduct, and iodide vacancy passivation through oxygen treatment. It is found that the grain boundary passivation can increase TFT reproducibility and reliability, and the grain size enlargement can hike the TFT performance, thus, enabling the first perovskite&#8208;based complementary inverter demonstration with n&#8208;channel indium gallium zinc oxide TFTs. The inverter exhibits a high gain over 30 with an excellent noise margin. This work aims to provide widely applicable and repeatable methods to make the gate more open for intensive efforts toward high&#8208;performance printed perovskite TFTs.

      <title>Controlling Enamel Remineralization by Amyloid&#8208;Like Amelogenin Mimics</title>
      <dc:description>
The amyloid&#8208;like proteinaceous nanofilm entrapping peptide can mimic amelogenin matrix in nature, mediating the oriented array of amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles and their transformation to ordered enamel&#8208;like hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals. This technology can reproduce the growth of ordered HAp crystals, with the nearly identical mechanical strength to natural enamel, thus providing a promising strategy for treating dental caries.








Abstract
In situ regeneration of the enamel&#8208;like structure of hydroxyapatite (HAp) crystals under oral conditions is significant for dental caries treatment. However, it is still a challenge for dentists to duplicate the elegant and well&#8208;aligned apatite structure bonding to the surface of demineralized enamel. A biocompatible amelogenin&#8208;inspired matrix, a phasetransited lysozyme (PTL) film mimicking an N&#8208;terminal amelogenin with central domain (N&#8208;Ame) combined with synthetic peptide (C&#8208;AMG) based on the functional domains of C&#8208;terminal telopeptide (C&#8208;Ame) is shown here, which is formed by amyloid&#8208;like lysozyme aggregation at the enamel interface through a rapid one&#8208;step aqueous coating process. In the PTL/C&#8208;AMG matrix, C&#8208;AMG facilitated the oriented arrangement of amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles and their transformation to ordered enamel&#8208;like HAp crystals, while PTL served as a strong interfacial anchor to immobilize the C&#8208;AMG peptide and PTL/C&#8208;AMG matrix on versatile substrate surfaces. PTL/C&#8208;AMG film&#8208;coated enamel induced both of the in vivo and in vitro synthesis of HAp crystals, facilitated epitaxial growth of HAp crystals and recovered the highly oriented structure and mechanical properties to levels nearly identical to those of natural enamel. This work underlines the importance of amyloid&#8208;like protein aggregates in the biomineralization of enamel, providing a promising strategy for treating dental caries.

      <title>Self&#8208;Repairing Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells with a Breakthrough Efficiency Over 11%</title>
      <dc:description>
Phenylhydrazine hydrochloride is introduced into FASnI3 (FA = NH2CH = NH2+)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells in order to reduce the existing Sn4+ and prevent the further degradation of FASnI3. Consequently, the champion device shows a high power conversion efficiency up to 11.4%, a long&#8208;term storage stability over 2300 h, and an efficiency recovery capability after being exposed to air.








Abstract
The development of tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is hindered by their lower power conversion efficiency and poorer stability compared to the lead&#8208;based ones, which arise from the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+. Herein, phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) is introduced into FASnI3 (FA = NH2CH = NH2+) perovskite films to reduce the existing Sn4+ and prevent the further degradation of FASnI3, since PHCl has a reductive hydrazino group and a hydrophobic phenyl group. Consequently, the device achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 11.4% for lead&#8208;free PSCs. Besides, the unencapsulated device displays almost no efficiency reduction in a glove box over 110 days and shows efficiency recovery after being exposed to air, due to a proposed self&#8208;repairing trap state passivation process.

&lt;p&gt;The development of tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is hindered by their lower power conversion efficiency and poorer stability compared to the lead&#8208;based ones, which arise from the easy oxidation of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;. Herein, phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (PHCl) is introduced into FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA = NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH = NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) perovskite films to reduce the existing Sn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and prevent the further degradation of FASnI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, since PHCl has a reductive hydrazino group and a hydrophobic phenyl group. Consequently, the device achieves a record power conversion efficiency of 11.4% for lead&#8208;free PSCs. Besides, the unencapsulated device displays almost no efficiency reduction in a glove box over 110 days and shows efficiency recovery after being exposed to air, due to a proposed self&#8208;repairing trap state passivation process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stable and Biocompatible Carbon Nanotube Ink Mediated by Silk Protein for Printed Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
A highly stable and biocompatible conductive ink is developed based on carbon nanotubes and natural silk sericin. Owing to its high electrical conductivity, high colloidal stability, and good biocompatibility, this ink holds great potential in flexible and wearable electronics.








Abstract
Ink&#8208;based processes, which enable scalable fabrication of flexible devices based on nanomaterials, are one of the practical approaches for the production of wearable electronics. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which possess great potential for flexible electronics, are facing challenges for use in inks due to their low dispersity in most solvents and suspicious cytotoxicity. Here, a stable and biocompatible CNT ink, which is stabilized by sustainable silk sericin and free from any artificial chemicals, is reported. The ink shows stability up to months, which can be attributed to the formation of sericin&#8211;CNT (SSCNT) hybrid through non&#8208;covalent interactions. It is demonstrated that the SSCNT ink can be used for fabricating versatile circuits on textile, paper, and plastic films through various techniques. As proofs of concept, electrocardiogram electrodes, breath sensors, and electrochemical sensors for monitoring human health and activity are fabricated, demonstrating the great potential of the SSCNT ink for smart wearables.

      <title>Unveiling the Fine Structural Distortion of Atomically Thin Bi2O2Se by Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation</title>
      <dc:description>
Unveiling fine structural distortions, especially the oxygen rotation/tilt, is important to in&#8208;depth understanding of the physical properties of complex oxides. However, most available techniques are either time consuming or requiring tedious sample treatment. This work reports a noninvasive and highly&#8208;sensitive method based on third&#8208;harmonic generation to successfully reveal the oxygen square rotation &lt;1.4&#176; in 2D centrosymmetric Bi2O2Se.








Abstract
Bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se), a new type of 2D material, has recently attracted increased attention due to its robust bandgap, stability under ambient conditions, and ultrahigh electron mobility. In such complex oxides, fine structural distortion tends to play a decisive role in determining the unique physical properties, such as the ferrorotational order, ferroelectricity, and magnetoelasticity. Therefore, an in&#8208;depth investigation of the fine structural symmetry of Bi2O2Se is necessary to exploit its potential applications. However, conventional techniques are either time consuming or requiring tedious sample treatment. Herein, a noninvasive and high&#8208;throughput approach is reported for characterizing the fine structural distortion in 2D centrosymmetric Bi2O2Se by polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG). Unprecedentedly, the divergence between the experimental results and the theoretical prediction of the perpendicular component of polarization&#8208;dependent THG indicates a fine structural distortion, namely, a &lt;1.4&#176; rotation of the oxygen square in the tetragonal (Bi2O2) layers. This rotation breaks the intrinsic mirror symmetry of 2D Bi2O2Se, eventually reducing the symmetry from the D4h to the C4h point group. The results demonstrate that THG is highly sensitive to even fine symmetry variations, thereby showing its potential to uncover hidden phase transitions and interacting polarized sublattices in novel 2D material systems.

      <title>Crystallization in Confinement</title>
      <dc:description>
The influence of confinement on crystallization processes, where effects on features including the crystal polymorph, morphology, and orientation are observed in environments with different length scales and geometries, is described. Understanding this phenomenon will therefore enable confinement to be used to control crystallization in multiple applications and to provide superior insight into crystallization in many real&#8208;world environments.








Abstract
Many crystallization processes of great importance, including frost heave, biomineralization, the synthesis of nanomaterials, and scale formation, occur in small volumes rather than bulk solution. Here, the influence of confinement on crystallization processes is described, drawing together information from fields as diverse as bioinspired mineralization, templating, pharmaceuticals, colloidal crystallization, and geochemistry. Experiments are principally conducted within confining systems that offer well&#8208;defined environments, varying from droplets in microfluidic devices, to cylindrical pores in filtration membranes, to nanoporous glasses and carbon nanotubes. Dramatic effects are observed, including a stabilization of metastable polymorphs, a depression of freezing points, and the formation of crystals with preferred orientations, modified morphologies, and even structures not seen in bulk. Confinement is also shown to influence crystallization processes over length scales ranging from the atomic to hundreds of micrometers, and to originate from a wide range of mechanisms. The development of an enhanced understanding of the influence of confinement on crystal nucleation and growth will not only provide superior insight into crystallization processes in many real&#8208;world environments, but will also enable this phenomenon to be used to control crystallization in applications including nanomaterial synthesis, heavy metal remediation, and the prevention of weathering.

      <title>Fiber&#8208;Reinforced Viscoelastomers Show Extraordinary Crack Resistance That Exceeds Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel soft fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (FRPs) are developed by using viscoelastic polymers that are adhesive, soft, and tough as matrices. The unique combination of these properties in the matrices ensures a strong component interface, which consequently maximizes the energy dissipation density and gives rise to a large force transfer length enabled by the extremely high fiber/matrix modulus ratio. As a result, the soft FRPs can achieve toughness of up to 2500 kJ m&#8722;2, exceeding any existing best&#8208;in&#8208;class materials.








Abstract
Soft fiber&#8208;reinforced polymers (FRPs), consisting of rubbery matrices and rigid fabrics, are widely utilized in industry because they possess high specific strength in tension while allowing flexural deformation under bending or twisting. Nevertheless, existing soft FRPs are relatively weak against crack propagation due to interfacial delamination, which substantially increases their risk of failure during use. In this work, a class of soft FRPs that possess high specific strength while simultaneously showing extraordinary crack resistance are developed. The strategy is to synthesize tough viscoelastic matrices from acrylate monomers in the presence of woven fabrics, which generates soft composites with a strong interface and interlocking structure. Such composites exhibit fracture energy, &#915;, of up to 2500 kJ m&#8722;2, exceeding the toughest existing materials. Experimental elucidation shows that the fracture energy obeys a simple relation, &#915; = W &#183; lT, where W is the volume&#8208;weighted average of work of extension at fracture of the two components and lT is the force transfer length that scales with the square root of fiber/matrix modulus ratio. Superior &#915; is achieved through a combination of extraordinarily large lT (10&#8211;100 mm), resulting from the extremely high fiber/matrix modulus ratios (104&#8211;105), and the maximized energy dissipation density, W. The elucidated quantitative relationship provides guidance toward the design of extremely tough soft composites.

      <title>Interfacial Molecular Doping of Metal Halide Perovskites for Highly Efficient Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A small molecule of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8242;&#8243;&#8208;(pyrazine&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrayl) tetrakis (N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) aniline) (PT&#8208;TPA) is applied to effectively p&#8208;dope the FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 (FA:HC(NH2)2; MA:CH3NH3) perovskite surface, with obvious conductivity and carrier concentration increase. After applying PT&#8208;TPA into perovskite solar cells, the doping&#8208;induced band bending at perovskite surface facilitates hole extraction to hole transport layer and expels electrons toward cathode, which reduces the surface charge recombination. The optimized devices demonstrate a stabilized efficiency of 22.9%.








Abstract
Tailoring the doping of semiconductors in heterojunction solar cells shows tremendous success in enhancing the performance of many types of inorganic solar cells, while it is found challenging in perovskite solar cells because of the difficulty in doping perovskites in a controllable way. Here, a small molecule of 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;,4&#8243;&#8242;&#8208;(pyrazine&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrayl) tetrakis (N,N&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methoxyphenyl) aniline) (PT&#8208;TPA) which can effectively p&#8208;dope the surface of FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 (FA: HC(NH2)2; MA: CH3NH3) perovskite films is reported. The intermolecular charge transfer property of PT&#8208;TPA forms a stabilized resonance structure to accept electrons from perovskites. The doping effect increases perovskite dark conductivity and carrier concentration by up to 4737 times. Computation shows that electrons in the first two layers of octahedral cages in perovskites are transferred to PT&#8208;TPA. After applying PT&#8208;TPA into perovskite solar cells, the doping&#8208;induced band bending in perovskite effectively facilitates hole extraction to hole transport layer and expels electrons toward cathode side, which reduces the charge recombination there. The optimized devices demonstrate an increased photovoltage from 1.12 to 1.17 V and an efficiency of 23.4% from photocurrent scanning with a stabilized efficiency of 22.9%. The findings demonstrate that molecular doping is an effective route to control the interfacial charge recombination in perovskite solar cells which is in complimentary to broadly applied defect passivation techniques.

      <title>Consolidating Lithiothermic&#8208;Ready Transition Metals for Li2S&#8208;Based Cathodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A series of Li2S/transition metal nanocomposites is synthesized by lithiothermic reduction reaction. On one hand, incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity, decreased activation potential, and inhibited polysulfide dissolution of Li2S. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li2S into prelithiation agents.








Abstract
Li2S holds a promising role as a high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;containing cathode, circumventing use of metallic lithium in constructing next&#8208;generation batteries to replace current Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, progress of Li2S cathode has been plagued by its intrinsic drawbacks, including high activation potentials, poor rate performance, and rapid capacity fading during long cycling. Herein, a series of Li2S/transition metal (TM) nanocomposites are synthesized via a lithiothermic reduction reaction, and it is realized that the presence of TMs in Li2S matrix can transform electrochemical behaviors of Li2S. On the one hand, the incorporation of W, Mo, or Ti greatly increases electronic and ionic conductivity of Li2S composites and inhibits the polysulfide dissolution via the TM&#63743;S bond, effectively addressing the drawbacks of Li2S cathodes. In particular, Li2S/W and Li2S/Mo exhibit the highest ionic conductivity of solid&#8208;phase Li&#8208;ion conductors ever&#8208;reported: 5.44 &#215; 10&#8722;2 and 3.62 &#215; 10&#8722;2 S m&#8722;1, respectively. On the other hand, integrating Co, Mn, and Zn turns Li2S into a prelithiation agent, forming metal sulfides rather than S8 after the full charge. These interesting findings may shed light on the design of Li2S&#8208;based cathode materials.

      <title>Low&#8208;Bandgap Porphyrins for Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells: Materials, Morphology, and Applications</title>
      <dc:description>
Porphyrin is a very promising unit to construct low&#8208;bandgap materials to harness solar photons in the near&#8208;infrared region. This can help organic solar cells (OSCs) maximize solar energy utilization. Recent progress of porphyrin&#8208;based materials, design and synthesis routes, morphology, and applications in OSCs is summarized, and future perspective and endeavors are discussed to facilitate higher performance for OSCs.








Abstract
With developments in materials, thin&#8208;film processing, fine&#8208;tuning of morphology, and optimization of device fabrication, the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs) has improved markedly in recent years. Designing low&#8208;bandgap materials has been a focus in order to maximize solar energy conversion. However, there are only a few successful low&#8208;bandgap donor materials developed with near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption that are well matched to the existing efficient acceptors. Porphyrin has shown great potential as a useful building block for constructing low&#8208;bandgap donor materials due to its large conjugated plane and strong absorption. Porphyrin&#8208;based donor materials have been shown to contribute to many record&#8208;high device efficiencies in small molecule, tandem, ternary, flexible, and OSC/perovskite hybrid solar cells. Specifically, non&#8208;fullerene small&#8208;molecule solar cells have recently shown a high power conversion efficiency of 12% using low&#8208;bandgap porphyrin. All these have validated the great potential of porphyrin derivatives as effective donor materials and made DPPEZnP&#8208;TRs a family of best low&#8208;bandgap donor materials in the OSC field so far. Here, recent progress in the rational design, morphology, dynamics, and multi&#8208;functional applications starting from 2015 will be highlighted to deepen understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationship. Finally, some future directions of porphyrin&#8208;based OSCs are presented.

Recent research progress of biodegradable materials and green processing for green electronics is comprehensively reviewed.

Future development and perspective of green electronics are also proposed and presented.








Abstract
There is little question that the &#8220;electronic revolution&#8221; of the 20th century has impacted almost every aspect of human life. However, the emergence of solid&#8208;state electronics as a ubiquitous feature of an advanced modern society is posing new challenges such as the management of electronic waste (e&#8208;waste) that will remain through the 21st century. In addition to developing strategies to manage such e&#8208;waste, further challenges can be identified concerning the conservation and recycling of scarce elements, reducing the use of toxic materials and solvents in electronics processing, and lowering energy usage during fabrication methods. In response to these issues, the construction of electronic devices from renewable or biodegradable materials that decompose to harmless by&#8208;products is becoming a topic of great interest. Such &#8220;green&#8221; electronic devices need to be fabricated on industrial scale through low&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost methods that involve low/non&#8208;toxic functional materials or solvents. This review highlights recent advances in the development of biodegradable materials and processing strategies for electronics with an emphasis on areas where green electronic devices show the greatest promise, including solar cells, organic field&#8208;effect transistors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and other electronic devices.

      <title>Tubulin&#8208;Based Nanotubes as Delivery Platform for Microtubule&#8208;Targeting Agents</title>
      <dc:description>
Tubulin&#8208;based nanotubes are developed as novel delivery carriers for microtubule&#8208;targeting agents. This work proposes a new strategy of using a drug's target protein as a drug carrier. Upon loading microtubule&#8208;stabilizing/destabilizing agents, the drug&#8208;driven structural/functional transformations and anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo are investigated.








Abstract
Tubulin&#8208;based nanotubes (TNTs) to deliver microtubule&#8208;targeting agents (MTAs) for clinical oncology are reported. Three MTAs, docetaxel (DTX), laulimalide (LMD), and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which attach to different binding sites in a tubulin, are loaded onto TNTs and cause structural changes in them, including shape anisotropy and tubulin layering. This drug&#8208;driven carrier transformation leads to changes in the drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability characteristics of the carrier.

&lt;p&gt;Tubulin&#8208;based nanotubes are developed as novel delivery carriers for microtubule&#8208;targeting agents. This work proposes a new strategy of using a drug's target protein as a drug carrier. Upon loading microtubule&#8208;stabilizing/destabilizing agents, the drug&#8208;driven structural/functional transformations and anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo are investigated.


&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tubulin&#8208;based nanotubes (TNTs) to deliver microtubule&#8208;targeting agents (MTAs) for clinical oncology are reported. Three MTAs, docetaxel (DTX), laulimalide (LMD), and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which attach to different binding sites in a tubulin, are loaded onto TNTs and cause structural changes in them, including shape anisotropy and tubulin layering. This drug&#8208;driven carrier transformation leads to changes in the drug&#8208;loading efficiency and stability characteristics of the carrier. TNTs coloaded with DTX and LMD efficiently deliver dual drug cargoes to cellular tubulins by the endolysosomal pathway, and results in synergistic anticancer and antiangiogenic action of the drugs in vitro. In in vivo tests, TNTs loaded with a microtubule&#8208;destabilizing agent MMAE suppress the growth of tumors with much higher efficacy than free MMAE did. This work suggests a new concept of using a drug's target protein as a carrier. The findings demonstrate that the TNTs developed here can be used universally as a delivery platform for many MTAs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of N&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor via Electric Field Modulated Photo&#8208;Thermoelectric Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
The electric field is demonstrated to enhance the photo&#8208;thermoelectric effect by promoting the exciton separation efficiency with a coupled modulation process. The increased photoinduced carrier concentration and abnormal trade&#8208;off relationship of the TE parameters together lead to a more than 500% enhancement in the PF to 11.2 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2.








Abstract
Modulating photophysical processes is a fundamental way for tuning performance of many organic devices. However, it has not been explored as an effective strategy to manipulate the thermoelectric (TE) conversion of organic semiconductors (OSCs) owing to their critical requirement to carrier concentration (&gt;1018 cm&#8722;3) and the fact of low exciton separation efficiency in single element OSCs. Here, an electric field modulated photo&#8208;thermoelectric (P&#8208;TE) effect in an n&#8208;type OSC is demonstrated to realize a significant improvement of TE performance. The electrical and spectroscopy characterizations reveal that the electric field gating generates combined modulation of exciton separation, charge screening, and carrier recombination, which produces a more than ten times improvement of photoinduced carrier concentration. These coupled processes contribute to the unconventional Seebeck coefficient (S)&#8208;electrical conductivity (&#963;) trade&#8208;off relationship of the photoexcited films, therefore leading to a more than 500% enhancement in the power factor for n&#8208;type OTE semiconductors. This work opens a unique way toward state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic P&#8208;TE materials for energy harvesting applications.

      <dc:description>
Sustainable hydrogen production from water at minimalistic energy expense has always been a challenge. In article number 2000971, Michel Bosman, Swee Ching Tan, and co&#8208;workers report an unprecedented methodology to split atmospheric water (air moisture) by interfacing superhygroscopic hydrogels and ferroelectric embedded semiconductors (BTO@MOS2), and thereby produce hydrogen in the presence of sunlight. This device has an additional zero&#8208;energy indoor dehumidification benefit.

      <dc:description>
A paradigm high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;voltage affordable Zn&#8211;Mn hybrid aqueous battery (HAB) is constructed by Shi&#8208;Zhang Qiao and co&#8208;workers (article number 2001894).

They can only express their love by the media of H+ and OH&#8722;, which produce a streamlet and powers the moon (lamp bulb). The carrier pigeon (Ni) serves as a catalyst to speed&#8208;up the process (reaction).

      <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembled SiO2&#8208;nanoparticle patterns encapsulated by poly(dimethylsiloxane) are developed by Kyungjun Song, Taesung Kim, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001467 as a novel and simple color platform, which can switch between transparent and colored states by mechanical. Upon compression, wrinkles are generated as gratings, enabling the instant display and hiding of information, such as QR codes and trademarks, by external stimuli. The color platform could be applied in anticounterfeiting applications.

      <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: Design, Modulation, and Challenges in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be promising candidates over noble metal catalysts for their electrochemical hydrogen production. The basic mechanism for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is introduced, followed by a description of the different synthesis methods and modulation approaches to enhance the catalytic performance of TMD&#8208;based catalysts toward HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen has been deemed as an ideal substitute fuel to fossil energy because of its renewability and the highest energy density among all chemical fuels. One of the most economical, ecofriendly, and high&#8208;performance ways of hydrogen production is electrochemical water splitting. Recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (also known as 2D TMDs) showed their utilization potentiality as cost&#8208;effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts in water electrolysis. Herein, recent representative research efforts and systematic progress made in 2D TMDs are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are discussed. Furthermore, general methods of synthesizing 2D TMDs materials are introduced in detail and the advantages and disadvantages for some specific methods are provided. This explanation includes several important regulation strategies of creating more active sites, heteroatoms doping, phase engineering, construction of heterostructures, and synergistic modulation which are capable of optimizing the electrical conductivity, exposure to the catalytic active sites, and reaction energy barrier of the electrode material to boost the HER kinetics. In the last section, the current obstacles and future chances for the development of 2D TMDs electrocatalysts are proposed to provide insight into and valuable guidelines for fabricating effective HER electrocatalysts.

Recent progress of MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging technologies are summarized.

Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro&#8208; and nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great potential for applications in the biomedical field, such as active targeted delivery, detoxification, minimally invasive diagnostics, and nanosurgery, owing to their tiny size, autonomous motion, and navigation capacities. To enter the clinic, biomedical MNMs request the biodegradability of their manufacturing materials, the biocompatibility of chemical fuels or externally physical fields, the capability of overcoming various biological barriers (e.g., biofouling, blood flow, blood&#8211;brain barrier, cell membrane), and the in vivo visual positioning for autonomous navigation. Herein, the recent advances of synthetic MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging techniques are highlighted. The challenges and future research priorities are also addressed. With continued attention and innovation, it is believed that, in the future, biomedical MNMs will pave the way to improve the targeted drug delivery efficiency.

      <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Functional Polymeric Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood components are considered as important feedstocks to fabricate functional materials. An insightful summary of recent wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials is provided from the perspective of macromolecular engineering, including the structural characteristics of cellulose and lignin, molecular modification, and subsequent assembly behavior to generate distinctive functional materials.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials due to their distinctive properties, including environmental friendliness, renewability, and biodegradability. Thus, the uniqueness of the main components in wood (cellulose and lignin) has attracted enormous interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, the emerging field of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood&#8208;derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials.

      <title>Bioactive&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Derived Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Permanent Arterial Embolization and Enhanced Vascular Healing</title>
      <dc:description>
A biohybrid hydrogel composed of cardiac&#8208;derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and nanoclay (NC) is developed as a multifunctional embolic biomaterial that offers both the biological activity and the mechanical support necessary for successful arterial embolization. The shear&#8208;thinning ECM&#8211;NC hydrogel exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, retrievability, and proangiogenic characteristics to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed bioactive embolic agent for the treatment of a variety of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Transcatheter embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that uses embolic agents to intentionally block diseased or injured blood vessels for therapeutic purposes. Embolic agents in clinical practice are limited by recanalization, risk of non&#8208;target embolization, failure in coagulopathic patients, high cost, and toxicity. Here, a decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to provide superior mechanical stability, catheter injectability, retrievability, antibacterial properties, and biological activity to prevent recanalization. The embolic efficacy of the shear&#8208;thinning ECM&#8208;based hydrogel is shown in a porcine survival model of embolization in the iliac artery and the renal artery. The ECM&#8208;based hydrogel promotes arterial vessel wall remodeling and a fibroinflammatory response while undergoing significant biodegradation such that only 25% of the embolic material remains at 14 days. With its unprecedented proregenerative, antibacterial properties coupled with favorable mechanical properties, and its superior performance in anticoagulated blood, the ECM&#8208;based hydrogel has the potential to be a next&#8208;generation biofunctional embolic agent that can successfully treat a wide range of vascular diseases.

      <title>Micro&#8208; and Nanostructured Lead Halide Perovskites: From Materials to Integrations and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices. Patterning and integration techniques for nanostructured perovskites are summarized and recent progress in novel nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications is presented.








Abstract
In the past decade, lead halide perovskites have been intensively explored due to their promising future in photovoltaics. Owing to their remarkable material properties such as solution processability, nice defect tolerance, broad bandgap tunability, high quantum yields, large refractive index, and strong nonlinear effects, this family of materials has also shown advantages in many other optoelectronic devices including microlasers, photodetectors, waveguides, and metasurfaces. Very recently, the stability of perovskite devices has been improved with the optimization of synthesis methods and device architectures. It is widely accepted that it is the time to integrate all the perovskite devices into a real system. However, for integrated photonic circuits, the shapes and distributions of chemically synthesized perovskites are quite random and not suitable for integration. Consequently, controlled synthesis and the top&#8208;down fabrication process are highly desirable to break the barriers. Herein, the developments of patterning and integration techniques for halide perovskites, as well as the structure/function relationships, are systematically reviewed. The recent progress in the study of optical responses originating from nanostructured perovskites is also presented. Lastly, the challenges and perspective for nanostructured&#8208;perovskite devices are discussed.

     alt="Micro&#8208; and Nanostructured Lead Halide Perovskites: From Materials to Integrations and Devices"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices. Patterning and integration techniques for nanostructured perovskites are summarized and recent progress in novel nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications is presented.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past decade, lead halide perovskites have been intensively explored due to their promising future in photovoltaics. Owing to their remarkable material properties such as solution processability, nice defect tolerance, broad bandgap tunability, high quantum yields, large refractive index, and strong nonlinear effects, this family of materials has also shown advantages in many other optoelectronic devices including microlasers, photodetectors, waveguides, and metasurfaces. Very recently, the stability of perovskite devices has been improved with the optimization of synthesis methods and device architectures. It is widely accepted that it is the time to integrate all the perovskite devices into a real system. However, for integrated photonic circuits, the shapes and distributions of chemically synthesized perovskites are quite random and not suitable for integration. Consequently, controlled synthesis and the top&#8208;down fabrication process are highly desirable to break the barriers. Herein, the developments of patterning and integration techniques for halide perovskites, as well as the structure/function relationships, are systematically reviewed. The recent progress in the study of optical responses originating from nanostructured perovskites is also presented. Lastly, the challenges and perspective for nanostructured&#8208;perovskite devices are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Based Molten Lithium&#8722;Molybdenum&#8722;Iron(II) Chloride Battery with Advanced Reaction Mechanism</title>

Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten&#8208;metal batteries have attracted considerable attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Although ZEBRA batteries are considered one of the promising candidates, they still have the potential concern of metal particle growth and ion exchange with the &#946;&#8221;&#8208;Al2O3 electrolyte. Herein, a Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8722;molybdenum&#8722;iron(II) chloride battery (denoted as Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl2) operated at temperature of 250 &#176;C, comprising a mixture of Fe and LiCl cathode materials, a Li anode, a garnet&#8208;type Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, and Mo additive, is designed to overcome these obstacles. Different from conventional battery reaction mechanisms, this battery revolutionarily synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8722;Mo alloying&#8722;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8722;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo framework derived from Fe&#8722;Mo alloy simultaneously suppresses the growth of pure Fe particles. By adopting a Li anode and a Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, the corrosion problem between the cathode and the solid electrolyte is overcome. With similar battery cost ($12 kWh&#8722;1), the theoretical energy density of Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl2 battery surpasses that of a Na&#8722;FeCl2 ZEBRA battery over 25%, to 576 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 2216 Wh L&#8722;1, respectively. Experimental results further prove this cell has excellent cycling performance (472 mAh gLiCl&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, 50 mg active material) and strong tolerance against the overcharge&#8722;overdischarge (3&#8722;1.6 V) and freezing&#8722;thawing (25&#8722;250 &#176;C) incidents.

      <title>Quantum Confinement of Dirac Quasiparticles in Graphene Patterned with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Precision</title>
      <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to manipulate ensembles of hydrogen atoms that define insulating channels on graphene in a fast, reversible, robust, and versatile way. This enables the creation, with sub&#8208;nanometer precision, of 0D and 1D graphene nanostructures of arbitrary shapes and dimensions, which perfectly confine graphene Dirac quasiparticles.








Abstract
Quantum confinement of graphene Dirac&#8208;like electrons in artificially crafted nanometer structures is a long sought goal that would provide a strategy to selectively tune the electronic properties of graphene, including bandgap opening or quantization of energy levels. However, creating confining structures with nanometer precision in shape, size, and location remains an experimental challenge, both for top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. Moreover, Klein tunneling, offering an escape route to graphene electrons, limits the efficiency of electrostatic confinement. Here, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is used to create graphene nanopatterns, with sub&#8208;nanometer precision, by the collective manipulation of a large number of H atoms. Individual graphene nanostructures are built at selected locations, with predetermined orientations and shapes, and with dimensions going all the way from 2 nm up to 1 &#181;m. The method permits the patterns to be erased and rebuilt at will, and it can be implemented on different graphene substrates. STM experiments demonstrate that such graphene nanostructures confine very efficiently graphene Dirac quasiparticles, both in 0D and 1D structures. In graphene quantum dots, perfectly defined energy bandgaps up to 0.8 eV are found that scale as the inverse of the dot&#8217;s linear dimension, as expected for massless Dirac fermions.

      <title>Designing a Transparent CdIn2S4/In2S3 Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Photoanode Integrated with a Perovskite Solar Cell for Unbiased Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
CdIn2S4/In2S3 bulk heterojunction nanosheet arrays are designed as photoanodes of photoelectrochemical cells, which have high transparency and high separation efficiency up to 90%. This photoanode is integrated with a perovskite solar cell to form an unbiased solar water&#8208;splitting system, delivering a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 3.3%.








Abstract
The integration of photoelectrochemical photoanodes and solar cells to build an unbiased solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion system provides a promising way to solve the energy crisis. The key point is to develop highly transparent photoanodes, while its bulk separation efficiency (&#951;sep.) and surface injection efficiency are as high as possible. To resolve this contradiction, first a novel CdIn2S4/In2S3 bulk heterojunctions in the interior of nanosheets is designed as a photoanode with high transparency and an ultrahigh &#951;sep. up to 90%. Furthermore, decorating the ultrathin amorphous SnO2 layer by atomic layer deposition, the surface oxygen&#8208;evolution kinetics of the photoanode are increased significantly. As a result, the onset potential of the photoanode shifts negatively to 0.02 V vs RHE, and the photocurrent density boosts to 2.98 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs RHE, which is ten times higher than that of pristine CdIn2S4. Such a high&#8208;performance photoanode enables the integrated metal sulfide photoanode&#8211;perovskite solar cell system to deliver a STH conversion efficiency of 3.3%.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of photoelectrochemical photoanodes and solar cells to build an unbiased solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion system provides a promising way to solve the energy crisis. The key point is to develop highly transparent photoanodes, while its bulk separation efficiency (&#951;&lt;sub&gt;sep.&lt;/sub&gt;) and surface injection efficiency are as high as possible. To resolve this contradiction, first a novel CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bulk heterojunctions in the interior of nanosheets is designed as a photoanode with high transparency and an ultrahigh &#951;&lt;sub&gt;sep.&lt;/sub&gt; up to 90%. Furthermore, decorating the ultrathin amorphous SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layer by atomic layer deposition, the surface oxygen&#8208;evolution kinetics of the photoanode are increased significantly. As a result, the onset potential of the photoanode shifts negatively to 0.02 V vs RHE, and the photocurrent density boosts to 2.98 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23 V vs RHE, which is ten times higher than that of pristine CdIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Such a high&#8208;performance photoanode enables the integrated metal sulfide photoanode&#8211;perovskite solar cell system to deliver a STH conversion efficiency of 3.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Ni&#8208;N4 and Fe&#8208;N4 Sites Constructing Janus Hollow Graphene for Selective Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Separate&#8208;sided Ni&#8208;N4 and Fe&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atomic functionalization of hollow graphene spheres (Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4) is realized. The outer Fe&#8208;N4 clusters dominantly contribute to high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the inner Ni&#8208;N4 clusters are responsible for excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4 air&#8208;cathode delivers excellent energy efficiency and cycling stability in rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single atoms in carbon have aroused extensive interest recently and have been growing as an active research frontier in a wide range of key renewable energy reactions and devices. Herein, a step&#8208;by&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to allocate nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) single atoms respectively on the inner and outer walls of graphene hollow nanospheres (GHSs), realizing separate&#8208;sided different single&#8208;atom functionalization of hollow graphene. The Ni or Fe single atom is demonstrated to be coordinated with four N atoms via the formation of a Ni&#8208;N4 or Fe&#8208;N4 planar configuration. The developed Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4 Janus material exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, in which the outer Fe&#8208;N4 clusters dominantly contribute to high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the inner Ni&#8208;N4 clusters are responsible for excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the structures and reactivities of Fe&#8208;N4 and Ni&#8208;N4 for the ORR and OER. The Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4 endows a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery with excellent energy efficiency and cycling stability as an air&#8208;cathode, outperforming that of the benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 air&#8208;cathode. The current work paves a new avenue for precise control of single&#8208;atom sites on carbon surface for the high&#8208;performance and selective electrocatalysts.

      <title>Conversion of Intercalated MoO3 to Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped MoS2 with High Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
An intercalation&#8208;assisted method is developed to obtain multi&#8208;metal&#8208;doped H&#8208;MoS2, which is proven to be a universal method. The doping of adjacent cobalt and palladium monomers on MoS2 greatly enhances the HER catalytic activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;1 and Tafel slope of Co&#8208;Pd&#8208;MoS2 is 49.3 mV and 43.2 mV dec&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
Lack of effective strategies to regulate the internal activity of MoS2 limits its practical application for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Doping of heteroatoms without forming aggregation or an edge enrichment is still challenging, and its effect on the HER needs to be further explored. Herein, a two&#8208;step method is developed to obtain multi&#8208;metal&#8208;doped H&#8208;MoS2, which includes intercalation of the layered MoO3 precursor with a following sulfurization. Benefiting from the capability of the intercalation method to uniformly and simultaneously introduce different elements into the van der Waals gap, this method is universal to obtain multi&#8208;heteroatoms co&#8208;doped MoS2 without forming clusters, phase separation, and an edge enrichment. It is demonstrated that the doping of adjacent cobalt and palladium monomers on MoS2 greatly enhances the HER catalytic activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of Co and Pd co&#8208;doped MoS2 is found to be 49.3 mV and 43.2 mV dec&#8722;1, respectively, representing a superior acidic HER catalytic activity. This intercalation&#8208;assisted method also provides a new and general strategy to synthesize uniformly doped transition metal dichalcogenides for various applications.

      <dc:description>
New n&#8208;dopable copolymers consisting of naphthodithiophenediimide and bithiopheneimide units are synthesized by direct arylation polymerization. The backbone orientation is found to significantly impact the electrical conductivity and the power factor (PF). Thus, a polymer characterized by the bimodal orientation with both face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on fractions shows PF of up to 53.4 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature, which is among the highest for n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers.








Abstract
The development of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with high electrical conductivity (&#963;) has continued to pose a massive challenge in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). New structural insights into the charge&#8208;carrier transport are necessitated for the realization of high&#8208;performance OTEs. In this study, three new n&#8208;type copolymers, named pNB, pNB&#8208;Tz, and pNB&#8208;TzDP, consisting of naphthodithiophenediimide (NDTI) and bithiopheneimide (BTI) units, are synthesized by direct arylation polymerization. The backbone orientation is altered by incorporating thiazole units into the backbone and tuning the branching point of the side chain. The alteration of the backbone orientation from face&#8208;on to bimodal orientation with both face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on fractions significantly impacts the &#963; and the power factors (PFs) of the polymers. As a result, pNB&#8208;TzDP, with the bimodal orientation, demonstrates a high &#963; of up to 11.6 S cm&#8722;1 and PF of up to 53.4 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which are among the highest in solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers reported so far. Further studies reveal that the bimodal orientation of pNB&#8208;TzDP introduces 3D conduction channels and leads to better accommodation of dopants, which should be the key factors for the excellent thermoelectric performance.

      <title>High&#8208;Index&#8208;Facet Metal&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles as Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
A method to introduce high&#8208;index facets into compositionally uniform colloidal Pt&#8211;M (M = Ni, Co, and Cu) and Rh&#8211;M (M = Ni and Co) nanoparticles is developed. The resulting catalysts have three features favorable for catalytic performance: high&#8208;index facets, surface Bi modification, and alloying with transition metals, where their influence on catalyst performance differs from reaction to reaction.








Abstract
A method to introduce high&#8208;index facets into colloidally synthesized nanoparticles is used to produce compositionally uniform Pt&#8211;M (M = Ni, Co, and Cu) and Rh&#8211;M (M = Ni and Co) tetrahexahedral nanoparticles. The realization of this method allows for a systematic study of catalyst activity as a function of particle composition for various electrooxidation reactions of liquid fuels (formic acid, methanol, and ethanol). The individual contributions of their high&#8208;index facets, internal alloying of transition metals, and surface Bi modification to their electrocatalytic properties are experimentally explored, resulting in three key findings. First, the presence of high&#8208;index facets is favorable for improving the catalytic activity for all three classes of reactions studied. Second, the effect of transition metal alloying on catalytic activity differs from reaction to reaction. For methanol electrooxidation in an acid electrolyte, due to the contribution from surface Bi modification being negligible, transition metal alloying can significantly the improve overall catalytic efficiency. However, for the other studied reactions, where the surface Bi is highly favorable for improving catalytic activity, there is little influence from transition metal alloying. Finally, multimetallic tetrahexahedral particles have improved stabilities during prolonged operation compared to their monometallic counterparts due to the presence of the alloyed transition metal atoms.

The realization of this method allows for a systematic study of catalyst activity as a function of particle composition for various electrooxidation reactions of liquid fuels (formic acid, methanol, and ethanol). The individual contributions of their high&#8208;index facets, internal alloying of transition metals, and surface Bi modification to their electrocatalytic properties are experimentally explored, resulting in three key findings. First, the presence of high&#8208;index facets is favorable for improving the catalytic activity for all three classes of reactions studied. Second, the effect of transition metal alloying on catalytic activity differs from reaction to reaction. For methanol electrooxidation in an acid electrolyte, due to the contribution from surface Bi modification being negligible, transition metal alloying can significantly the improve overall catalytic efficiency. However, for the other studied reactions, where the surface Bi is highly favorable for improving catalytic activity, there is little influence from transition metal alloying. Finally, multimetallic tetrahexahedral particles have improved stabilities during prolonged operation compared to their monometallic counterparts due to the presence of the alloyed transition metal atoms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Constructing an Adaptive Heterojunction as a Highly Active Catalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrochemical delithiation and surface reconstruction of LiNiO2 lead to the formation of an adaptive heterojunction between delithiated&#8208;LiNiO2 and the surface NiOOH layer. Such a process facilitates the formation of NiOO* species within the reconstructed NiOOH surface and the OER activity is boosted significantly.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is of prime importance to green energy technology. Particularly, the reaction at the anode side, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requires a high overpotential associated with O&#63743;O bond formation, which dominates the energy&#8208;efficiency of the whole process. Activating the anionic redox chemistry of oxygen in metal oxides, which involves the formation of superoxo/peroxo&#8208;like (O2)n&#8722;, commonly occurs in most highly active catalysts during the OER process. In this study, a highly active catalyst is designed: electrochemically delithiated LiNiO2, which facilitates the formation of superoxo/peroxo&#8208;like (O2)n&#8722; species, i.e., NiOO*, for enhancing OER activity. The OER&#8208;induced surface reconstruction builds an adaptive heterojunction, where NiOOH grows on delithiated LiNiO2 (delithiated&#8208;LiNiO2/NiOOH). At this junction, the lithium vacancies within the delithiated LiNiO2 optimize the electronic structure of the surface NiOOH to form stable NiOO* species, which enables better OER activity. This finding provides new insight for designing highly active catalysts with stable superoxo&#8208;like/peroxo&#8208;like (O2)n&#8722; for water oxidation.

      <title>Multiply Charged Conjugated Polyelectrolytes as a Multifunctional Interlayer for Efficient and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are studied as interlayers in perovskite&#8208;based solar cells. By modulating the ionic density in CPEs, wetting, perovskite crystal growth, and interfacial defect passivation are optimized, achieving 18.38% efficiency for a large&#8208;area (1 cm2) device with negligible hysteresis and stable power output.








Abstract
A series of anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is synthesized based on poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) by varying the side&#8208;chain ionic density from two to six per repeat units (MPS2&#8208;TMA, MPS4&#8208;TMA, and MPS6&#8208;TMA). The effect of MPS2, 4, 6&#8208;TMA as interlayers on top of a hole&#8208;extraction layer of poly(bis(4&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenylamine (PTAA) is investigated in inverted perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Owing to the improved wettability of perovskites on hydrophobic PTAA with the CPEs, the PeSCs with CPE interlayers demonstrate a significantly enhanced device performance, with negligible device&#8208;to&#8208;device dependence relative to the reference PeSC without CPEs. By increasing the ionic density in the MPS&#8208;TMA interlayers, the wetting, interfacial defect passivation, and crystal growth of the perovskites are significantly improved without increasing the series resistance of the PeSCs. In particular, the open&#8208;circuit voltage increases from 1.06 V for the PeSC with MPS2&#8208;TMA to 1.11 V for the PeSC with MPS6&#8208;TMA. The trap densities of the PeSCs with MPS2,4,6&#8208;TMA are further analyzed using frequency&#8208;dependent capacitance measurements. Finally, a large&#8208;area (1 cm2) PeSC is successfully fabricated with MPS6&#8208;TMA, showing a power conversion efficiency of 18.38% with negligible hysteresis and a stable power output under light soaking for 60 s.

      <title>Directed Assembly of Liquid Metal&#8211;Elastomer Conductors for Stretchable and Self&#8208;Healing Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Dielectrophoresis&#8208;assisted alignment of eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) microdroplets in a silicone matrix enables the fabrication of stretchable and flexible electrically conducting microwires at significantly low weight loadings (10 wt%). Liquid EGaIn eliminates compliance mismatch with the elastomeric matrix. This directed assembly within a silicone&#8211;EGaIn &#8220;ink&#8221; can heal severely damaged regions of stretchable interconnects to restore mechanical integrity and electrical conductivity.








Abstract
Growing interest in soft robotics, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins has created demand for soft, compliant, and stretchable electrodes and interconnects. Here, dielectrophoresis (DEP) is used to assemble, align, and sinter eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) microdroplets in uncured poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) to form electrically conducting microwires. There are several noteworthy aspects of this approach. 1) Generally, EGaIn droplets in silicone at loadings approaching 90 wt% remain insulating and form a conductive network only when subjected to sintering. Here, DEP facilitates assembly of EGaIn droplets into conductive microwires at loadings as low as 10 wt%. 2) DEP is done in silicone for the first time, enabling the microwires to be cured in a stretchable matrix. 3) Liquid EGaIn droplets sinter during DEP to form a stretchable metallic microwire that retains its shape after curing the silicone. 4) Use of liquid metal eliminates the issue of compliance mismatch observed in soft polymers with solid fillers. 5) The silicone&#8211;EGaIn &#8220;ink&#8221; can be assembled by DEP within the crevices of severely damaged wires to create stretchable interconnects that heal the damage mechanically and electrically. The DEP process of this unique set of materials is characterized and the interesting attributes enabled by such liquid microwires are demonstrated.

      <dc:description>
A Cs4PbI6&#8208;mediated method is developed to fabricate cesium (Cs)&#8208;rich perovskite films. It is also found that &#8776;15% alloying with the organic formamidine (FA) cation can sufficiently stabilize the perovskite phase with excellent phase and UV&#8208;irradiation stability. FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 17.5%.








Abstract
The stability issue is still one of the main limitations of the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. The mixed cation FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 has shown great promise owing to its improved thermal and moisture stability. However, the study of FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 is concentrated on formamidine (FA)&#8208;rich perovskite, whereas cesium (Cs)&#8208;rich FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskites are barely studied due to the inevitable phase separation when Cs &gt; 30 mol%. Here, a Cs4PbI6&#8208;mediated method is developed to synthesize Cs&#8208;rich FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskites. It is demonstrated that Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase has a low Cs cation diffusion barrier and therefore offers a fast ion exchange with the preformed FA&#8208;rich perovskite phase to finally form the Cs&#8208;rich FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskite. The results indicate that &#8776;15% alloying with organic FA cations can sufficiently stabilize the perovskite phase with excellent phase and UV&#8208;irradiation stability. The FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 perovskite solar cells achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 17.5%, showing the great potential of Cs&#8208;based perovskites for efficient and stable solar cells.

      <title>Hofmeister&#8208;Effect&#8208;Guided Ionohydrogel Design as Printable Bioelectronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Transducing biosignals imperatively needs a hybrid circuit of mobile ions and electrons. An ionohydrogel bioelectronic platform is developed via enzymatic polymerization in hydrated ionic liquids, realizing the integration of ionic and enzymatic electronic circuits. The platform ensures the high bioactivity of enzymes and favorable ionic conductivity that are integrated into an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use glucose sensor and a wireless human&#8208;motion monitor and energy&#8208;storage device.








Abstract
Bioelectronic platforms convert biological signals into electrical signals by utilizing biocatalysts that provide tools to monitor the activity of cells and tissues. Traditional conducting materials such as solid conductors and conducting polymers are confronted with a great challenge in sophisticated production processes and mismatch at biological tissues&#8211;machine interfaces. Furthermore, the biocatalyst, the key functional component in the electron&#8208;transfer reaction for bio&#8208;signal detection denatures easily in an ionic conductive solution. Herein, a bionic strategy is elaborately developed to synthesize an ionohydrogel bioelectronic platform that possesses extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like habitat by employing hydrated ionic liquids (HILs) as ionic solvent and bioprotectant. This strategy realizes an integration of ionic and enzymatic electronic circuits and minimization of the disparities between tissues and artificial machines. The Hofmeister effect of HILs on enzyme proteins and polymer chains ensures the high bioactivity of the enzymes and greatly improves the mechanical properties of the ionohydrogels. Moreover, hydrogen bonds formed by ILs, water, and polymer chains greatly improve the water&#8208;retention of the ionohydrogel and give it more practical significance. Consequently, the promising ionohydrogel is partly printed and fabricated into wearable devices as a pain&#8208;free humoral components monitor and a wireless motion&#8208;sensor.

      <title>An All&#8208;Scale Hierarchical Architecture Induces Colossal Room&#8208;Temperature Electrocaloric Effect at Ultralow Electric Field in Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;scale hierarchical approach to achieving ultrahigh electrocaloric (EC) strength in flexible polymer composites is proposed and demonstrated. The enhanced EC performance is mainly attributed to the hierarchical interfaces inside the composite nanofibers. In addition, the orthotropic configuration of the BFO@BZT_nfs inside the terpolymer matrix further increases Eb of the nanocomposite and leads to substantially enhanced EC strength under a moderate electric field.








Abstract
Composed of electrocaloric (EC) ceramics and polymers, polymer composites with high EC performances are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cooling devices. Their mass application is limited by the low EC strength, which requires very high operational voltage to induce appreciable temperature change. Here, an all&#8208;scale hierarchical architecture is proposed and demonstrated to achieve high EC strength in poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene)&#8208;based nanocomposites. On the atomic scale, highly polarizable hierarchical interfaces are induced by incorporating BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles in Ba(Zr0.21Ti0.79)O3 (BZT) nanofibers (BFO@BZT_nfs); on the microscopic scale, percolation of the interfaces further raises the polarization of the composite nanofibers; on the mesoscopic scale, orthotropic orientation of BFO@BZT_nfs leads to much enhanced breakdown strength of the nanocomposites. As a result, an ultrahigh EC strength of &#8776;0.22 K m MV&#8722;1 is obtained at an ultralow electric field of 75 MV m&#8722;1 in nanocomposites filled with the orthotropic composite nanofibers, which is by far the highest value achieved in polymer nanocomposites at a moderate electric field. Results of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, in situ scanning Kelvin probe microscopy characterization, and phase&#8208;field simulations all indicate that the much enhanced EC performances can be attributed to the all&#8208;scale hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite.

      <title>Identifying the Origin of Ti3+ Activity toward Enhanced Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction over TiO2 Nanoparticles Modulated by Mixed&#8208;Valent Copper</title>
      <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;doped TiO2 nanoparticles are highly active toward ambient N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion with excellent selectivity. In 0.5 m LiClO4, this catalyst attains a high Faradaic efficiency of 21.99% and a large NH3 yield of 21.31 &#181;g h&#8210;1 mgcat.&#8210;1 at &#8210;0.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density function theory calculations are further discussed for the N2 reduction reaction catalytic mechanism on the Cu&#8208;doped TiO2 (101) surface.








Abstract
The ambient electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) enabled by TiO2 has attracted extensive recent attention. Previous studies suggest the formation of Ti3+ in TiO2 can significantly improve the NRR activity, but it still remains unclear what kinds of Ti3+ are effective. Herein, it is demonstrated that mixed&#8208;valent Cu acts as an effective dopant to modulate the oxygen vacancy (VO) concentration and Ti3+ formation, which markedly improves the electrocatalytic NRR performance. In 0.5 m LiClO4, this electrocatalyst attains a high Faradic efficiency of 21.99% and a large NH3 yield of 21.31 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8211;0.55 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, which even surpasses most reported Ti&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts. Using density function theory calculations, it is evidenced that mixed&#8208;valent Cu ions modulate the TiO2 (101) surface with multiple oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for generating different Ti3+ 3d1 defect states localized below the Fermi energy. N2 activation and adsorption are effectively strengthened when Ti3+ 3d1 defect states present the splitting of eg and t2g orbitals, which can be modulated by its coordination structure. The synergistic roles of the three ion pairs formed by the VO defect, including Cu1+&#8211;Ti4+, Ti3+&#8211;Ti4+ and Ti3+&#8211;Ti3+, are together responsible for the enhanced NRR performance.

      <title>Anion Substitution in Porous Aromatic Frameworks: Boosting Molecular Permeability and Selectivity for Membrane Acetylene Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
The strategy of anion substitution is proposed to infix hydroxide anions in the pores of porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). These alkaline anions preferentially and massively adsorb acidic acetylene molecules, enabling both good selectivity and high permeability for acetylene over ethylene and ethane through the PAF&#8208;based membranes.








Abstract
Precise tailoring of pore chemistry is indispensable for efficient membrane gas separation, particularly for the challenging acetylene system. Here, a strategy called &#8220;anion substitution&#8221; is reported, to strengthen the interaction between anions and acetylene within the pores, for radically improving gas selectivity and permeability. The anions F&#8722; and OH&#8722; are infixed in iPAF&#8208;1 to replace the original Cl&#8722; ion. Their small anionic radii allow retention of the original high porosity of iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;Cl in iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;F and iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;OH. Highly basic F&#8722; and OH&#8722; confined in the pores attract acidic acetylene strongly and preferentially. Nanoparticles of iPAF&#8208;1 are processed to form mixed matrix membranes, represented by iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;OH/6FDA&#8208;ODA. The prepared membranes exhibit remarkable performance in separating acetylene from ethylene and ethane. Transplantation of porous and functional iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;OH into 6FDA&#8208;ODA significantly enhances both acetylene permeability (sevenfold) and permselectivity (fivefold) for acetylene over ethylene and ethane, which is crucial for membrane acetylene gas separation.

      <title>Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Magnetic Nanoparticles with Applications in Biomedicine</title>
      <dc:description>
An overview of the magnetism dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles and its relevance to optimizing and further developing biomedical applications is presented, with a specific focus on the applications of magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia. A summary of historical and current theoretical and computational models of nanoparticle dynamics is given.








Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles are currently the focus of investigation for a wide range of biomedical applications that fall into the categories of imaging, sensing, and therapeutics. A deep understanding of nanoparticle magnetization dynamics is fundamental to optimization and further development of these applications. Here, a summary of theoretical models of nanoparticle dynamics is presented, and computational nonequilibrium models are outlined, which currently represent the most sophisticated methods for modeling nanoparticle dynamics. Nanoparticle magnetization response is explored in depth; the effect of applied field amplitude, as well as nanoparticle size, on the resulting rotation mechanism and timescale is investigated. Two applications in biomedicine, magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia, are highlighted.

     alt="Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Magnetic Nanoparticles with Applications in Biomedicine"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview of the magnetism dynamics of magnetic nanoparticles and its relevance to optimizing and further developing biomedical applications is presented, with a specific focus on the applications of magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia. A summary of historical and current theoretical and computational models of nanoparticle dynamics is given.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic nanoparticles are currently the focus of investigation for a wide range of biomedical applications that fall into the categories of imaging, sensing, and therapeutics. A deep understanding of nanoparticle magnetization dynamics is fundamental to optimization and further development of these applications. Here, a summary of theoretical models of nanoparticle dynamics is presented, and computational nonequilibrium models are outlined, which currently represent the most sophisticated methods for modeling nanoparticle dynamics. Nanoparticle magnetization response is explored in depth; the effect of applied field amplitude, as well as nanoparticle size, on the resulting rotation mechanism and timescale is investigated. Two applications in biomedicine, magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia, are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Nanoenergetic Materials: Preparation and Fundamental Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
The &#8220;shell&#8221; of core&#8211;shell structured explosives is like a protective &#8220;coat&#8221; on the sensitive explosive, making them more resistant to external stimuli. The fuel and oxidizer in core&#8211;shell structured metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) are like a well&#8208;matched &#8220;gear,&#8221; they have large and close contact with each other, so that the thermite reaction exhibits increased heat output and improved reactivity.








Abstract
Energetic materials, including explosives, pyrotechnics, and propellants, are widely used in mining, demolition, automobile airbags, fireworks, ordnance, and space technology. Nanoenergetic materials (nEMs) have a high reaction rate and high energy density, which are both adjustable to a large extent. Structural control over nEMs to achieve improved performance and multifunctionality leads to a fascinating research area, namely, nanostructured energetic materials. Among them, core&#8211;shell structured nEMs have gained considerable attention due to their improved material properties and combined multiple functionalities. Various nEMs with core&#8211;shell structures have been developed through diverse synthesis routes, among which core&#8211;shell structured nEMs associated with explosives and metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) are extensively studied due to their good tunability and wide applications, as well as excellent energetic (e.g., enhanced heat release and combustion) and/or mechanical properties. Herein, the preparation methods and fundamental properties of the abovementioned kinds of core&#8211;shell structured nEMs are summarized and the reasons behind the satisfactory performance clarified, based on which suggestions regarding possible future research directions are proposed.

      <title>Why Cellulose&#8208;Based Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices?</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress of cellulose, as an appealing natural material that can outperform traditional synthetic materials, for use in energy&#8208;storage devices is described. Cellulose can bring benefits in the fabrication and properties of energy&#8208;storage materials and devices, eventually enabling significant improvements in electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility, cost competitiveness, and form factors, which are difficult to achieve with conventional power source technologies.








Abstract
Recent findings demonstrate that cellulose, a highly abundant, versatile, sustainable, and inexpensive material, can be used in the preparation of very stable and flexible electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy and power densities by using electrodes with high mass loadings, composed of conducting composites with high surface areas and thin layers of electroactive material, as well as cellulose&#8208;based current collectors and functional separators. Close attention should, however, be paid to the properties of the cellulose (e.g., porosity, pore distribution, pore&#8208;size distribution, and crystallinity). The manufacturing of cellulose&#8208;based electrodes and all&#8208;cellulose devices is also well&#8208;suited for large&#8208;scale production since it can be made using straightforward filtration&#8208;based techniques or paper&#8208;making approaches, as well as utilizing various printing techniques. Herein, the recent development and possibilities associated with the use of cellulose are discussed, regarding the manufacturing of electrochemical energy storage devices comprising electrodes with high energy and power densities and lightweight current collectors and functional separators.

      <title>Room&#8208;Temperature All&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Metal Batteries Based on Fusible Alloys with Regulated Interfacial Chemistry and Wetting</title>
      <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature all&#8208;liquid&#8208;metal battery with the lowest operating temperature is constructed. On the basis of improved wetting and stabilized interfacial chemistry, such liquid metal batteries deliver stable cycling performance and negligible self&#8208;discharge, which is promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Liquid metal batteries are regarded as potential electrochemical systems for stationary energy storage. Currently, all reported liquid metal batteries need to be operated at temperatures above 240 &#176;C to maintain the metallic electrodes in a molten state. Here, an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature liquid metal battery employing a sodium&#8211;potassium (Na&#8211;K) alloy anode and gallium (Ga)&#8208;based alloy cathodes is demonstrated. Compared with lead (Pb)&#8208; and mercury (Hg)&#8208;based liquid metal electrodes, the nontoxic Ga alloys maintain high environmental benignity. On the basis of improved wetting and stabilized interfacial chemistry, such liquid metal batteries deliver stable cycling performance and negligible self&#8208;discharge. Different from the conventional interphase between a typical solid electrode and a liquid electrolyte, the interphase between a liquid metal and a liquid electrolyte is directly visualized via advanced 3D chemical analysis. Insights into this new type of liquid electrode/electrolyte interphase reveal its important role in regulating charge carriers and stabilizing the redox chemistry. With facile cell fabrication, simplified battery structures, high safety, and low maintenance costs, room&#8208;temperature liquid metal batteries not only show great prospects for widespread applications, but also offer a pathway toward developing innovative energy&#8208;storage devices beyond conventional solid&#8208;state batteries or high&#8208;temperature batteries.

      <title>The Effect of Thiol Structure on Allyl Sulfide Photodegradable Hydrogels and their Application as a Degradable Scaffold for Organoid Passaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Allyl sulfide photodegradable hydrogels support the formation of epithelial colonies from encapsulated single intestinal stem cells, maintaining their potential to proliferate and differentiate. Rapid photodegradation afforded by allyl sulfide exchange offers the ability to repetitively passage colonies, providing an alternative to commonly used, animal&#8208;derived matrices for intestinal organoid culture.








Abstract
Intestinal organoids are useful in vitro models for basic and translational studies aimed at understanding and treating disease. However, their routine culture relies on animal&#8208;derived matrices that limit translation to clinical applications. In fact, there are few fully defined, synthetic hydrogel systems that allow for the expansion of intestinal organoids. Here, an allyl sulfide photodegradable hydrogel is presented, achieving rapid degradation through radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) reactions, to support routine passaging of intestinal organoids. Shear rheology to first characterize the effect of thiol and allyl sulfide crosslink structures on degradation kinetics is used. Irradiation with 365 nm light (5 mW cm&#8722;2) in the presence of a soluble thiol (glutathione at 15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m), and a photoinitiator (lithium phenyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoylphosphinate at 1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m), leads to complete hydrogel degradation in less than 15 s. Allyl sulfide hydrogels are used to support the formation of epithelial colonies from single intestinal stem cells, and rapid photodegradation is used to achieve repetitive passaging of stem cell colonies without loss in morphology or organoid formation potential. This platform could support long&#8208;term culture of intestinal organoids, potentially replacing the need for animal&#8208;derived matrices, while also allowing systematic variations to the hydrogel properties tailored for the organoid of interest.

      <title>Combining Qdot Nanotechnology and DNA Nanotechnology for Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly multiplexed and high&#8208;sensitivity immunohistochemistry imaging is achieved by combining Qdot nanotechnology with DNA nanotechnology. The Qdots' unique optical properties and primer exchange reaction's programmability allow rapid, sensitive, and specific immunostaining in single cells.








Abstract
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can provide detailed information about protein expression within the cell microenvironment and is one of the most common techniques in biology and medicine due to the broad availability of highly specific antibodies and well&#8208;established bioconjugation methods for modification of these antibodies with chromogens and fluorophores. Despite recent advances in this field, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve high multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput in single&#8208;cell profiling experiments. Here, the combination of two powerful technologies is reported, quantum dot and signal amplification by exchange reaction (QD&#8208;SABER), for sensitive and multiplexed imaging of endogenous proteins. Compared to the conventional IHC process using dye&#8208;labeled secondary antibodies (which already has a built&#8208;in signal amplification mechanism), QD&#8208;SABER provides an additional 7.6&#8208;fold signal amplification. In addition, the DNA hybridization&#8208;based IHC can be rapidly removed to regenerate the sample for subsequent cycles of immunostaining (&gt;10 cycles), greatly expanding the multiplexing capability.

      <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles Directly Present Tumor Antigens to Promote Anticancer Immunity</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer cells are genetically engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker that enables them to directly present their own antigens under an immunostimulatory context. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles sourced from these modified cells elicit antitumor immunity in vivo while bypassing the need for traditional cell&#8208;mediated antigen presentation. This approach may ultimately enable the facile design of personalized artificial antigen presentation platforms.








Abstract
The recent success of immunotherapies has highlighted the power of leveraging the immune system in the fight against cancer. In order for most immune&#8208;based therapies to succeed, T cell subsets with the correct tumor&#8208;targeting specificities must be mobilized. When such specificities are lacking, providing the immune system with tumor antigen material for processing and presentation is a common strategy for stimulating antigen&#8208;specific T cell populations. While straightforward in principle, experience has shown that manipulation of the antigen presentation process can be incredibly complex, necessitating sophisticated strategies that are difficult to translate. Herein, the design of a biomimetic nanoparticle platform is reported that can be used to directly stimulate T cells without the need for professional antigen&#8208;presenting cells. The nanoparticles are fabricated using a cell membrane coating derived from cancer cells engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker. Combined with the peptide epitopes naturally presented on the membrane surface, the final formulation contains the necessary signals to promote tumor antigen&#8208;specific immune responses, priming T cells that can be used to control tumor growth. The reported approach represents an emerging strategy that can be used to develop multiantigenic, personalized cancer immunotherapies.

      <title>Coupling a Crystal Graph Multilayer Descriptor to Active Learning for Rapid Discovery of 2D Ferromagnetic Semiconductors/Half&#8208;Metals/Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
An adaptive framework with the combination of machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques and high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations is designed to discover novel 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors, half&#8208;metals, and metals. Additionally, a new universal material descriptor is proposed for thermal, magnetic, and electronic properties of diverse 2D materials, with which ML models achieve high prediction accuracy over 90%.








Abstract
2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors/half&#8208;metals/metals are the key materials toward next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. However, such materials are still rather rare and the material search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here, an adaptive framework to accelerate the discovery of 2D intrinsic FM materials is developed, by combining advanced machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques with high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations. Successfully, about 90 intrinsic FM materials with desirable bandgap and excellent thermodynamic stability are screened out and a database containing 1459 2D magnetic materials is set up. To improve the performance of ML models on small&#8208;scale datasets like diverse 2D materials, a crystal graph multilayer descriptor using the elemental property is proposed, with which ML models achieve prediction accuracy over 90% on thermodynamic stability, magnetism, and bandgap. This study not only provides dozens of compelling FM candidates for future spintronics, but also paves a feasible route for ML&#8208;based rapid screening of diverse structures and/or complex properties.

&lt;p&gt;An adaptive framework with the combination of machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques and high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations is designed to discover novel 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors, half&#8208;metals, and metals. Additionally, a new universal material descriptor is proposed for thermal, magnetic, and electronic properties of diverse 2D materials, with which ML models achieve high prediction accuracy over 90%.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors/half&#8208;metals/metals are the key materials toward next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. However, such materials are still rather rare and the material search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here, an adaptive framework to accelerate the discovery of 2D intrinsic FM materials is developed, by combining advanced machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques with high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations. Successfully, about 90 intrinsic FM materials with desirable bandgap and excellent thermodynamic stability are screened out and a database containing 1459 2D magnetic materials is set up. To improve the performance of ML models on small&#8208;scale datasets like diverse 2D materials, a crystal graph multilayer descriptor using the elemental property is proposed, with which ML models achieve prediction accuracy over 90% on thermodynamic stability, magnetism, and bandgap. This study not only provides dozens of compelling FM candidates for future spintronics, but also paves a feasible route for ML&#8208;based rapid screening of diverse structures and/or complex properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mesoporous PdAg Nanospheres for Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdAg nanospheres can enable electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high activity, selectivity, and most remarkably excellent stability superior to most previous reports. The great performance is believed to arise from the strong electronic coupling between Pd and Ag upon alloying, which effectively alleviates the CO poisoning on surface.








Abstract
Palladium is a promising material for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency near the equilibrium potential. It unfortunately suffers from problematic operation stability due to CO poisoning on surface. Here, it is demonstrated that alloying is an effective strategy to alleviate this problem. Mesoporous PdAg nanospheres with uniform size and composition are prepared from the co&#8208;reduction of palladium and silver precursors in aqueous solution using dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride as the structure&#8208;directing agent. The best candidate can initiate CO2 reduction at zero overpotential and achieve high formate selectivity close to 100% and great stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The high selectivity and stability are believed to result from the electronic coupling between Pd and Ag, which lowers the d&#8208;band center of Pd and thereby significantly enhances its CO tolerance, as evidenced by both electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulations.

      <title>Electro&#8208;Optic Upconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures via Nonequilibrium Photocarrier Tunneling</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonthermalized photocarrier energy is harnessed to achieve near&#8208;infrared to visible light upconversion in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor van der Waals heterostructure tunnel diode consisting of few&#8208;layer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and monolayer tungsten disulfide. The photocarrier transport dynamics governed by Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling are electrically tunable by two orders of magnitude using voltage bias applied to the device.








Abstract
Ultrafast interlayer charge transfer is one of the most distinct features of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Its dynamics competes with carrier thermalization such that the energy of nonthermalized photocarriers may be harnessed by band engineering. In this study, nonthermalized photocarrier energy is harnessed to achieve near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible light upconversion in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) vdW heterostructure tunnel diode consisting of few&#8208;layer graphene (FLG), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2). Photoexcitation of the electrically biased heterostructure with 1.58 eV NIR laser in the linear absorption regime generates emission from the ground exciton state of WS2, which corresponds to upconversion by &#8776;370 meV. The upconversion is realized by electrically assisted interlayer transfer of nonthermalized photoexcited holes from FLG to WS2, followed by formation and radiative recombination of excitons in WS2. The photocarrier transfer rate can be described by Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling mechanism and is electrically tunable by two orders of magnitude by tuning voltage bias applied to the device. This study highlights the prospects for realizing novel electro&#8208;optic upconversion devices by exploiting electrically tunable nonthermalized photocarrier relaxation dynamics in vdW heterostructures.

      <title>Gas Diffusion Strategy for Inserting Atomic Iron Sites into Graphitized Carbon Supports for Unusually High&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction and High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A universal gas diffusion strategy is developed for fabricating a series of single&#8208;atom catalysts with atomic Fe sites at trace amount supported by dimension&#8208;controlled graphitized carbons. Benefitting from highly catalytic active isolated Fe&#8208;N3 sites and graphitic N species, the optimized Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 exhibits superior CO2 electroreduction activity and outstanding Zn&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER), but the design of highly active and cost&#8208;efficient SACs is still challenging. Herein, a gas diffusion strategy, along with one&#8208;step thermal activation, for fabricating N&#8208;doped porous carbon polyhedrons with trace isolated Fe atoms (Fe1NC) is developed. The optimized Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 with atomic Fe&#8208;N3 sites supported by N&#8208;doped graphitic carbons exhibits superior CO2ER performance with the CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96% at &#8722;0.5 V, turnover frequency of 2225 h&#8722;1, and outstanding stability, outperforming almost all previously reported SACs based on N&#8208;doped carbon supported nonprecious metals. The observed excellent CO2ER performance is attributed to the greatly enhanced accessibility and intrinsic activity of active centers due to the increased electrochemical surface area through size modulation and the redistribution of doped N species by thermal activation. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe&#8208;N3 sites possess balanced adsorption energies of *COOH and *CO intermediates, facilitating CO formation. A universal gas diffusion strategy is used to exclusively yield a series of dimension&#8208;controlled carbon&#8208;supported SACs with single Fe atoms while a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 as cathode is developed to deliver a maximal power density of 0.6 mW cm&#8722;2.

      <title>Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxidation control of graphene quantum dots can tune singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions. A new design approach for engineering singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting through facile molecular manipulation will enable the realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow emissions, such as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), are beneficial in the fields of displays, bioimaging, and data security. However, it is challenging to realize a single material that simultaneously exhibits both RTP and TADF properties with their relative strengths varied in a controlled manner. Herein, a new design approach is reported to control singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;EST) in graphene quantum dots (GQD)/graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) by varying the ratio of oxygenated carbon to sp2 carbon (&#947;OC). It is demonstrated that &#8710;EST decreases from 0.365 to 0.123 eV as &#947;OC increases from 4.63% to 59.6%, which in turn induces a dramatic transition from RTP to TADF. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to both RTP and TADF. Embedded in boron oxynitride, the low oxidized (4.63%) GQD exhibits an RTP lifetime (&#964;Tavg) of 783 ms, and the highly oxidized (59.6%) GOQD exhibits a TADF lifetime (&#964;DFavg) of 125 ms. Furthermore, the long&#8208;lived RTP and TADF materials enable the first demonstration of anticounterfeiting and multilevel information security using GQD. These results will open up a new approach to the engineering of singlet&#8211;triplet splitting in GQD for controlled realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.

      <title>Plant Nanomaterials and Inspiration from Nature: Water Interactions and Hierarchically Structured Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, wood&#8208;based and man&#8208;made hydrogels are produced taking advantage of the properties and structure of elements present in the cell walls of plants, including (nano)celluloses. They endow new materials with features that include directionality, hierarchy, responsiveness, and function, all of which are associated to the composition and morphology of the building blocks.








Abstract
Recent developments in the area of plant&#8208;based hydrogels are introduced, especially those derived from wood as a widely available, multiscale, and hierarchical source of nanomaterials, as well as other cell wall elements. With water being fundamental in a hydrogel, water interactions, hydration, and swelling, all critically important in designing, processing, and achieving the desired properties of sustainable and functional hydrogels, are highlighted.

     alt="Plant Nanomaterials and Inspiration from Nature: Water Interactions and Hierarchically Structured Hydrogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired from nature, wood&#8208;based and man&#8208;made hydrogels are produced taking advantage of the properties and structure of elements present in the cell walls of plants, including (nano)celluloses. They endow new materials with features that include directionality, hierarchy, responsiveness, and function, all of which are associated to the composition and morphology of the building blocks.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent developments in the area of plant&#8208;based hydrogels are introduced, especially those derived from wood as a widely available, multiscale, and hierarchical source of nanomaterials, as well as other cell wall elements. With water being fundamental in a hydrogel, water interactions, hydration, and swelling, all critically important in designing, processing, and achieving the desired properties of sustainable and functional hydrogels, are highlighted. A plant, by itself, is a form of a hydrogel, at least at given states of development, and for this reason phenomena such as fluid transport, diffusion, capillarity, and ionic effects are examined. These aspects are highly relevant not only to plants, especially lignified tissues, but also to the porous structures produced after removal of water (foams, sponges, cryogels, xerogels, and aerogels). Thus, a useful source of critical and comprehensive information is provided regarding the synthesis of hydrogels from plant materials (and especially wood nanostructures), and about the role of water, not only for processing but for developing hydrogel properties and uses.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Changes of Structure and Bonding with Thickness in Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
A first&#8208;principles study of the structure, bonding, and ferroelectricity in quasi 2D monochalcogenides (GeSe, GeTe, SnSe, SnTe) is carried out. It is found that a few bilayers are sufficient to recover the bulk behavior in selenides, while the tellurides deviate strongly from the bulk, even for thick models. These differences stem from the effects of depolarizing fields and the different bonding mechanisms.








Abstract
Extreme miniaturization is known to be detrimental for certain properties, such as ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide films below a critical thickness. Remarkably, few&#8208;layer crystalline films of monochalcogenides display robust in&#8208;plane ferroelectricity with potential applications in nanoelectronics. These applications critically depend on the electronic properties and the nature of bonding in the 2D limit. A fundamental open question is thus to what extent bulk properties persist in thin films. Here, this question is addressed by a first&#8208;principles study of the structural, electronic, and ferroelectric properties of selected monochalcogenides (GeSe, GeTe, SnSe, and SnTe) as a function of film thickness up to 18 bilayers. While in selenides a few bilayers are sufficient to recover the bulk behavior, the Te&#8208;based compounds deviate strongly from the bulk, irrespective of the slab thickness. These results are explained in terms of depolarizing fields in Te&#8208;based slabs and the different nature of the chemical bond in selenides and tellurides. It is shown that GeTe and SnTe slabs inherit metavalent bonding of the bulk phase, despite structural and electronic properties being strongly modified in thin films. This understanding of the nature of bonding in few&#8208;layers structures offers a powerful tool to tune materials properties for applications in information technology.

      <title>Lipid&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Supported 3D Printing of Human Cerebral Cortex Cells Reveals Developmental Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The human cerebral cortex contains distinguishable cell arrangements that are important for brain function. The 3D droplet printing technique reported allows the assembly of human cortical neurons and glial cells into defined patterns in extracellular matrix. The engineered human cortical tissues are functional and able to recapitulate aspects of brain development.








Abstract
Current understanding of human brain development is rudimentary due to suboptimal in vitro and animal models. In particular, how initial cell positions impact subsequent human cortical development is unclear because experimental spatial control of cortical cell arrangement is technically challenging. 3D cell printing provides a rapid customized approach for patterning. However, it has relied on materials that do not represent the extracellular matrix (ECM) of brain tissue. Therefore, in the present work, a lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;supported printing technique is developed to 3D print human cortical cells in the soft, biocompatible ECM, Matrigel. Printed human neural stem cells (hNSCs) show high viability, neural differentiation, and the formation of functional, stimulus&#8208;responsive neural networks. By using prepatterned arrangements of neurons and astrocytes, it is found that hNSC process outgrowth and migration into cell&#8208;free matrix and into astrocyte&#8208;containing matrix are similar in extent. However, astrocytes enhance the later developmental event of axon bundling. Both young and mature neurons migrate into compartments containing astrocytes; in contrast, astrocytes do not migrate into neuronal domains signifying nonreciprocal chemorepulsion. Therefore, precise prepatterning by 3D printing allows the construction of natural and unnatural patterns that yield important insights into human cerebral cortex development.

      <title>Ligand Diffusion Enables Force&#8208;Independent Cell Adhesion via Activating &#945;5&#946;1 Integrin and Initiating Rac and RhoA Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Cell adhesion and stem cell fate specification exhibit unexpected behaviors in response to ligand diffusivity. Fast ligand diffusion enables cell adhesion independent of myosin&#8208;based force generation. An atypical pathway utilizing &#945;5&#946;1 integrin, RhoA, and Rac is detected to induce cell adhesion in such situations where &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;related mechanotransduction pathways are inactive.








Abstract
Cells reside in a dynamic microenvironment in which adhesive ligand availability, density, and diffusivity are key factors regulating cellular behavior. Here, the cellular response to integrin&#8208;binding ligand dynamics by directly controlling ligand diffusivity via tunable ligand&#8211;surface interactions is investigated. Interestingly, cell spread on the surfaces with fast ligand diffusion is independent of myosin&#8208;based force generation. Fast ligand diffusion enhances &#945;5&#946;1 but not &#945;v&#946;3 integrin activation and initiates Rac and RhoA but not ROCK signaling, resulting in lamellipodium&#8208;based fast cell spreading. Meanwhile, on surfaces with immobile ligands, &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins synergistically initiate intracellular&#8208;force&#8208;based canonical mechanotransduction pathways to enhance cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. These results indicate the presence of heretofore&#8208;unrecognized pathways, distinct from canonical actomyosin&#8208;driven mechanisms, that are capable of promoting cell adhesion.

Potassium&#8208;metal anodes are extremely susceptible to dendrite growth, giving relevance to the jagged alpine topography. This drawing also explores the topical theme of spiritual connectedness at a time of physical solitude. It may be achievable through hiking alone or through writing reviews with friends.

      <title>Photodetectors: Graphdiyne&#8208;Based Flexible Photodetectors with High Responsivity and Detectivity (Adv. Mater. 23/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
A flexible photodetector based on ultrathin graphdiyne nanosheets is constructed and applied in a three&#8208;electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC)&#8208;type system to study its photoresponse behaviors. As described by Xiuwen Zhang, Jialiang Xu, Han Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001082, the prepared PDs show excellent photoresponse after bending or twisting for 1000 cycles. Moreover, the PDs exhibit pronounced long&#8208;term stability after being kept in an alkaline electrolyte for more than 1 month.

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908411, Jesper Nyg&#229;rd, Thomas Sand Jespersen, and co&#8208;workers present &#8220;shadow epitaxy&#8221;, a novel method for controlled in situ growth of patterned metal/semiconductor hybrid nanostructures. The method enables exploration of material combinations previously unaccessible for epitaxial hybrid quantum devices. When applied to conventional materials the bottom&#8208;up patterning significantly improves the electrical stability and reproducibility of quantum devices.

      <title>Chemical Separation: Finely Tuned Submicroporous Thin&#8208;Film Molecular Sieve Membranes for Highly Efficient Fluid Separations (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Novel thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size of &lt;4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions, as discussed by Ingo Pinnau and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001132. The membranes potentially lower the energy burden and improve the environmental sustainability of chemical separations, which are currently based on thermal principles and account for approximately 10&#8211;15% of the world's total energy consumption.

      <dc:description>
In article number 1908127, Cheng Zhong and co&#8208;workers report the development of an alkaline gel polymer electrolyte (GPE), which is fabricated through multiple crosslinking reactions among poly(vinyl alcohol), poly(acrylic acid), and graphene oxide followed by intense uptake of an alkali and a KI reaction modifier. This electrolyte enables the construction of zinc&#8211;air batteries that exhibit low charge potential, long working life, high energy efficiency, and excellent practicability for flexible power sources.

      <dc:description>
Optical activity of surface lattice resonances is demonstrated by Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001330. The controlled arrangement of chiral crescent&#8208;shaped nanoantennae allows a selective response of the surface lattice resonances to the handedness of incident circularly polarized light. Modified colloidal lithtography enables the fabrication of cm2&#8208;scale substrates using a self&#8208;assembled poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;silica core&#8211;shell system as particle masks.

      <title>Cancer Therapy: Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000020, Won Jong Kim and co&#8208;workers describe a reinforced natural killer (ReNK) system, adopting the formation of NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapses (IS) as a trigger for delivery of tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapeutics. NK cells are decorated with the IS environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of drug when they attack cancer cells. The strategy enables the NK cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors by efficient penetration of the delivered drug into the tumor tissue; otherwise, its penetration is hindered by the dense extracellular matrix of the tumor tissue.

      <title>Magnetic Patterning: Local Photothermal Control of Phase Transitions for On&#8208;Demand Room&#8208;Temperature Rewritable Magnetic Patterning (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Patterned magnetic nanostructures are foundational to magnetic memory and logic devices. In article number 2001080, Antonio B. Mei, Gregory D. Fuchs, and co&#8208;workers design a platform for reconfigurable magnetic nanostructures in FeRh by tuning the transition temperature from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic such that both phases are stable at room temperature. Focused laser heating is used to write ferromagnetic patterns of arbitrary shape at ultrafast speeds, which can be erased by cooling below room temperature.
