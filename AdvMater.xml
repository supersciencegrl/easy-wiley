         <title>Uniform, Fully Connected, High&#8208;Quality Monocrystalline Freestanding Perovskite Oxide Films Fabricated from Recyclable Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin freestanding oxide films are useful, yet easily fragment and consume high&#8208;cost single crystal substrates. Engineering the elastic moduli and removability of the supporting layer and using the etchant to replenish the substrate surface allows reliable, repetitive fabrication of uniform, fully connected, high&#8208;quality freestanding perovskite oxide thin films from recyclable oxide substrates.








Abstract
Releasing epitaxial perovskite oxide films from their native oxide substrates produces high quality, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;like monocrystalline freestanding oxide membranes, as potential key components for the next&#8208;generation electronic devices. Two major obstacles still limit their practical applications: macroscopic material defects (mainly cracks) that lowers uniformity and yield, and the high cost of the consumed oxide substrates. Here, a two&#8208;step film transfer method and a substrate recycling method enable repetitive fabrication of millimeter&#8208;scale, fully&#8208;connected freestanding oxide films of various chemical compositions from the same substrates; arrays of capacitor and resistor devices based on these oxides transferred on silicon indicate high uniformity, low sample&#8208;to&#8208;sample variation, and satisfactory electrical connectivity. The two&#8208;step transfer suppresses crack formation by avoiding buckling&#8208;delamination&#8208;type relaxation of epitaxial strain, and the key point to achieve substrate reuse is to remove the residual Al species bonded to the substrate surfaces. The mitigation of such long&#8208;lasting issues in freestanding oxide fabrication techniques may eventually pave roads toward future industrial&#8208;grade devices, as well as enabling many research opportunities in fundamental physics.

         <title>Large Nonhysteretic Volume Magnetostriction in a Strong and Ductile High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetostrictive materials with isotropic hysteresis&#8208;free actuation, high strength and ductility are highly desired for technological applications. However, conventional ferromagnets cannot possess these properties simultaneously. Here, a high&#8208;entropy alloy with unique nanoscale structural and magnetic heterogeneities is designed to meet this challenge, exhibiting an unprecedented combination of large nonhysteretic volume magnetostriction and excellent mechanical properties over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Rapid development of smart technologies poses a big challenge for magnetostrictive materials, which should not only permit isotropic and hysteresis&#8208;free actuation (i.e., nonhysteretic volume change) in magnetic fields, but also have high strength and high ductility. Unfortunately, the magnetostriction from self&#8208;assembly of ferromagnetic domains is volume&#8208;conserving; the volume magnetostriction from field&#8208;induced first&#8208;order phase transition has large intrinsic hysteresis; and most prototype magnetostrictive materials are intrinsically brittle. Here, a magnetic high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) Fe35Co35Al10Cr10Ni10 is reported that can rectify these challenges, exhibiting an unprecedented combination of large nonhysteretic volume magnetostriction, high tensile strength and large elongation strain, over a wide working temperature range from room temperature down to 100 K. Its exceptional properties stem from a dual&#8208;phase microstructure, where the face&#8208;centered cubic (FCC) matrix phase with nanoscale compositional and structural fluctuations can enable a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;induced transition from low&#8208;spin small&#8208;volume state to high&#8208;spin large&#8208;volume state, and the ordered body&#8208;centered cubic (BCC) B2 phase contributes to mechanical strengthening. The present findings may provide insights into designing unconventional and technologically important magnetostrictive materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights advancements in digitalizing colorimetric sensors for food safety, focusing on platforms with high commercialization potential. It explores integrating color models with sensor technologies to enhance accuracy and reliability. The review underscores the convergence of material science and digital color spaces to create smart and innovative sensor systems, offering real&#8208;time monitoring and predictive analytics to advance food safety protocols.








Abstract
Colorimetric sensors play a crucial role in promoting on&#8208;site testing, enabling the detection and/or quantification of various analytes based on changes in color. These sensors offer several advantages, such as simplicity, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and visual readouts, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including food safety and monitoring. A critical component in portable colorimetric sensors involves their integration with color models for effective analysis and interpretation of output signals. The most commonly used models include CIELAB (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage), RGB (Red, Green, Blue), and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value). This review outlines the use of color models via digitalization in sensing applications within the food safety and monitoring field. Additionally, challenges, future directions, and considerations are discussed, highlighting a significant gap in integrating a comparative analysis toward determining the color model that results in the highest sensor performance. The aim of this review is to underline the potential of this integration in mitigating the global impact of food spoilage and contamination on health and the economy, proposing a multidisciplinary approach to harness the full capabilities of colorimetric sensors in ensuring food safety.

         <title>Unveiling the Effect of Cooling Rate on Grown&#8208;in Defects Concentration in Polycrystalline Perovskite Films for Solar Cells with Improved Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The supersaturated point defects in perovskite films will generate during cooling process after annealing and its concentration improves as the cooling rate increases. These defects can be minimized through slowing the cooling rate. The resultant PSCs deliver a 25.47% PCE (certified 24.7%) and retain &gt;90% of their initial value after &gt;1100 h of operation at the maximum power point.








Abstract
Numerous efforts are devoted to reducing the defects at perovskite surface and/or grain boundary; however, the grown&#8208;in defects inside grain is rarely studied. Here, the influence of cooling rate on the point defects concentration in polycrystalline perovskite film during heat treatment processing is investigated. With the combination of theoretical and experimental studies, this work reveals that the supersaturated point defects in perovskite films generate during the cooling process and its concentration improves as the cooling rate increases. The supersaturated point defects can be minimized through slowing the cooling rate. As a result, the optimized FAPbI3 polycrystalline films achieve a superior carrier lifetime of up to 12.6 &#181;s and improved stability. The champion device delivers a 25.47% PCE (certified 24.7%) and retain 90% of their initial value after &gt;1100 h of operation at the maximum power point. These results provide a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of grown&#8208;in defects formation in polycrystalline perovskite film.

         <title>Identifying the Origin of Thermal Modulation of Exchange Bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a thermal cycling method to tune the exchange bias field (HEB) in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures by altering the interlayer distance between antiferromagnet (AFM) and ferromagnet (FM). An overview comparing the largest HEB observed in vdW AFM/FM heterostructures reported in literature along with the present study is provided, a. Over a sequence of 15 heating&#8211;cooling cycles, a five fold change in the magnitude of HEB at 5 K is observed because of a modified interface registry induced by thermal cycling, b and c.








Abstract
The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange&#8208;coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals materials, with their layered structures, offer an ideal platform for exploring exchange bias. However, effectively manipulating exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures remains challenging. This study investigates the origin of exchange bias in MnPS3/Fe3GeTe2 van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating a method to modulate nearly 1000% variation in magnitude through simple thermal cycling. Despite the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS3, a substantial 170 mT exchange bias is observed at 5 K, one of the largest observed in van der Waals heterostructures. This significant exchange bias is linked to anomalous weak ferromagnetic ordering in MnPS3 below 40 K. The tunability of exchange bias during thermal cycling is attributed to the amorphization and changes in the van der Waals gap during field cooling. The findings highlight a robust and adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures, presenting a straightforward method to enhance other interface&#8208;related spintronic phenomena for practical applications. Detailed interface analysis reveals atom migration between layers, forming amorphous regions on either side of the van der Waals gap, emphasizing the importance of precise interface characterization in these heterostructures.

&lt;p&gt;The exchange bias phenomenon, inherent in exchange-coupled ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, has intrigued researchers for decades. Van der Waals materials, with their layered structures, offer an ideal platform for exploring exchange bias. However, effectively manipulating exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures remains challenging. This study investigates the origin of exchange bias in MnPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrating a method to modulate nearly 1000% variation in magnitude through simple thermal cycling. Despite the compensated interfacial spin configuration of MnPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a substantial 170 mT exchange bias is observed at 5 K, one of the largest observed in van der Waals heterostructures. This significant exchange bias is linked to anomalous weak ferromagnetic ordering in MnPS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; below 40 K. The tunability of exchange bias during thermal cycling is attributed to the amorphization and changes in the van der Waals gap during field cooling. The findings highlight a robust and adjustable exchange bias in van der Waals heterostructures, presenting a straightforward method to enhance other interface-related spintronic phenomena for practical applications. Detailed interface analysis reveals atom migration between layers, forming amorphous regions on either side of the van der Waals gap, emphasizing the importance of precise interface characterization in these heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insulator Polymer Matrix Construction on All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Photoactive Blend Towards Extrapolated 15000 Hour T80 Stable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insulating polymer SEBS that can be stably and massively produced, is reported to be effective in forming morphology&#8208;stability&#8208;favorable matrix in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule's active layer, suppressing the degradation mainly driven by small molecular donor(s). It is finally found a potential T80 value of 15000 hours under MPPT.








Abstract
To boost the stability of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule (ASM) organic photovoltaic (OPV) blends, an insulator polymer called styrene&#8208;ethylene&#8208;butylene&#8208;styrene (SEBS) as morphology stabilizer is applied into the host system of small molecules BM&#8208;ClEH:BO&#8208;4Cl. Minor addition of SEBS (1&#160;mg/ml in host solution) provides a significantly enhanced T80 value of 15000 hours (extrapolated), surpassing doping&#8208;free (0&#160;mg/ml) and heavy doping (10&#160;mg/ml) counterparts (900 hours, 30 hours). The material reproducibility and cost&#8208;effectiveness of the active layer will not be affected by this industrially available polymer, where the power conversion efficiency (PCE) can be well maintained at 15.02%, which is still a decent value for non&#8208;halogen solvent&#8208;treated ASM OPV. Morphological and photophysical characterizations clearly demonstrate SEBS's pivotal effect on suppressing the degradation of donor molecules and blend film's crystallization/aggregation reorganization, which protects the exciton dynamics effectively. This work pays meaningful attention to the ASM system stability, performs a smart strategy to suppress the film morphology degradation, and releases a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of device performance reduction.

         <title>Programmable Chemical Reactions Enable Ultrastrong Soft Pneumatic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By integrating thermoelectric materials and preprogramming strategy into the management of reversible reactions, an soft pneumatic actuation is realized with high regulation, high pressure, and the ability to transport gas over long distances. The soft pneumatic actuation is successfully applying the programmable chemical reactions to soft assistive wearables, haptic devices, and lifting a sightseeing car.








Abstract
Soft pneumatic actuation is widely used in wearable devices, soft robots, artificial muscles, and surgery machines. However, generating high&#8208;pressure gases in a soft, controllable, and portable way remains a substantial challenge. Here, a class of programmable chemical reactions that can be used to controllably generate gases with a maximum pressure output of nearly 6&#160;MPa is reported. It is proposed to realize the programmability of the chemical reaction process using thermoelectric material with programmable electric current and employing preprogrammed reversible chemical reactants. The programmable chemical reactions as soft pneumatic actuation can be operated independently as miniature gas sources (&#8764;20&#8211;100&#160;g) or combined with arbitrary physical structures to make self&#8208;contained machines, capable of generating unprecedented pressures of nearly 6&#160;MPa or forces of about 18&#160;kN in a controllable, portable, and silent manner. Striking demonstrations of breaking a brick, a marble, and concrete blocks, raising a sightseeing car, and successful applications in artificial muscles and soft assistive wearables illustrate tremendous application prospects of soft pneumatic actuation via programmable chemical reactions. The study establishes a new paradigm toward ultrastrong soft pneumatic actuation.

         <title>Electron Spectroscopy and Microscopy: A Window into the Surface Electronic Properties of Polycrystalline Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perspective presents an overview of the array of information that can be gleaned from the characterization of single crystals of metal halide perovskites using electron spectroscopic techniques. Building on this information, the perspective then discusses the challenges that need to be addressed in order to extend these versatile techniques to include the highly heterogeneous polycrystalline perovskite thin films.








Abstract
In the past years, an increasing number of experimental techniques have emerged to address the need to unveil the chemical, structural, and electronic properties of perovskite thin films with high vertical and lateral spatial resolutions. One of these is angle&#8208;resolved photoemission electron spectroscopy which can provide direct access to the electronic band structure of perovskites, with the aim of overcoming elusive and controversial information due to the complex data interpretation of purely optical spectroscopic techniques. This perspective looks at the information that can be gleaned from the direct measurement of the electronic band structure of single crystal perovskites and the challenges that remain to be&#160;overcame to extend this technique to heterogeneous polycrystalline metal halide perovskites.

         <title>Stable Photo&#8208;Rechargeable Al Battery for Enhancing Energy Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable photo&#8208;rechargeable Al battery for integrated solar energy conversion storage is demonstrated to substantially enhance energy utilization. Illumination will generate photo&#8208;holes and electrons to improve the reaction pathway, along with boosting the electrochemical reaction. A novel strategy is designed to meet the practical operation condition within 24&#160;h, exhibiting energy saving because of decreased overpotential upon charging/discharging.









Abstract
Photovoltaic cells (PVs) are able to convert solar energy to electric energy, while energy storage devices are required to be equipped due to the fluctuations of sunlight. However, the electrical connection of PVs and energy storage devices leads to increased energy consumption, and thus energy storage ability and utilization efficiency are decreased. One of the solutions is to explore an integrated photoelectrochemical energy conversion&#8208;storage device. Up to date, the integrated photo&#8208;rechargeable Li&#8208;ion batteries often suffer from unstable photo&#8208;active materials and flammable electrolytes under illumination, with concerns in safety risks and limited lifetime. To address the critical issues, here a novel photo&#8208;rechargeable aluminum battery (PRAB) is designed with safe ionic liquid electrolytes and stable polyaniline photo&#8208;electrodes. The integrated PRAB presents stable operation with an enhanced reversible specific capacity &#8776;191% under illumination. Meanwhile, a simplified continuum model is established to provide rational guidance for designing electrode structures along with a charging/discharging strategy to meet the practical operation conditions. The as&#8208;designed PRAB presents an energy&#8208;saving efficiency &#8776;61.92% upon charging and an energy output increment &#8776;31.25% during discharging under illumination. The strategy of designing and fabricating stable and safe photo&#8208;rechargeable non&#8208;aqueous Al batteries highlights the pathway for substantially promoting the utilization efficiency of solar energy.

         <title>Truly Tiny Acoustic Biomolecules for Ultrasound Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall &#8220;bicones&#8221; are engineered from gas vesicles (GVs), a type of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructure, and produced in bacterial culture. This work develops foundational techniques for their potential applications in ultrasound imaging and therapy, including methods for detection in vitro and in vivo, cavitation, molecular targeting, immune evasion, and protein conjugation.








Abstract
Nanotechnology offers significant advantages for medical imaging and therapy, including enhanced contrast and precision targeting. However, integrating these benefits into ultrasonography is challenging due to the size and stability constraints of conventional bubble&#8208;based agents. Here bicones, truly tiny acoustic contrast agents based on gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of air&#8208;filled protein nanostructures naturally produced in buoyant microbes, are described. It is shown that these sub&#8208;80&#160;nm particles can be effectively detected both in vitro and in vivo, infiltrate tumors via leaky vasculature, deliver potent mechanical effects through ultrasound&#8208;induced inertial cavitation, and are easily engineered for molecular targeting, prolonged circulation time, and payload conjugation.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrasmall &#8220;bicones&#8221; are engineered from gas vesicles (GVs), a type of air-filled protein nanostructure, and produced in bacterial culture. This work develops foundational techniques for their potential applications in ultrasound imaging and therapy, including methods for detection in vitro and in vivo, cavitation, molecular targeting, immune evasion, and protein conjugation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology offers significant advantages for medical imaging and therapy, including enhanced contrast and precision targeting. However, integrating these benefits into ultrasonography is challenging due to the size and stability constraints of conventional bubble-based agents. Here bicones, truly tiny acoustic contrast agents based on gas vesicles (GVs), a unique class of air-filled protein nanostructures naturally produced in buoyant microbes, are described. It is shown that these sub-80&#160;nm particles can be effectively detected both in vitro and in vivo, infiltrate tumors via leaky vasculature, deliver potent mechanical effects through ultrasound-induced inertial cavitation, and are easily engineered for molecular targeting, prolonged circulation time, and payload conjugation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>50&#8208;nm Gas&#8208;Filled Protein Nanostructures to Enable the Access of Lymphatic Cells by Ultrasound Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large size of microbubbles and nanobubbles greatly limits the cell populations that ultrasound imaging and delivery can access. This article introduces genetically engineered virus&#8208;size gaseous nanostructures, representing the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles ever made to the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge. They have demonstrated the ability to penetrate deep tissues in lymph nodes.








Abstract
Ultrasound imaging and ultrasound&#8208;mediated gene and drug delivery are rapidly advancing diagnostic and therapeutic methods; however, their use is often limited by the need for microbubbles, which cannot transverse many biological barriers due to their large size. Here, the authors introduce 50&#8208;nm gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures derived from genetically engineered gas vesicles(GVs)&#160;that are referred to as 50 nmGVs. These diamond&#8208;shaped nanostructures have hydrodynamic diameters smaller than commercially available 50&#8208;nm gold nanoparticles and are, to the authors&#8217; knowledge, the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles made to date. 50 nmGVs can be produced in bacteria, purified through centrifugation, and remain stable for months. Interstitially injected 50 nmGVs can extravasate into lymphatic tissues and gain access to critical immune cell populations, and electron microscopy images of lymph node tissues reveal their subcellular location in antigen&#8208;presenting cells adjacent to lymphocytes. The authors anticipate that 50 nmGVs can substantially broaden the range of cells accessible to current ultrasound technologies and may generate applications beyond biomedicine as ultrasmall stable gas&#8208;filled nanomaterials.

         <title>Composition Dictates Octahedral Tilt and Photostability in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The long&#8208;term instability of halide perovskite semiconductors hinders their commercial adoption. In this paper, it is found that the magnitude of octahedral tilting in the crystal structures of alloyed formamidinium&#8208;rich halide perovskites can be controlled by their composition, and that greater tilting leads to more photo&#8208;stable films with fewer performance&#8208;limiting hexagonal phase impurities.








Abstract
Halide perovskites are excellent candidate materials for use in solar cell, LED, and detector devices, in part because their composition can be tuned to achieve ideal optoelectronic properties. Empirical efficiency optimization has led the field toward compositions rich in FA (formamidinium) on the A&#8208;site and I on the X&#8208;site, with additional small amounts of MA (methylammonium) or Cs A&#8208;site cations and Br X&#8208;site anions. However, it is not clear how and why the specific compositions of alloyed, that is, mixed component, halide perovskites relate to photo&#8208;stability of the materials. Here, this work combines synchrotron grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, photoluminescence, high&#8208;resolution scanning electron diffraction measurements and theoretical modelling to reveal the links between material structure and photostability. Namely, this work finds that increased octahedral titling leads to improved photo&#8208;stability that is correlated with lower densities of performance&#8208;harming hexagonal polytype impurities. These results uncover the structural signatures underpinning photo&#8208;stability and can therefore be used to make targeted changes to halide perovskites, bettering the commercial prospects of technologies based on these materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Responsive Aligned Piezoelectric Nanofibers Derived Hydrogel Conduits for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel nerve guidance conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration are proposed. The aligned piezoelectric nanofibers inner layer possesses aligned orientation and US&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation, while poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel outer layer provides controllable drug release to promote nerve regeneration. Such conduits can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve regeneration of rats with long sciatic nerve defects.








Abstract
Nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) are considered as promising treatment strategy and frontier trend for peripheral nerve regeneration, while their therapeutic outcomes are limited by the lack of controllable drug delivery and available physicochemical cues. Herein, novel aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs with ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered electrical stimulation (ES) and controllable drug release for repairing peripheral nerve injury are proposed. The inner layer of the NGCs is the barium titanate piezoelectric nanoparticles (BTNPs)&#8208;doped polyvinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene [BTNPs/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)] electrospinning nanofibers with improved piezoelectricity and aligned orientation. The outer side of the NGCs is the thermoresponsive poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hybrid hydrogel with bioactive drug encapsulation. Such NGCs can not only induce neuronal&#8208;oriented extension and promote neurite outgrowth with US&#8208;triggered wireless ES, but also realize the controllable nerve growth factor release with the hydrogel shrinkage under US&#8208;triggered heating. Thus, the NGC can positively accelerate the functional recovery and nerve axonal regeneration of rat models with long sciatic nerve defects. It is believed that the proposed US&#8208;responsive aligned piezoelectric nanofibers derived hydrogel NGCs will find important applications in clinic neural tissue engineering.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Crystalline Core&#8208;Shell Guanine Spherulites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique architecture of core&#8208;shell spherulites, composed of highly birefringent and ordered crystalline organic subunits, formed in the eyes of aquatic organisms, exhibits extraordinary light scattering properties with no synthetic equivalent. A ternary emulsification process is developed to produce bioinspired core&#8208;shell spherulites of self&#8208;assembled guanine platelets, with an estimated birefringence of &#8776;25%.








Abstract
Spherical particles with diameters within the wavelength of visible light, known as spherulites, manipulate light uniquely due to their spatial organization and their structural birefringence. Most of the known crystalline spherulites are branched, and composed of metals, alloys, and semi&#8208;crystalline polymers. Recently, a different spherulite architecture is discovered in the vision systems of decapod crustaceans &#8208; core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of highly birefringent (&#916;n&#8776;30%$\Delta n \approx \ 30\%$) organic single&#8208;crystal platelets, with exceptional optical properties. These metastructures, which efficiently scatter light even in dense aqueous environments, have no synthetic equivalence and serve as a natural proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept as well as synthetic inspiration for thin scattering media. Here, the synthesis of core&#8208;shell spherulites composed of guanine crystal platelets ((&#916;n&#8776;25%$\Delta n \approx 25\%$) is presented in a two&#8208;step emulsification process in which a water/oil/water emulsion and induced pH changes are used to promote interfacial crystallization. Carboxylic acids neutralize the dissolved guanine salts to form spherulites composed of single, radially stacked, &#946;&#8208;guanine platelets, which are oriented tangentially to the spherulite surface. Using Mie theory calculations and forward scattering measurements from single spherulites, it is found that due to the single&#8208;crystal properties and orientation, the synthetic spherulites possess a high tangential refractive index, similarly to biogenic&#160;particles.

         <title>Photoannealing of Microtissues Creates High&#8208;Density Capillary Network Containing Living Matter in a Volumetric&#8208;Independent Manner</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Clinical translation of engineered tissues is currently hindered by the lack of solutions to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks in clinically sized tissues. Photoannealing of living microtissues combines the clinically translatable microtissue production throughput of in&#8208;air microfluidics with cytocompatible photoannealing to on&#8208;demand generate living microporous tissues containing high&#8208;density capillary networks in a scalable manner.








Abstract
The vascular tree is crucial for the survival and function of large living tissues. Despite breakthroughs in 3D bioprinting to endow engineered tissues with large blood vessels, there is currently no approach to engineer high&#8208;density capillary networks into living tissues in a scalable manner. Here, photoannealing of living microtissue (PALM) is presented as a scalable strategy to engineer capillary&#8208;rich tissues. Specifically, in&#8208;air microfluidics is used to produce living microtissues composed of cell&#8208;laden microgels in ultrahigh throughput, which can be photoannealed into a monolithic living matter. Annealed microtissues inherently give rise to an open and interconnected pore network within the resulting living matter. Interestingly, utilizing soft microgels enables microgel deformation, which leads to the uniform formation of capillary&#8208;sized pores. Importantly, the ultrahigh throughput nature underlying the microtissue formation uniquely facilitates scalable production of living tissues of clinically relevant sizes (&gt;1 cm3) with an integrated high&#8208;density capillary network. In short, PALM generates monolithic, microporous, modular tissues that meet the previously unsolved need for large engineered tissues containing high&#8208;density vascular networks, which is anticipated to advance the fields of engineered organs, regenerative medicine, and drug screening.

         <title>Accumulation of Long&#8208;Lived Photogenerated Holes at Indium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts via Two Coordinate Nitrogen Vacancy Defect Engineering for Enhanced Photocatalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single&#8208;atom photocatalysts with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) defects, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), is reported to make further advances in visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalysis. The engineered two coordinated nitrogen (N2C) vacancies induce a defect state serving as an effective electron trap, thus extending the lifetime of photogenerated holes and concentrating holes at In atom sites.








Abstract
Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic oxidation by photogenerated holes has immense potential for environmental remediation applications. While the electron&#8208;mediated photoreduction reactions are often at the spotlight, active holes possess a remarkable oxidation capacity that can degrade recalcitrant organic pollutants, resulting in nontoxic byproducts. However, the random charge transfer and rapid recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs hinder the accumulation of long&#8208;lived holes at the reaction center. Herein, a novel method employing defect&#8208;engineered indium (In) single&#8208;atom photocatalysts with nitrogen vacancy (Nv) defects, dispersed in carbon nitride foam (In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF), is reported to overcome these challenges and make further advances in photocatalysis. This Nv defect&#8208;engineered strategy produces a remarkable extension in the lifetime and an increase in the concentration of photogenerated holes in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF. Consequently, the optimized In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF demonstrates a remarkable 50&#8208;fold increase in photo&#8208;oxidative degradation rate compared to pristine CN, effectively breaking down two widely used antibiotics (tetracycline and ciprofloxacin) under visible light. The contaminated water treated by In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF is completely nontoxic based on the growth of Escherichia coli. Structural&#8211;performance correlations between defect engineering and long&#8208;lived hole accumulation in In&#8208;Nv&#8208;CNF are established and validated through experimental and theoretical agreement. This work has the potential to elevate the efficiency of overall photocatalytic reactions from a hole&#8208;centric standpoint.

         <title>Enhancing the Conductivity and Thermoelectric Performance of Semicrystalline Conducting Polymers through Controlled Tie Chain Incorporation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new model system of ion&#8208;exchange doped, aligned ribbon&#8208;phase poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] (PBTTT) is reported to study the effect of controlled incorporation of tie chains between crystalline domains. The tie chains provide efficient transport pathways between crystalline domains, resulting in&#160;enhanced electrical conductivity of 4810.1 S cm&#8722;1 without a reduction in Seebeck coefficient nor a large increase in thermal conductivity.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are promising materials for thermoelectric applications, however, at present few effective and well&#8208;understood strategies exist to further advance their thermoelectric performance. Here a new model system is reported for a better understanding of the key factors governing their thermoelectric properties: aligned, ribbon&#8208;phase poly[2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;dodecylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene] (PBTTT) doped by ion&#8208;exchange doping. Using a range of microstructural and spectroscopic methods, the effect of controlled incorporation of tie&#8208;chains between the crystalline domains is studied through blending of high and low molecular weight chains. The tie chains provide efficient transport pathways between crystalline domains and lead to significantly enhanced electrical conductivity of 4810 S cm&#8722;1, which is not accompanied by a reduction in Seebeck coefficient or a large increase in thermal conductivity. Respectable power factors of 173 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 are demonstrated in this model system. The approach is generally applicable to a wide range of semicrystalline conjugated polymers and could provide an effective pathway for further enhancing their thermoelectric properties and overcome traditional trade&#8208;offs in optimization of thermoelectric performance.

         <title>3D Conjugated Hole Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D hole transporting material termed FTPE&#8208;ST is reported, which has a large conjugated structure leading to high hole mobility, and sulfur atoms that can bind to coordinately unsaturated lead centers on the surface of perovskite films, enhancing interfacial interactions. Perovskite solar cells and modules incorporating FTPE&#8208;ST achieve power conversion efficiencies of 25.21 and 21.27%, respectively.








Abstract
The orthogonal structure of the widely used hole transporting material (HTM) 2,2&#8242;,7,7&#8242;&#8208;tetrakis(N, N&#8208;di&#8208;p&#8208;methoxyphenylamino)&#8722;9,9&#8242;&#8208;spirobifluorene (Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD)&#160;imparts isotropic conductivity and excellent film&#8208;forming capability. However, inherently weak intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;molecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions result in low intrinsic hole mobility. Herein, a novel HTM, termed FTPE&#8208;ST, with a twist conjugated dibenzo(g,p)chrysene core and coplanar 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) as extended donor units, is designed to enhance &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions, without compromising on solubility. The three&#8208;dimensional (3D) configuration provides the material multi&#8208;direction charge transport as well as excellent solubility even in 2&#8208;methylanisole, and its large conjugated backbone endows the HTM with a high hole mobility. Moreover, the sulfur donors in EDOT units coordinate with lead ions on the perovskite surface, leading to stronger interfacial interactions and the suppression of defects at the perovskite/HTM interface. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing FTPE&#8208;ST achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.21% with excellent long&#8208;time stability, one of the highest PCEs for non&#8208;spiro HTMs in n&#8208;i&#8208;p PSCs. In addition, the excellent film&#8208;forming capacity of the HTM enables the fabrication of FTPE&#8208;ST&#8208;based large&#8208;scale PSCs (1.0&#160;cm2) and modules (29.0&#160;cm2), which achieve PCEs of 24.21% (certificated 24.17%) and 21.27%, respectively.

         <title>Self&#8208;Timed and Spatially Targeted Delivery of Chemical Cargo by Motile Liquid Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed hydrodynamic and colloidal forces permit motile liquid crystal (LC) droplets to transport and then release microcargo at specific times and locations. Release is triggered by an internal flow that is weak enough to permit the formation of large microcargo clusters, yet strong enough to exert hydrodynamic forces on these clusters that overcome colloidal forces and trigger escape of the LC droplets.








Abstract
A key challenge underlying the design of miniature machines is encoding materials with time&#8208; and space&#8208;specific functional behaviors that require little human intervention. Dissipative processes that drive materials beyond equilibrium and evolve continuously with time and location represent one promising strategy to achieve such complex functions. This work reports how internal nonequilibrium states of liquid crystal (LC) emulsion droplets undergoing chemotaxis can be used to time the delivery of a chemical agent to a targeted location. During ballistic motion, hydrodynamic shear forces dominate LC elastic interactions, dispersing microdroplet inclusions (microcargo) within double emulsion droplets. Scale&#8208;dependent colloidal forces then hinder the escape of dispersed microcargo from the propelling droplet. Upon arrival at the targeted location, a circulatory flow of diminished strength allows the microcargo to cluster within the LC elastic environment such that hydrodynamic forces grow to exceed colloidal forces and thus trigger the escape of the microcargo. This work illustrates the utility of the approach by using microcargo that initiate polymerization upon release through the outer interface of the carrier droplet. These findings provide a platform that utilizes nonequilibrium strategies to design autonomous spatial and temporal functions into active materials.

         <title>AMPLON: Amplifying DNA with Multiarm Priming and Looping Optimization of Nucleic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article introduces a groundbreaking method called amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. By utilizing unique multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers, AMPLON demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in nucleic acid detection. With its potential to enhance nucleic acid amplification, AMPLON holds promise for significant advancements in biotechnology, medicine and healthcare.








Abstract
Nucleic acid amplification, the bedrock of biotechnology and molecular diagnostics, surges in applications&#8212;especially isothermal approaches&#8212;heightening the demand for advanced and precisely engineered methods. Here, a novel approach for amplifying DNA with multiarm priming and looping optimization of nucleic acid (AMPLON) is presented. AMPLON relies on a novel polymeric material with unique set of multiarm polyethylene glycol&#8211;DNA primers for efficient DNA amplification under isothermal conditions. Each arm carries single&#8208;stranded DNA complementing the sense or antisense sequence of the target DNA. The amplification reaction begins with antisense arms binding to the target DNA, forming a template for sense&#8208;carrying arms to direct multiarm large DNA amplicon synthesis through successive DNA looping and unlooping steps. Using human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV&#8208;1) as a model clinical target, AMPLON exhibits high sensitivity, detecting target concentrations as low as 100 copies mL&#8722;1. Compared to a quantitative real&#8208;time polymerase chain reaction assay using sensitive primers, AMPLON reliably identifies HIV&#8208;1 RNA in plasma samples (n = 20) with a significant agreement rate of 95%. With its ability to achieve highly specific and sensitive target amplification within 30 min, AMPLON holds immense potential to transform the field of nucleic acid research and unleashing new possibilities in medicine and biotechnology.

         <title>Extraordinary Thermoelectric Properties of Topological Surface States in Quantum&#8208;Confined Cd3As2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelectric properties of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films with varying thicknesses are systematically studied. Significant enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient in quantum&#8208;confined thin films at cryogenic temperatures is observed, which is attributed to the contribution of topological surface states. The findings suggest promising applications of topological thermoelectric materials in cryogenic solid&#8208;state cooling.








Abstract
Topological insulators and semimetals have been shown to possess intriguing thermoelectric properties promising for energy harvesting and cooling applications. However, thermoelectric transport associated with the Fermi arc topological surface states on topological Dirac semimetals remains less explored. This work systematically examines thermoelectric transport in a series of topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2 thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Surprisingly, significantly enhanced Seebeck effect and anomalous Nernst effect are found at cryogenic temperatures when the Cd3As2 layer is thin. In particular, a peak Seebeck coefficient of nearly 500&#160;&#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 and a corresponding thermoelectric power factor over 30&#160;mW&#160;K&#8722;2&#160;m&#8722;1 are observed at 5&#160;K in a 25&#8208;nm&#8208;thick sample. Combining angle&#8208;dependent quantum oscillation analysis, magnetothermoelectric measurement, transport modeling, and first&#8208;principles simulation, the contributions from bulk and surface conducting channels are isolated and the unusual thermoelectric properties are attributed to the topological surface states. The analysis showcases the rich thermoelectric transport physics in quantum&#8208;confined topological Dirac semimetal thin films and suggests new routes to achieving high thermoelectric performance at cryogenic&#160;temperatures.

         <title>Mismatched Supramolecular Interactions Facilitate the Reprocessing of Super&#8208;Strong and Ultratough Thermoset Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired strategy for improving the recyclability of mechanically strong and tough thermoset elastomers is developed using mismatched supramolecular interactions to molecularly engineer the covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer network. This work produces a robust elastomer with an extraordinary multirecyclability comparable to thermoplastic materials. This work presents a novel pathway for enabling the sustainable recycling of extremely durable thermosets.








Abstract
Thermoset elastomers have been extensively applied in many fields because of their excellent mechanical strengths and durable characteristics, such as an excellent chemical resistance. However, in the context of environmental issues, the nonrecyclability of thermosets has become a major barrier to the further development of these materials. Here, a well&#8208;tailored strategy is reported to solve this problem by introducing mismatched supramolecular interactions (MMSIs) into a covalently cross&#8208;linked poly(urethane&#8208;urea) network with dynamic acylsemicarbazide moieties. The MMSIs significantly strengthen and toughen the thermoset elastomer by effectively dissipating energy and resisting external stress. In addition, the elastomer recycling efficiency is improved 2.7&#8208;fold due to the superior reversibility of the MMSIs. The optimized thermoset elastomer&#160;features outstanding characteristics, including an ultrahigh tensile strength (110.8&#160;MPa), an unprecedented tensile toughness (1245.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), as well as remarkable resistance to chemical media, creep, and damage. Most importantly, it exhibits an extraordinary multirecyclability, and the 4th recycling efficiency remains close to 100%. This scalable method promotes the development of thermosets with both high performance and excellent recyclability, thereby providing valuable guidance for addressing the issue of nonrecyclability from a molecular design standpoint.

With acid/base controls, tunable loosened/tightened nano&#8208;loops of corresponding [1]rotaxanes (i.e., [1]RA/[1]RB) can be achieved via the shuttling of macrocycles reversibly, and thus to adjust their respective white&#8208;light/cyan emissions, where the cyan emission of [1]RB is obtained due to the largest conformational constraint of DPAC moiety in its bending form of [1]RB with a tightened lasso structure. Additionally, the non&#8208;interlocked analog M&#8208;Boc only shows the orange emission, revealing the twisted form of DPAC fluorophore in M&#8208;Boc without any conformational constraint. Moreover, the utilization of solvents (with different viscosities and polarities), temperatures, and water fractions could serve as effective tools to adjust the bi&#8208;stable vibration&#8208;induced emission (VIE) colors of [1]rotaxanes. Finally, tuning ratiometric emission colors of adaptive conformations of DPAC moieties by altering nano&#8208;bending structures in [1]rotaxanes and external stimuli can be further developed as intelligent temperature and viscosity sensor materials.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Assembly of Atomically&#8208;Precise Copper Nanoclusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically&#8208;precise copper nanoclusters are designed for intricate non&#8208;equilibrium assemblies to create life&#8208;like systems. Cu(I)&#8211;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8211;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization into equilibrium complexes. Upon adding fuels, the system goes further cycles. Metallosupramolecules offer a new toolbox for crafting nuanced non&#8208;equilibrium materials with tailored structures and functionalities.








Abstract
Accurate structure control in dissipative assemblies (DSAs) is vital for precise biological functions. However, accuracy and functionality of artificial DSAs are far from this objective. Herein, a novel approach is introduced by harnessing complex chemical reaction networks rooted in coordination chemistry to create atomically&#8208;precise copper nanoclusters (CuNCs), specifically Cu11(&#181;9&#8208;Cl)(&#181;3&#8208;Cl)3L6Cl (L = 4&#8208;methyl&#8208;piperazine&#8208;1&#8208;carbodithioate). Cu(I)&#8211;ligand ratio change and dynamic Cu(I)&#8211;Cu(I) metallophilic/coordination interactions enable the reorganization of CuNCs into metastable CuL2, finally converting into equilibrium [CuL&#183;Y]Cl (Y = MeCN/H2O) via Cu(I) oxidation/reorganization and ligand exchange process. Upon adding ascorbic acid (AA), the system goes further dissipative cycles. It is observed that the encapsulated/bridging halide ions exert subtle influence on the optical properties of CuNCs and topological changes of polymeric networks when integrating CuNCs as crosslink sites. CuNCs duration/switch period could be controlled by varying the ions, AA concentration, O2 pressure and pH. Cu(I)&#8208;Cu(I) metallophilic and coordination interactions provide a versatile toolbox for designing delicate life&#8208;like materials, paving the way for DSAs with precise structures and functionalities. Furthermore, CuNCs can be employed as modular units within polymers for materials mechanics or functionalization studies.

         <title>Customized Proteinaceous Nanoformulation for In Vivo Chemical Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed the functional proteinaceous nanoformulation for on&#8208;demand co&#8208;delivery of multiple pharmacological reprogramming factors, which selectively reprogram keratinocytes into myoepithelial cells and achieve de novo regeneration of functional sweat glands in vivo and in situ. This work shows the highest in vivo chemical reprogramming efficiency and offers a transgene&#8208;free and clinically adaptable approach for burn treatment with improved rehabilitation.









Abstract
Sweat gland (SwG) regeneration is crucial for the functional rehabilitation of burn patients. In vivo chemical reprogramming that harnessing the patient's own cells in damaged tissue is of substantial interest to regenerate organs endogenously by pharmacological manipulation, which could compensate for tissue loss in devastating diseases and injuries, for example, burns. However, achieving in vivo chemical reprogramming is challenging due to the low reprogramming efficiency and an unfavorable tissue environment. Herein, this work has developed a functionalized proteinaceous nanoformulation delivery system containing prefabricated epidermal growth factor structure for on&#8208;demand delivery of a cocktail of seven SwG reprogramming components to the dermal site. Such a chemical reprogramming system can efficiently induce the conversion of epidermal keratinocytes&#160;into SwG myoepithelial cells, resulting in successful in situ regeneration of functional SwGs. Notably, in vivo chemical reprogramming of SwGs is achieved for the first time with an impressive efficiency of 30.6%, surpassing previously reported efficiencies. Overall, this proteinaceous nanoformulation provides a platform for coordinating the target delivery of multiple pharmacological agents and facilitating in vivo SwG reprogramming by chemicals. This advancement greatly improves the clinical accessibility of in vivo reprogramming and offers a non&#8208;surgical, non&#8208;viral, and cell&#8208;free strategy for in situ SwG regeneration.

         <title>Phase Evolution of Multi&#8208;Metal Dichalcogenides With Conversion&#8208;Alloying Hybrid Mechanism for Superior Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide anode, with a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid mechanism, is introduced in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for the first time. It undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution upon cycling, leading to the formation of abundant heterojunctions and highly conductive metal/alloy phases. This significantly increases lithium storage sites and promotes charge transport, contributing to excellent low&#8208;temperature capability and overall electrochemical performance.









Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) anodes, whether intercalation&#8208;type like graphite or alloying&#8208;type like silicon, employing a single lithium storage mechanism, are often limited by modest capacity or substantial volume changes. Here, the kesterite multi&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (CZTSSe) is introduced as an anode material that harnesses a conversion&#8208;alloying hybrid lithium storage mechanism. Results unveil that during the charge&#8211;discharge processes, the CZTSSe undergoes a comprehensive phase evolution, transitioning from kesterite structure to multiple dominant phases of sulfides, selenides, metals, and alloys. The involvement of multi&#8208;components facilitates electron transport and mitigates swelling stress; meanwhile, it results in formation of abundant defects and heterojunctions, allowing for increased lithium storage active sites and reduced lithium diffusion barrier. The CZTSSe delivers a high specific capacity of up to 2266&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1; while, maintaining a stable output of 116&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 A g&#8722;1. It also demonstrates remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance, retaining 987&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 even after 600 cycles at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. When employed in full cells, a high specific energy of 562&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved, rivalling many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art LIBs. This research offers valuable insights into the design of LIB electrodes leveraging multiple lithium storage mechanisms.

         <title>Accelerated Engineering of ELP&#8208;Based Materials through Hybrid Biomimetic&#8208;De Novo Predictive Molecular Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a novel hybrid biomimetic design using elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs), this study accelerates de novo protein material engineering. This work combines computational modeling, deep learning, and genetic engineering to create ELP variants that maintain structural integrity and demonstrate controllable self&#8208;assembly. This method offers a versatile template for the design of novel structural proteins and broadening their applications.








Abstract
Efforts to engineer high&#8208;performance protein&#8208;based materials inspired by nature have mostly focused on altering naturally occurring sequences to confer the desired functionalities, whereas de novo design lags significantly behind and calls for unconventional innovative approaches. Here, using partially disordered elastin&#8208;like polypeptides (ELPs) as initial building blocks this work shows that de novo engineering of protein materials can be accelerated through hybrid biomimetic design, which this work achieves by integrating computational modeling, deep neural network, and recombinant DNA technology. This generalizable approach involves incorporating a series of de novo&#8208;designed sequences with &#945;&#8208;helical conformation and genetically encoding them into biologically inspired intrinsically disordered repeating motifs. The new ELP variants maintain structural conformation and showed tunable supramolecular self&#8208;assembly out of thermal equilibrium with phase behavior in vitro. This work illustrates the effective translation of the predicted molecular designs in structural and functional materials. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad range of partially disordered biomacromolecules and potentially pave the way toward the discovery of novel structural proteins.

         <title>Single&#8208;Step Control of Liquid&#8211;Liquid Crystalline Phase Separation by Depletion Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Different sizes of nanoparticles with concentration gradients control the liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) speed and induce different morphologies of tactoids with positional order. Nanoparticles can be templated by LLCPS via size selectivity effects inside and on the surface of tactoids, enabling unprecedented spatial characterization of the structure of the tactoids.








Abstract
Fine&#8208;tuning nucleation and growth of colloidal liquid crystalline (LC) droplets, also known as tactoids, is highly desirable in both fundamental science and technological applications. However, the tactoid structure results from the trade&#8208;off between thermodynamics and nonequilibrium kinetics effects, and controlling liquid&#8211;liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) in these systems is still a work in progress. Here, a single&#8208;step strategy is introduced to obtain a rich palette of morphologies for tactoids formed via nucleation and growth within an initially isotropic phase exposed to a gradient of depletants. The simultaneous appearance is shown of rich LC structures along the depleting potential gradient, where the position of each LC structure is correlated with the magnitude of the depleting potential. Changing the size (nanoparticles) or the nature (polymers) of the depleting agent provides additional, precise control over the resulting LC structures through a size&#8208;selective mechanism, where the depletant may be found both within and outside the LC droplets. The use of depletion gradients from depletants of varying sizes and nature offers a powerful toolbox for manipulation, templating, imaging, and understanding heterogeneous colloidal LC structures.

         <title>Seeding Atomic Silver into Internal Lattice Sites of Transition Metal Oxide for Advanced Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates how the internal lattice sites of transition metal oxide, more specifically, MnO2, can be utilized for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) by accommodating atomic Ag catalysts within its sub&#8208;nanoscale tunnel space. A dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst featuring faceted Ag nanoparticles on MnO2 surface and atomic Ag strings within MnO2 tunnels is thus designed with high eCO2RR performance.








Abstract
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close&#8208;packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel&#8208;structured MnO2, this study demonstrates how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface&#8208;only loading, via which a dual&#8208;form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice&#8208;sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub&#8208;nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual&#8208;form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3&#160;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and durability (&#8776;48&#160;h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual&#8208;form catalyst featuring facet&#8208;dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice&#8208;confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst&#8211;substrate configuration.

         <title>Vacancy&#8208;Driven High&#8208;Performance Metabolic Assay for Diagnosis and Therapeutic Evaluation of Depression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance platform based on vacancy&#8208;engineered Co3O4 for rapid diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression is developed. The vacancy&#8208;engineered nanoparticles enable up to 20&#8208;fold signal amplification compared to commercial products, featured by superior photoelectric response and photothermal properties. This platform achieves superior diagnostic performance for depression (AUC: 0.941&#8211;0.980; Accuracy: 92%&#8722;94%), driving progress in advanced matrices toward precision medicine.








Abstract
Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses and is a well&#8208;known risk factor for suicide, characterized by low overall efficacy (&lt;50%) and high relapse rate (40%). A rapid and objective approach for screening and prognosis of depression is highly desirable but still awaits further development. Herein, a high&#8208;performance metabolite&#8208;based assay to aid the diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation of depression by developing a vacancy&#8208;engineered cobalt oxide (Vo&#8208;Co3O4) assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometer platform is presented. The easy&#8208;prepared nanoparticles with optimal vacancy achieve a considerable signal enhancement, characterized by favorable charge transfer and increased photothermal conversion. The optimized Vo&#8208;Co3O4 allows for a direct and robust record of plasma metabolic fingerprints (PMFs). Through machine learning of PMFs, high&#8208;performance depression diagnosis is achieved, with the areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.941&#8211;0.980 and an accuracy of over 92%. Furthermore, a simplified diagnostic panel for depression is established, with a desirable AUC value of 0.933. Finally, proline levels are quantified in a follow&#8208;up cohort of depressive patients, highlighting the potential of metabolite quantification in the therapeutic evaluation of depression. This work promotes the progression of advanced matrixes and brings insights into the management of depression.

         <title>Deep Learning Prediction of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Parameters in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA) decay model is implemented and deep learning (DL) model for the prediction of kinetic coefficients is developed using the new TTA model, which DL model presented superior predictability by obtaining determination coefficient value of 0.992 and 0.999 of the TTA rate coefficient and TTA ratio.








Abstract
The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) ratio and the rate coefficient (kTT) of TTA are key factors in estimating the contribution of triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons in fluorescent TTA organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In this study, deep learning models are implemented to predict key factors from transient electroluminescence (trEL) data using new numerical equations. A new TTA model is developed that considers both polaron and exciton dynamics, enabling the distinction between prompt and delayed singlet decays with a fundamental understanding of the mechanism. In addition, deep learning models for predicting the kinetic coefficients and TTA ratio are established. After comprehensive optimization inspired by photophysics, determination coefficient values of 0.992 and 0.999 are achieved in the prediction of kTT and TTA ratio, respectively, indicating a nearly perfect prediction. The contribution of each kinetic parameter of polaron and exciton dynamics to the trEL curve is discussed using various deep&#8208;learning models.

     alt="Deep Learning Prediction of Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation Parameters in Blue Fluorescent Organic Light-Emitting Diodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advanced triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) decay model is implemented and deep learning (DL) model for the prediction of kinetic coefficients is developed using the new TTA model, which DL model presented superior predictability by obtaining determination coefficient value of 0.992 and 0.999 of the TTA rate coefficient and TTA ratio.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) ratio and the rate coefficient (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;TT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) of TTA are key factors in estimating the contribution of triplet excitons to radiative singlet excitons in fluorescent TTA organic light-emitting diodes. In this study, deep learning models are implemented to predict key factors from transient electroluminescence (trEL) data using new numerical equations. A new TTA model is developed that considers both polaron and exciton dynamics, enabling the distinction between prompt and delayed singlet decays with a fundamental understanding of the mechanism. In addition, deep learning models for predicting the kinetic coefficients and TTA ratio are established. After comprehensive optimization inspired by photophysics, determination coefficient values of 0.992 and 0.999 are achieved in the prediction of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;sub&gt;TT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and TTA ratio, respectively, indicating a nearly perfect prediction. The contribution of each kinetic parameter of polaron and exciton dynamics to the trEL curve is discussed using various deep-learning models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Venus Flytrap&#8208;Inspired Data&#8208;Center&#8208;Free Fast&#8208;Responsive Soft Robots Enabled by 2D Ni3(HITP)2 MOF and Graphite</title>

Inspired by Venus flytraps, soft robots without data centers, capable of active stimuli sensing, computing, and reacting, are presented, based on a power modulation strategy. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and Joule&#8208;heating&#8208;effect&#8208;based graphite electromechanical actuation. Soft robots with symmetrical reacting and asymmetrical reacting are also created.








Abstract
The rapid and responsive capabilities of soft robots in perceiving, assessing, and reacting to environmental stimuli are highly valuable. However, many existing soft robots, designed to mimic humans and other higher animals, often rely on data centers for the modulation of mechanoelectrical transduction and electromechanical actuation. This reliance significantly increases system complexity and time delays. Herein, drawing inspiration from Venus flytraps, a soft robot employing a power modulation strategy is presented for active stimulus reaction, eliminating the need for a data center. This robot achieves mechanoelectrical transduction through Ni3(2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene)2 (Ni3(HITP)2) metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) with an ultralow time delay (256&#160;ns) and electromechanical actuation via graphite. The Joule heating effect in graphite is effectively modulated by Ni3(HITP)2 before and after the presence of pressure, thus enabling the stimulus reaction of soft robots. As demonstrated, three soft robots are created: low&#8208;level edge tongue robots, Venus flytrap robots, and high&#8208;level nerve&#8208;center&#8208;controlled dragonfly robots. This power modulation strategy inspires designs of edge soft robots and high&#8208;level robots with a human&#8208;like effective fusion of conditioned and unconditioned reflexes.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layered Hollow Mesoporous Cuprous Oxide Nanoparticles for Double Drug Sequential Therapy of Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from cancer stem cells (CSCs), a strategy of double drug sequential therapy, i.e., one drug for differentiation therapy of CSCs and another drug for subsequent traditional therapy of non&#8208;CSCs, was proposed&#160;and then realized based on double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles in this study.








Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are one of the determinants of tumor heterogeneity and are characterized by self&#8208;renewal, high tumorigenicity, invasiveness, and resistance to various therapies. To overcome the resistance of traditional tumor therapies resulting from CSCs, a strategy of double drug sequential therapy (DDST) for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors is proposed in this study and is realized utilizing the developed double&#8208;layered hollow mesoporous cuprous oxide nanoparticles (DL&#8208;HMCONs). The high drug&#8208;loading contents of camptothecin (CPT) and all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) demonstrate that the DL&#8208;HMCON can be used as a generic drug delivery system. ATRA and CPT can be sequentially loaded in and released from CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA. The DDST mechanisms of CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA for CSC&#8208;containing tumors are demonstrated as follows: 1) the first release of ATRA from the outer layer induces differentiation from CSCs with high drug resistance to non&#8208;CSCs with low drug resistance; 2) the second release of CPT from the inner layer causes apoptosis of non&#8208;CSCs; and 3) the third release of Cu+ from DL&#8208;HMCON itself triggers the Fenton&#8208;like reaction and glutathione depletion, resulting in ferroptosis of non&#8208;CSCs. This CPT3@ATRA3@DL&#8208;HMCON@HA is verified to possess high DDST efficacy for CSC&#8208;enriched tumors with high biosafety.

         <title>Single Layer Silk and Cotton Woven Fabrics for Acoustic Emission and Active Sound Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
When coupled to a piezoelectric fiber, traditional fabrics can serve as emitters or suppressors of sound, emitting sound up to 70&#160;dB or actively reducing noise by up to 37 dB. A 130 &#181;m fabric can also serve as an active barrier to reduce vibrations on the surface of the fabric and thus attenuate transmitted sound by up to 75%.








Abstract
Whether intentionally generating acoustic waves or attempting to mitigate unwanted noise, sound control is an area of challenge and opportunity. This study investigates traditional fabrics as emitters and suppressors of sound. When attached to a single strand of a piezoelectric fiber actuator, a silk fabric emits up to 70&#160;dB of sound. Despite the complex fabric structure, vibrometer measurements reveal behavior reminiscent of a classical thin plate. Fabric pore size relative to the viscous boundary layer thickness is found&#8212;through comparative fabric analysis&#8212;to influence acoustic&#8208;emission efficiency. Sound suppression is demonstrated using two distinct mechanisms. In the first, direct acoustic interference is shown to reduce sound by up to 37 dB. The second relies on pacifying the fabric vibrations by the piezoelectric fiber, reducing the amplitude of vibration waves by 95% and attenuating the transmitted sound by up to 75%. Interestingly, this vibration&#8208;mediated suppression in principle reduces sound in an unlimited volume. It also allows the acoustic reflectivity of the fabric to be dynamically controlled, increasing by up to 68%. The sound emission and suppression efficiency of a 130 &#181;m silk fabric presents opportunities for sound control in a variety of applications ranging from apparel to transportation to architecture.

         <title>2D Free&#8208;Standing GeS1&#8722;xSex with Composition&#8208;Tunable Bandgap for Tailored Polarimetric Optoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates are grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD). Tailored polarimetric optoelectronic properties of GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based devices are achieved under the modulation of composition&#8208;dependent electronic band structure. These results verify that free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex nanoplates possess promising potential in tailored polarimetric optoelectronics and type&#8208;III heterostructure phototransistors with tunable electrical properties.








Abstract
Germanium&#8208;based monochalcogenides (i.e., GeS and GeSe) with desirable properties are promising candidates for the development of next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices. However, they are still stuck with challenges, such as relatively fixed electronic band structure, unconfigurable optoelectronic characteristics, and difficulty in achieving free&#8208;standing growth. Herein, it is demonstrated that two&#8208;dimensional (2D) free&#8208;standing GeS1&#8722;xSex (0 &#8804; x &#8804;&#8201;1) nanoplates can be grown by low&#8208;pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD), fulfilling a continuously composition&#8208;tunable optical bandgap and electronic band structure. By leveraging the synergistic effect of composition&#8208;dependent modulation and free&#8208;standing growth, GeS1&#8722;xSex&#8208;based optoelectronic devices exhibit significantly configurable hole mobility from 6.22 &#215; 10&#8722;4 to 1.24 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8315;1 and tunable responsivity from 8.6 to 311 A&#160;W&#8722;1 (635&#160;nm), as x varies from 0 to 1. Furthermore, the polarimetric sensitivity can be tailored from 4.3 (GeS0.29Se0.71) to 1.8 (GeSe) benefiting from alloy engineering. Finally, the tailored imaging capability is also demonstrated to show the application potential of GeS1&#8722;xSex alloy nanoplates. This work broadens the functionality of conventional binary materials and motivates the development of tailored polarimetric optoelectronic devices.

However, they are still stuck with challenges, such as relatively fixed electronic band structure, unconfigurable optoelectronic characteristics, and difficulty in achieving free-standing growth. Herein, it is demonstrated that two-dimensional (2D) free-standing GeS&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; (0 &#8804; x &#8804;&#8201;1) nanoplates can be grown by low-pressure rapid physical vapor deposition (LPRPVD), fulfilling a continuously composition-tunable optical bandgap and electronic band structure. By leveraging the synergistic effect of composition-dependent modulation and free-standing growth, GeS&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;-based optoelectronic devices exhibit significantly configurable hole mobility from 6.22 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.24 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and tunable responsivity from 8.6 to 311 A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (635&#160;nm), as x varies from 0 to 1. Furthermore, the polarimetric sensitivity can be tailored from 4.3 (GeS&lt;sub&gt;0.29&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;0.71&lt;/sub&gt;) to 1.8 (GeSe) benefiting from alloy engineering. Finally, the tailored imaging capability is also demonstrated to show the application potential of GeS&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; alloy nanoplates. This work broadens the functionality of conventional binary materials and motivates the development of tailored polarimetric optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailoring the Coordination Micro&#8208;Environment in Nanotraps for Efficient Platinum/Palladium Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise tailoring of the coordination micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of nanotraps specifically targeting platinum, facilitating the separation of binary platinum group metals (platinum/palladium). This advancement allows for the sequential and convenient acquisition of pure palladium outflow from a binary mixture of platinum and palladium via breakthrough experiments.








Abstract
Recovering platinum group metals from secondary resources is crucial to meet the growing demand for high&#8208;tech applications. Various techniques are explored, and adsorption using porous materials has emerged as a promising technology due to its efficient performance and environmental beingness. However, the challenge lies in effectively recovering and separating individual platinum group metals (PGMs) given their similar chemical properties. Herein, a breakthrough approach is presented by sophisticatedly tailoring the coordination micro&#8208;environment in a series of aminopyridine&#8208;based porous organic polymers, which enables the creation of platinum&#8208;specific nanotraps for efficient separation of binary PGMs (platinum/palladium). The newly synthesized POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py demonstrates record uptakes and selectivity toward platinum over palladium, with the amino groups adjacent to the pyridine moieties being vital in improving platinum binding performance. Further breakthrough experiments underline its remarkable ability to separate platinum and palladium. Spectroscopic analysis reveals that POP&#8208;o2NH2&#8208;Py offers a more favorable coordination fashion to platinum ions compared to palladium ions owing to the greater interaction between N and Pt4+ and stronger intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the amino groups and four coordinating chlorines at platinum. These findings underscore the importance of fine&#8208;tuning the coordination micro&#8208;environment of nanotraps through subtle modifications that can greatly enhance the selectivity toward the desired metal ions.

         <title>Closed Twisted Hydrogel Ribbons with Self&#8208;Sustained Motions under Static Light Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised by using identical slender muscle&#8208;like anisotropic hydrogel. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels exhibit continuous flipping and rotation under static light irradiation. The self&#8208;sustainability of hydrogel robots arises from the synergy of fast response of the gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and geometry&#8208;facilitated refresh of the light&#8208;exposed regions.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sustained motions are widespread in biological systems by harvesting energy from surrounding environments, which inspire scientists to develop autonomous soft robots. However, most&#8208;existing soft robots require dynamic heterogeneous stimuli or complex fabrication with different components. Recently, control of topological geometry has been promising to afford soft robots with physical intelligence and thus life&#8208;like motions. Reported here are a series of closed twisted ribbon robots, which exhibit self&#8208;sustained flipping and rotation under constant light irradiation. Both M&#246;bius strip and Seifert ribbon robots are devised for the first time by using an identical hydrogel, which responds to light irradiation on either side. Experiment and simulation results indicate that the self&#8208;regulated motions of the hydrogel robots are related to fast and reversible response of muscle&#8208;like gel, self&#8208;shadowing effect, and topology&#8208;facilitated refresh of light&#8208;exposed regions. The motion speeds and directions of the hydrogel robots can be tuned over a wide range. These closed twisted ribbon hydrogels are further applied to execute specific tasks in aqueous environments, such as collecting plastic balls, climbing a vertical rod, and transporting objects. This work presents new design principle for autonomous hydrogel robots by benefiting from material response and topology geometry, which may be inspirative for the robotics community.

         <title>A Highly Deficient Medium&#8208;Entropy Perovskite Ceramic for Electromagnetic Interference Shielding under Harsh Environment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy perovskite ceramic has developed as an efficient electromagnetic interference&#160;shielding material in harsh environment. The high concentration of Ti&#8208;O vacancy clusters formed under the synergistic effect of aliovalent substitution and entropy effect enables the material to serve as an bifunctional shielding material for electromagnetic wave and heat.








Abstract
Materials that can provide reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding in highly oxidative atmosphere at elevated temperature are indispensable in the fast&#8208;developing aerospace field. However, most of conductor&#8208;type EMI shielding materials such as metals can hardly withstand the high&#8208;temperature oxidation, while the conventional dielectric&#8208;type materials cannot offer sufficient shielding efficiency in gigahertz (GHz) frequencies. Here, a highly deficient medium&#8208;entropy (ME) perovskite ceramic as an efficient EMI shielding material in harsh environment, is demonstrated. The synergistic effect of entropy stabilization and aliovalent substitution on A&#8208;site generate abnormally high concentration of Ti and O vacancies that are stable under high&#8208;temperature oxidation. Due to the clustering of vacancies, the highly deficient perovskite ceramic exhibits giant complex permittivity and polarization loss in GHz, leading to the specific EMI shielding effectiveness above 30&#160;dB/mm in X&#8208;band even after 100 h of annealing at 1000&#160;&#176;C in air. Along with the low thermal conductivity, the aliovalent ME perovskite can serve as a bifunctional shielding material for applications in aircraft engines and reusable rockets.

         <title>Sensitized Triplet&#8211;Triplet Annihilation in Nanostructured Polymeric Scintillators Allows for Pulse Shape Discrimination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured polymer scintillators embedding liquid nanodomains where triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation dye capable and a triplet sensitizer are dissolved allow discriminating &#945;&#160;particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a better time response than commercial scintillators.








Abstract
Scintillating materials emit light when exposed to ionizing radiation or particles and are used for the detection of nuclear threats, medical imaging, high&#8208;energy physics, and other usages. For some of these applications, it is vital to distinguish neutrons and charged particles from &#947;&#8208;rays. This is achievable by pulse shape discrimination (PSD), a time&#8208;gated technique, which exploits that the scintillation kinetics can depend on the nature of the incident radiation. However, it proves difficult to realize efficient PSD with plastic scintillators, which have several advantages over liquid or crystalline scintillating materials, including mechanical robustness and shapeability. It is shown here that sensitive and rapid PSD is possible with nanostructured polymer scintillators that consist of a solid polymer matrix and liquid nanodomains in which an organic dye capable of triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA) is dissolved. The liquid nature of the nanodomains renders TTA highly efficient so that delayed fluorescence can occur at low energy density. The nanostructured polymer scintillators allow discriminating &#945; particles, neutrons, and &#947;&#8208;rays with a time response that is better than that of commercial scintillators. Exploiting that the liquid nanodomains can facilitate energy transfer processes otherwise difficult to realize in solid polymers, an auxiliary triplet sensitizer is incorporated. This approach further increases the scintillator's sensitivity toward &#945; particles and neutrons and other high&#8208;energy processes where localized interactions are involved.

         <title>Formation of 2D Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Enabled by Mo2C Clusters Loaded Carbon Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel concept of trending a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure is first proposed by using a leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C cluster (Mo2C@LCS) as a sulfur host. It is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfides deposition and decomposition.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries, operated through the interconversion between sulfur and solid&#8208;state lithium sulfide, are regarded as next&#8208;generation energy storage systems. However, the sluggish kinetics of lithium sulfide deposition/dissolution, caused by its insoluble and insulated nature, hampers the practical use of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, leaf&#8208;like carbon scaffold (LCS) with the modification of Mo2C clusters (Mo2C@LCS) is reported as host material of sulfur powder. During cycles, the dissociative Mo ions at the Mo2C@LCS/electrolyte interface are detected to exhibit competitive binding energy with Li ions for lithium sulfide anions, which disrupts the deposition behavior of crystalline lithium sulfide and trends a shift in the configuration of lithium sulfide toward an amorphous structure. Combining the related electrochemical study and first&#8208;principle calculation, it is revealed that the formation of amorphous lithium sulfides shows significantly improved kinetics for lithium sulfide deposition and decomposition. As a result, the obtained Mo2C@LCS/S cathode shows an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.015% per cycle at a high mass loading of 9.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 after 700 cycles. More strikingly, an ultrahigh sulfur loading of 61.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can also be achieved. This work defines an efficacious strategy to advance the commercialization of Mo2C@LCS host for Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Polarization Saturation in Multilayered Interfacial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that rhombohedral layers of binary compounds exhibit polarization saturation beyond a critical stack thickness. The underlying saturation mechanism points to a purely electronic redistribution involving bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.








Abstract
Van der Waals polytypes of broken inversion and mirror symmetries &#160;have been recently shown to exhibit switchable electric polarization even at the ultimate two&#8208;layer thin limit. Their out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization has been found to accumulate in a ladder&#8208;like fashion with each successive layer, offering 2D building blocks for the bottom&#8208;up construction of 3D ferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated experimentally that beyond a critical stack thickness, the accumulated polarization in rhombohedral polytypes of molybdenum disulfide saturates. The underlying saturation mechanism, deciphered via density functional theory and self&#8208;consistent Poisson&#8211;Schr&#246;dinger calculations, point to a purely electronic redistribution involving: 1.&#160;Polarization&#8208;induced bandgap closure that allows for cross&#8208;stack charge transfer and the emergence of free surface charge; 2. Reduction of the polarization saturation value, as well as the critical thickness at which it is obtained, by the presence of free carriers. The resilience of polar layered structures to atomic surface reconstruction, which is essentially unavoidable in polar 3D crystals, potentially allows for the design of new devices with mobile surface charges. The findings, which are of general nature, should be accounted for when designing switching and/or conductive devices based on ferroelectric layered materials.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Centric MOCVD Enabled Synthetic Approaches for Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Tin Selenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With phase&#8208;tailored synthetic strategies, wafer&#8208;scale production of tin selenides in the 2D limit is achieved via a low&#8208;temperature metal&#8208;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) process. Directly grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 exhibits outstanding crystallinity and tunable thickness, and SnSe, which has intrinsic limitations for 2D film growth, can be prepared via a phase transition, thereby retaining all of the advantages in the MOCVD&#8208;grown product.








Abstract
Following an initial nucleation stage at the flake level, atomically thin film growth of a van der Waals material is promoted by ultrafast lateral growth and prohibited vertical growth. To produce these highly anisotropic films, synthetic or post&#8208;synthetic modifications are required, or even a combination of both, to ensure large&#8208;area, pure&#8208;phase, and low&#8208;temperature deposition. A set of synthetic strategies is hereby presented to selectively produce wafer&#8208;scale tin selenides, SnSex (both x&#160;=&#160;1 and 2), in the 2D forms. The 2D&#8208;SnSe2 films with tuneable thicknesses are directly grown via metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) at 200&#160;&#176;C, and they exhibit outstanding crystallinities and phase homogeneities and consistent film thickness across the entire wafer. This is enabled by excellent control of the volatile metal&#8211;organic precursors and decoupled dual&#8208;temperature regimes for high&#8208;temperature ligand cracking and low&#8208;temperature growth. In contrast, SnSe, which intrinsically inhibited from 2D growth, is indirectly prepared by a thermally driven phase transition of an as&#8208;grown 2D&#8208;SnSe2 film with all the benefits of the MOCVD technique. It is accompanied by the electronic n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type crossover at the wafer scale. These tailor&#8208;made synthetic routes will accelerate the low&#8208;thermal&#8208;budget production of multiphase 2D materials in a reliable and scalable fashion.

         <title>Strong Interaction between Titanium Carbonitride Embedded in Mesoporous Carbon Nanofibers and Pt Enables Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are developed as alternative support materials for electrochemical reactions. Benefiting from internal interpenetrating conductive pathways within the one&#8208;dimensional m&#8208;TiCN NFs and the strong interaction between m&#8208;TiCN NFs and platinum (Pt), m&#8208;TiCN NFs&#8208;supported Pt catalysts show superior durability in both rotating disk electrode and fuel cell tests.








Abstract
Platinum (Pt) supported on high surface area carbon has been the most widely used electrocatalyst in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). However, conventional carbon supports are susceptible to corrosion at high potentials, leading to severe degradation of electrochemical performance. In this work, titanium carbonitride embedded in mesoporous carbon nanofibers (m&#8208;TiCN NFs) are reported as a promising alternative to address this issue. Benefiting from the interpenetrating conductive pathways inside the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) nanostructures and the embedded TiCN nanoparticles (NPs), m&#8208;TiCN NFs exhibit excellent stability at high potentials and interact strongly with Pt NPs. Subsequently, m&#8208;TiCN NFs&#8208;supported Pt NPs deliver remarkably enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity and durability, with negligible activity decay and less than 5% loss of electrochemical surface area&#65288;ECSA&#65289; after 50&#160;000 cycles. Moreover, the fuel cell assembled by this catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 1.22&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and merely 3% loss after 30&#160;000 cycles of accelerated durability tests under U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) protocols. The improved ORR activity and durability are attributed to the superior corrosion resistance of the m&#8208;TiCN NF support and the strong interaction between Pt and m&#8208;TiCN NFs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a thermally stabilized triboelectric basalt textile capable of operating in an ultra&#8208;wide temperature range of &#8722;196&#160;&#176;C to 520&#160;&#176;C. Applications of wearable extreme temperature alarms and self&#8208;powered temperature recognition are demonstrated under extreme cold and hot environments, showing their possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.








Abstract
With the continuous upsurge in demand for wearable energy, nanogenerators are increasingly required to operate under extreme environmental conditions. Even though they are at the cutting edge of technology, nanogenerators have difficulty producing high&#8208;quality electrical output at very extreme temperatures. Here, a triboelectric basalt textile (TBT) with an ultrawide operational temperature range (from &#8722;196 to 520&#160;&#176;C) is created employing basalt material as the main body. The output power density of the TBT, in contrast to most conventional nanogenerators, would counterintuitively rise by 2.3 times to 740.6&#160;mW m&#8722;2 after heating to 100&#160;&#176;C because the high temperature will enhance the material's interface polarization and electronic kinetic energy. The TBT retains &#8776;55% of its initial electrical output even after heating in the flame of an alcohol lamp (520&#160;&#176;C). Surprisingly, the TBTs output voltage may retain over 85% of its initial value even after submerging in liquid nitrogen. The TBTs exceptional resistance to heat and cold indicates its possible use in high and low latitudes, high altitudes, deserts, and even space settings.

         <title>Bisphosphonate&#8208;Anchored Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules with Larger Dipole Moments for Efficient Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with Excellent Stability</title>

         <dc:description>
In order to obtain self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) with good wettability, adsorbability, and compactness, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs are designed and synthesized with different dipole moments, namely IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3. The inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibited a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for PSCs based on multipodal SAMs.








Abstract
In the fabrication of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the wettability, adsorbability, and compactness of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on conductive substrates have critical impacts on the quality of the perovskite films and the defects at the buried perovskite&#8208;substrate interface, which control the efficiency and stability of the devices. Herein, three bisphosphonate&#8208;anchored indolocarbazole (IDCz)&#8208;derived SAMs, IDCz&#8208;1, IDCz&#8208;2, and IDCz&#8208;3, are designed and synthesized by modulating the position of the two nitrogen atoms of the IDCz unit to improve the molecular dipole moments and strengthen the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Regulating the work functions (WF) of FTO electrodes through molecular dipole moments and energy levels, the perovskite band bends upwards with a small offset for ITO/IDCz&#8208;3/perovskite, thereby promoting hole extraction and blocking electrons. As a result, the inverted PSC employing IDCz&#8208;3 as hole&#8208;collecting layer exhibits a champion PCE of 25.15%, which is a record efficiency for the multipodal SAMs&#8208;based PSCs. Moreover, the unencapsulated device with IDCz&#8208;3 can be stored for at least 1800 h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Inhibiting Residual Solvent Induced Side Reactions in Vinylidene Fluoride&#8208;Based Polymer Electrolytes Enables Ultra&#8208;Stable Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The side reactions by the residual solvents of VDF&#8208;based SPE with the lithium (Li) metal induce poor stability, which has been long neglected. In this study, a strategy is developed to suppress the side interfacial reactions between the residual solvent and electrodes using a fluorinated solvent, FDMA, for a PVHF&#8208;based SPE. This study offers valuable insights into developing advanced VDF&#8208;based SPEs for enhanced lithium metal battery performance and longevity.








Abstract
Residual solvents in vinylidene fluoride (VDF)&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have been recognized as responsible for their high ionic conductivity. However, side reactions by the residual solvents with the lithium (Li) metal induce poor stability, which has been long neglected. This study proposes a strategy to achieve a delicate equilibrium between ion conduction and electrode stability for VDF&#8208;based SPEs. Specifically, 2,2,2&#8208;trifluoro&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylacetamide (FDMA) is developed as the nonside reaction solvent for poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVHF)&#8208;based SPEs, achieving both high ionic conductivity and significantly improved electrochemical stability. The developed FDMA solvent fosters the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) through interface reactions with Li metal, effectively mitigating side reactions and dendrite growth on the Li metal electrode. Consequently, the Li||Li symmetric cells and Li||LiFePO4 cells demonstrate excellent cycling performance, even under limited Li (20&#160;&#181;m thick) supply and high&#8208;loading cathodes (&gt;10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, capacity &gt;1 mAh cm&#8722;2) conditions. The stable Li||LiCoO2 cells operation with a cutoff voltage of 4.48&#160;V indicates the high&#8208;voltage stability of the developed SPE. This study offers valuable insights into the development of advanced VDF&#8208;based SPEs for enhanced lithium metal battery performance and longevity.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Hydrogels with Structural and Fluorescent Colors toward Multistage Secure Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rigid self&#8208;assembled lamellar structures provide restricted domains wherein flexible hydrogels are interspersed to form structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer as a complex site coordinates with lanthanide metal ions resulting multiple fluorescent colors. This resultant dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors has the potential to be used as multistage information encryption.








Abstract
Constructing an anti&#8208;counterfeiting material with non&#8208;interference dual optical modes is an effective way to improve information security. However, it remains challenging to achieve multistage secure information encryption due to the limited stimulus responsiveness and color tunability of the current dual&#8208;mode materials. Herein, a dual&#8208;mode hydrogel with both independently tunable structural and fluorescent colors toward multistage information encryption, is reported. In this hydrogel system, the rigid lamellar structure of poly(dodecylglyceryl itaconate) (pDGI) formed by shear flow&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly provides the restricted domains wherein monomers undergo polymerization to form a hydrogel network, producing structural color. The introduction of fluorescent monomer 6&#8208;acrylamidopicolinate (6APA) as a complexation site provides the possibility of fluorescent color formation. The hydrogel's angle&#8208;dependent structural color can be controlled by adjusting the crosslinking density and water content. Additionally, the fluorescence color can be modulated by adjusting the ratio of lanthanide ions. Information of dual&#8208;mode can be displayed separately in different channels and synergistically overlayed to read the ultimate message. Thus, a multistage information encryption system based on this hydrogel is devised through the programed decryption process. This strategy holds tremendous potential as a platform for encrypting and safeguarding valuable and authentic information in the field of anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>Acoustic Metagrating Holograms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D space is studied. Through this analysis, a series of holograms generated by dual&#8208;layer acoustic metagratings is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently.








Abstract
Metasurface holograms represent a common category of metasurface devices that utilize in&#8208;plane phase gradients to shape wavefronts, forming holographic images through the application of the generalized Snell's law (GSL). While conventional metasurfaces focus solely on phase gradients, metagratings, which incorporate higher&#8208;order wave diffraction, further expand the GSL's generality. Recent advances in certain acoustic metagratings demonstrate an updated GSL extension capable of reversing anomalous transmission and reflection, whose reversal is characterized by the parity of the number of wave propagation trips through the metagrating. However, the current extension of GSL remains limited to 1D metagratings, unable to access 2D holographic images in 3D spaces. Here, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D spaces is investigated. Through this analysis, a series of acoustic metagrating holograms is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently.

     alt="Acoustic Metagrating Holograms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D space is studied. Through this analysis, a series of holograms generated by dual-layer acoustic metagratings is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metasurface holograms represent a common category of metasurface devices that utilize in-plane phase gradients to shape wavefronts, forming holographic images through the application of the generalized Snell's law (GSL). While conventional metasurfaces focus solely on phase gradients, metagratings, which incorporate higher-order wave diffraction, further expand the GSL's generality. Recent advances in certain acoustic metagratings demonstrate an updated GSL extension capable of reversing anomalous transmission and reflection, whose reversal is characterized by the parity of the number of wave propagation trips through the metagrating. However, the current extension of GSL remains limited to 1D metagratings, unable to access 2D holographic images in 3D spaces. Here, the GSL extension to 2D metagratings for manipulating waves within 3D spaces is investigated. Through this analysis, a series of acoustic metagrating holograms is experimentally demonstrated. These holographic images exhibit the unique ability to switch between transmission and reflection types independently. This study introduces an additional dimension to modern holography design and metasurface wavefront manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W at Interfaces of Phase&#8208;Mixed Cobalt Selenide via Spontaneous Phase Transition for Platinum&#8208;Like Hydrogen Evolution Activity and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>

W doping induces a spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2. The nanoflower&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst benefits from Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species formed on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side of the phase interface and abundant phase interfaces, exhibiting Pt&#8208;like HER activity and outstanding stability in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Cost&#8208;effective transition metal chalcogenides are highly promising electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). However, unsatisfactory HER kinetics and stability have severely hindered their applications in industrial water electrolysis. Herein, a nanoflowers&#8208;shaped W&#8208;doped cubic/orthorhombic phase&#8208;mixed CoSe2 catalyst ((c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W) is reported. The W doping induces spontaneous phase transition from stable phase cubic CoSe2 (c&#8208;CoSe2) to metastable phase orthorhombic CoSe2, which not only enables precise regulation of the ratio of two phases but also realizes W doping at the interfaces of two phases. The (c/o)&#8208;CoSe2&#8208;W catalyst exhibits a Pt&#8208;like HER activity in both alkaline and acidic media, with record&#8208;low HER overpotentials of 29.8&#160;mV (alkaline) and 35.9&#160;mV (acidic) at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, surpassing the vast majority of previously reported non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for both alkaline and acidic HER. The Pt&#8208;like HER activities originate from the formation of Co&#8211;Se&#8211;W active species on the c&#8208;CoSe2 side at the phase interface, which effectively modulates electron structures of active sites, not only enhancing H2O adsorption and dissociation at Co sites but also optimizing H* adsorption to &#916;GH*&#160;&#8776;&#160;0 at W sites. Benefiting from the abundant phase interfaces, the catalyst also displays outstanding long&#8208;term durability in both acidic and alkaline media.

         <title>Co&#8208;Assembled Nanoparticles toward Multi&#8208;Target Combinational Therapy of Alzheimer's Disease by Making Full Use of Molecular Recognition and Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein a novel supramolecular integration strategy based on molecular recognition and self&#8208;assembly is proposed for the multi&#8208;target combinational therapy of Alzheimer's disease, and its feasibility and tunability are validated taking the combination of &#946;&#8208;amyloid fibrillization and oxidative stress as the representative in this work, which provides a convenient platform for constructing such multifunctional integrated system toward complex disease treatment.








Abstract
The complex pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) severely limit the effectiveness of single&#8208;target pharmic interventions, thus necessitating multi&#8208;pronged therapeutic strategies. While flexibility is essentially demanded in constructing such multi&#8208;target systems, for achieving optimal synergies and also accommodating the inherent heterogeneity within AD. Utilizing the dynamic reversibility of supramolecular strategy for conferring sufficient tunability in component substitution and proportion adjustment, amphiphilic calixarenes are poised to be a privileged molecular tool for facilely achieving function integration. Herein, taking &#946;&#8208;amyloid (A&#946;) fibrillation and oxidative stress as model combination pattern, a supramolecular multifunctional integration is proposed by co&#8208;assembling guanidinium&#8208;modified calixarene with ascorbyl palmitate and loading dipotassium phytate within calixarene cavity. Serial pivotal events can be simultaneously addressed by this versatile system, including 1) inhibition of A&#946; production and aggregation, 2) disintegration of A&#946; fibrils, 3) acceleration of A&#946; metabolic clearance, and 4) regulation of oxidative stress, which is verified to significantly ameliorate the cognitive impairment of 5&#215;FAD mice, with reduced A&#946; plaque content, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. Confronted with the extremely intricate clinical realities of AD, the strategy presented here exhibits ample adaptability for necessary alterations on combinations, thereby may immensely expedite the advancement of AD combinational therapy through providing an exceptionally convenient platform.

         <title>In Situ Ions Induced Formation of KxF&#8208;Rich SEI Layers toward Ultrastable Life of Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to induce the F&#8208;containing solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers in potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). Due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. The &#8220;self&#8208;induced formation&#8221; of F&#8208;rich SEI layers guarantees the excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability of KIBs.








Abstract
Engineering F&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers is regarded as an effective strategy to enable the long&#8208;term cycling stability of potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). However, in the conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolytes, it is challenging to form F&#8208;containing SEI layers due to the inability of KPF6 to decompose into KxF. Herein, AlCl3 is employed as a novel additive to change the chemical environment of the KPF6 carbonate electrolyte. First, due to the large charge&#8208;to&#8208;radius ratio of Al3+, the Al&#8208;containing groups in the electrolyte can easily capture F from PF6&#8722; and accelerate the formation of KxF in SEI layer. In addition, AlCl3 also reacts with trace H2O or solvents in the electrolytes to form Al2O3, which can further act as a HF scavenger. Upon incorporating AlCl3 into conventional KPF6 carbonate electrolyte, the hard carbon (HC) anode exhibits an ultra&#8208;long lifespan of 10000 cycles with a high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;100%. When coupled with perylene&#8208;3,4,9,10&#8208;tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA), the full cell exhibits a high capacity retention of 81% after 360 cycles&#8208;significantly outperforming cells using conventional electrolytes. This research paves new avenues for advancing electrolyte engineering towards developing durable batteries tailored for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

Entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly empowers the creation of highly ordered lamellar organic&#8211;inorganic supramolecular nanocomposite films, which display remarkably enhanced performance compared to unstructured composites when employed for electrostatic energy storage. This work highlights the central role of oriented nanoparticle&#8208;rich lamella in manipulating dielectric properties and electrostatic energy storage performance, offering a design concept for exploiting high&#8208;energy&#8208;density polymer nanocomposite films.








Abstract
Composite materials comprising polymers and inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) are promising for energy storage applications, though challenges in controlling NP dispersion often result in performance bottlenecks. Realizing nanocomposites with controlled NP locations and distributions within polymer microdomains is highly desirable for improving energy storage capabilities but is a persistent challenge, impeding the in&#8208;depth understanding of the structure&#8211;performance relationship. In this study, a facile entropy&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly approach is employed to fabricate block copolymer&#8208;based supramolecular nanocomposite films with highly ordered lamellar structures, which are then used in electrostatic film capacitors. The oriented interfacial barriers and well&#8208;distributed inorganic NPs within the self&#8208;assembled multilaminate nanocomposites effectively suppress leakage current and mitigate the risk of breakdown, showing superior dielectric strength compared to their disordered counterparts. Consequently, the lamellar nanocomposite films with optimized composition exhibit high energy efficiency (&gt;90% at 650&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1), along with remarkable energy density and power density. Moreover, finite element simulations and statistical modeling have provided theoretical insights into the impact of the lamellar structure on electrical conduction, electric field distribution, and electrical tree propagation. This work marks a significant advancement in the design of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrids for energy storage, establishing a well&#8208;defined correlation between microstructure and performance.

         <title>Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Colloidal QD Photodetector with Nanosecond Response Times Enabled by Ultrathin Absorber Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The record 4 ns response time in colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) that operate at short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) wavelengths is reported, the first result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging.








Abstract
Ultrafast short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) photodetection is of great interest for emerging automated vision and spatial mapping technologies. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) stand out for SWIR photodetection compared to epitaxial (In,Ga)As or (Hg,Cd)Te semiconductors by their combining a size&#8208;tunable bandgap and a suitability for cost&#8208;effective, solution&#8208;based processing. However, achieving ultrafast, nanosecond&#8208;level response time has remained an outstanding challenge for QD&#8208;based SWIR photodiodes (QDPDs). Here, record 4&#160;ns response time in PbS&#8208;based QDPDs that operate at SWIR wavelengths is reported, a result reaching the requirement of SWIR light detection and ranging based on colloidal QDs. These ultrafast QDPDs combine a thin active layer to reduce the carrier transport time and a small area to inhibit slow capacitive discharging. By implementing a concentration gradient ligand exchange method, high&#8208;quality p&#8211;n junctions are fabricated in these ultrathin QDPDs. Moreover, these ultrathin QDPDs attain an external quantum efficiency of 42% at 1330&#160;nm, due to a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced light absorption through the formation of a Fabry&#8211;Perot cavity within the QDPD and the highly efficient extraction (98%) of photogenerated charge carriers. Based on these results, it is estimated that a further increase of the charge&#8208;carrier mobility can lead to PbS QDPDs with sub&#8208;nanosecond response time.

         <title>Donor&#8211;Acceptor Modulating of Ionic AIE Photosensitizers for Enhanced ROS Generation and NIR&#8208;II Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation induced emission photosensitizer, DTP&#8208;In, is constructed with strong dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) donor and indolium (In) acceptor, achieving redshift in absorption and emission wavelength and enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate simultaneously. DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble into positively charged nanoaggregates in aqueous solutions and specifically target to the mitochondria, leading to enhanced photodynamic therapy effect under 660 nm laser irradiation.








Abstract
Photosensitizers (PSs) with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics are competitive candidates for bioimaging and therapeutic applications. However, their short emission wavelength and nonspecific organelle targeting hinder their therapeutic effectiveness. Herein, a donor&#8211;acceptor modulation approach is reported to construct a series of ionic AIE photosensitizers with enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) outcomes and fluorescent emission in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. By employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) and indolium (In) as the strong donor and acceptor, respectively, the compound DTP&#8208;In exhibits a substantial redshift in absorption and fluorescent emission reach to NIR&#8208;II region. The reduced energy gap between singlet and triplet states in DTP&#8208;In also increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rate. Further, DTP&#8208;In can self&#8208;assemble in aqueous solutions, forming positively charged nanoaggregates, which are superior to conventional encapsulated nanoparticles in cellular uptake and mitochondrial targeting. Consequently, DTP&#8208;In aggregates show efficient photodynamic ablation of 4T1 cancer cells and outstanding tumor theranostic in vivo under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation. This work highlights the potential of molecular engineering of donor&#8211;acceptor AIE PSs with multiple functionalities, thereby facilitating the development of more effective strategies for cancer therapy.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Matching Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface to Enhance Energy Storage of Polymer&#8208;Based Composite Dielectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To solve the interfacial mismatch between nanosheets and polymers in nanocomposite dielectrics, a &#8220;Metal&#8208;Ion Organic Hybrid Interface&#8221; (MOHI) between nanosheets and polymers is designed. The outstanding energy storage density &#8776;4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with high efficiency of &gt;90% is achieved at 150&#160;&#176;C, which is more than ten times that of polyimide (PI).








Abstract
In this work, a distinctive &#8220;metal&#8208;ion organic hybrid interface&#8221; (MOHI) between polyimide (PI) and calcium niobate (CNO) nanosheets is designed. The metal ions in the MOHI can achieve atomic&#8208;level matching not only with the inorganic CNO, but also with the PI chains, forming uniform and strong chemical bonds. These results are demonstrated by experiment and theory calculations. Significantly, the MOHI reduces the free volume and introduces deep traps across the filler&#8208;matrix interfacial area, thus suppressing the electric field distortion in PI&#8208;based composite dielectrics. Consequently, PI&#8208;based dielectric containing the MOHI exhibits excellent energy storage performance. The energy storage densities (Ue) of the composite dielectric reach 9.42 J cm&#8722;3 and 4.75 J cm&#8722;3 with energy storage efficiency (&#951;) of 90% at 25&#160;&#176;C and 150&#160;&#176;C respectively, which are 2.6 and 11.6 times higher than those of pure PI. This study provides new ideas for polymer&#8208;based composite dielectrics in high energy storage.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Tissue&#8208;Like Artificial Muscles with Low Temperature Activation and High Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial muscle combining crack&#8208;resistance (fracture energy of 33&#8239;720 J m&#8722;2 and fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&#8722;2), tissue&#8208;matched modulus (0.7&#160;MPa), low&#8208;temperature activation (40&#160;&#176;C), and high power density (450&#160;W kg&#8722;1) is created by introducing crystallizable segments and ethylene glycol flexible spacer into a liquid crystalline network, where the crystallization and covalent crosslinking density are finely controlled.








Abstract
Constructing soft robotics with safe human&#8211;machine interactions requires low&#8208;modulus, high&#8208;power&#8208;density artificial muscles that are sensitive to gentle stimuli. In addition, the ability to resist crack propagation during long&#8208;term actuation cycles is essential for a long service life. Herein, a material design is proposed to combine all these desirable attributes in a single artificial muscle platform.

     alt="Crack-Resistant and Tissue-Like Artificial Muscles with Low Temperature Activation and High Power Density"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An artificial muscle combining crack-resistance (fracture energy of 33&#8239;720 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), tissue-matched modulus (0.7&#160;MPa), low-temperature activation (40&#160;&#176;C), and high power density (450&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is created by introducing crystallizable segments and ethylene glycol flexible spacer into a liquid crystalline network, where the crystallization and covalent crosslinking density are finely controlled.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constructing soft robotics with safe human&#8211;machine interactions requires low-modulus, high-power-density artificial muscles that are sensitive to gentle stimuli. In addition, the ability to resist crack propagation during long-term actuation cycles is essential for a long service life. Herein, a material design is proposed to combine all these desirable attributes in a single artificial muscle platform. The design involves the molecular engineering of a liquid crystalline network with crystallizable segments and an ethylene glycol flexible spacer. A high degree of crystallinity can be afforded by utilizing aza-Michael chemistry to produce a low covalent crosslinking density, resulting in crack-insensitivity with a high fracture energy of 33&#160;720 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a high fatigue threshold of 2250 J m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Such crack-resistant artificial muscle with tissue-matched modulus of 0.7&#160;MPa can generate a high power density of 450&#160;W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a low temperature of 40&#160;&#176;C. Notably, because of the presence of crystalline domains in the actuated state, no crack propagation is observed after 500 heating&#8211;cooling actuation cycles under a static load of 220&#160;kPa.

         <title>Self&#8208;Encapsulation of High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoparticles inside Carbonized Wood for Highly Durable Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;driven surface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a highly active and long&#8208;lasting electrocatalyst composed of quinary high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEAs) (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) through thermal shock. The surface defects of ACW exhibit thermodynamically stable adsorption on the melting HEAs, rendering HEAs to aggregate and nucleate at the defect sites of ACW.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEAs) show great potential in emerging electrocatalysis due to their combination and optimization of multiple elements. However, synthesized HEAs often exhibit a weak interface with the conductive substrate, hindering their applications in long&#8208;term catalysis and energy conversion. Herein, a highly active and durable electrocatalyst composed of quinary HEAs (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) is reported. The self&#8208;encapsulation of HEAs is achieved during Joule heating synthesis (2060 K, 2 s) where HEAs naturally nucleate at the defect sites. In the meantime, HEAs catalyze the deposition of mobile carbon atoms to form a protective few&#8208;layer carbon shell during the rapid quenching process, thus remarkably strengthening the interface stability between HEAs and ACW. As a result, the HEAs@ACW shows not only favorable activity with an overpotential of 7&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for hydrogen evolution but also negligible attenuation during a 500 h stability test, which is superior to most reported electrocatalysts. The design of self&#8208;encapsulated HEAs inside ACW provides a critical strategy to enhance both activity and stability, which is also applicable to many other energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Less is More: Asymmetric D&#8211;A Type Agent to Achieve Dynamic Self&#8208;Assembled Nanoaggregates for Long&#8208;Acting Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates that can undergo &#8220;sphere&#8208;to&#8208;rod&#8221; process are constructed here by an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The nanoaggregates exhibit high tumor&#8208;targeting, prolonged retention, and favored metabolism by a single effort, finally contributing to long&#8208;acting photodynamic therapy treatment with low dose but high inhibition rate to tumors in vivo.








Abstract
To enhance the phototheranostic performance, agents with high reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, good tumor&#8208;targeting ability, and prolonged retention are urgently needed. However, symmetric donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) type agents usually produce spherical nanoaggregates, leading to good tumor targeting but inferior retention. Rod&#8208;like nanoaggregates are desired to extend their retention in tumors; however, this remains a challenge. In particular, agents with dynamically changeable shapes that integrate merits of different morphologies are seldomly reported. Therefore, self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates with smart shape tunability are designed here using an asymmetric D&#8211;A type TIBT. The photoluminescence quantum yield in solids is up to 52.24% for TIBT. TIBT also exhibits high ROS generation in corresponding nanoaggregates (TIBT&#8208;NCs). Moreover, dynamic self&#8208;assembly in shape changing from nanospheres to nanorods occurrs in TIBT&#8208;NCs, contributing to the enhancement of ROS quantum yield from 0.55 to 0.72. In addition, dynamic self&#8208;assembly can be observed for both in vitro and in vivo, conferring TIBT&#8208;NCs with strong tumor targeting and prolonged retention. Finally, efficient photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth is achieved in TIBT&#8208;NCs, with an inhibition rate of 90%. This work demonstrates that asymmetric D&#8211;A type agents can play significant roles in forming self&#8208;assembled organic nanoaggregates, thus showing great potential in long&#8208;acting cancer therapy.

         <title>Distinguishing Elements at the Sub&#8208;Nanometer Scale on the Surface of a High Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new methodology capable of distinguishing elements on the surface of a high entropy alloy at sub&#8208;nm scale is presented. This is achieved by combining scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and synchrotron radiation in the X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement. The elemental fingerprints are enabled with the XAS while the spatial resolution is achieved using the STM.








Abstract
Materials in crystalline form possess translational symmetry (TS) when the unit cell is repeated in real space with long&#8208; and short&#8208;range orders. The periodic potential in the crystal regulates the electron wave function and results in unique band structures, which further define the physical properties of the materials. Amorphous materials lack TS due to the randomization of distances and arrangements between atoms, causing the electron wave function to lack a well&#8208;defined momentum. High entropy materials provide another way to break the TS by randomizing the potential strength at periodic atomic sites. The local elemental distribution has a great impact on physical properties in high entropy materials. It is critical to distinguish elements at the sub&#8208;nanometer scale to uncover the correlations between the elemental distribution and the material properties. Here, the use of synchrotron X&#8208;ray scanning tunneling microscopy (SX&#8208;STM) with sub&#8208;nm scale resolution in identifying elements on a high entropy alloy (HEA) surface is demonstrated. By examining the elementally sensitive X&#8208;ray absorption spectra with an STM tip to enhance the spatial resolution, the elemental distribution on an HEA's surface at a sub&#8208;nm scale is extracted. These results open a pathway towards&#160;quantitatively&#160;understanding high entropy materials and their material properties.

         <title>All&#8208;Round Passivation Strategy Yield Flexible Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Solar Cells with Efficiency Exceeding 26.5%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceeding 26.5%&#8208;efficient all flexible Perovskite/CIGS Tandem solar cell is achieved by all&#8208;round passivation strategy termed Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces which improve film crystallinity and maximize the passivation of defects at various locations within the solar cell structure, effectively minimizing nonradiative recombination losses.








Abstract
The perovskite/Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) tandem solar cells (TSCs) presents a compelling technological combination poised for the next generation of flexible and lightweight photovoltaic (PV) tandem devices, featuring a tunable bandgap, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), lightweight flexibility, and enhanced stability and durability. Over the years, the imperative to enhance the performance of wide bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has grown significantly, particularly in the context of a flexible tandem device. In this study, an all&#8208;round passivation strategy known as Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces (DPGI) is introduced for WBG PSCs in perovskite/CIGS tandem structures. The implementation of DPGI is tailored to improve film crystallinity and passivate defects across the solar cell structure, leading to a substantial performance enhancement for WBG PSCs. Subsequently, both rigid and flexible tandem devices are assembled. Impressively, a fully flexible 4T perovskite/CIGS TSCs is successfully fabricated with a PCE of 26.57%, making it the highest value in this field and highlighting its potential applications in the next generation of flexible lightweight PV tandem devices.

In this study, an all-round passivation strategy known as Dual Passivation at Grains and Interfaces (DPGI) is introduced for WBG PSCs in perovskite/CIGS tandem structures. The implementation of DPGI is tailored to improve film crystallinity and passivate defects across the solar cell structure, leading to a substantial performance enhancement for WBG PSCs. Subsequently, both rigid and flexible tandem devices are assembled. Impressively, a fully flexible 4T perovskite/CIGS TSCs is successfully fabricated with a PCE of 26.57%, making it the highest value in this field and highlighting its potential applications in the next generation of flexible lightweight PV tandem devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Polymer Heteroatom Engineering Enables High Detectivity Symmetric Ambipolar Phototransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ambipolar organic semiconductors can offer balanced electron and hole transport, enabling light detection when implemented in thin film transistors. Here it is shown how a subtle change in a comonomer heteroatom results in a more electron&#8208;accepting polymer with preferential edge&#8208;on orientation. This results in higher electron mobility OTFTs with balanced charge transport that enable high&#8208;performing NIR ambipolar phototransistors and photo&#8208;inverters.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;performing ambipolar organic phototransistors (OPTs) can enable low&#8208;cost integrated circuits. Here, a heteroatom engineering approach to modify the electron affinity of a low band gap diketopyrrolopyrole (DPP) co&#8208;polymer, resulting in well&#8208;balanced charge transport, a more preferential edge&#8208;on orientation and higher crystallinity, is demonstrated. Changing the comonomer heteroatom from sulfur (benzothiadiazole (BT)) to oxygen (benzooxadiazole (BO)) leads to an increased electron affinity and introduces higher ambipolarity. Organic thin film transistors fabricated from the novel PDPP&#8208;BO exhibit charge carrier mobility of 0.6 and 0.3 cm2&#160;Vs&#8315;1 for electrons and holes, respectively. Due to the high sensitivity of the PDPP&#8208;based material and the balanced transport in PDPP&#8208;BO, its application as an NIR detector in an OPT architecture is presented. By maintaining a high on/off ratio (9 &#215; 104), ambipolar OPTs are shown with photoresponsivity of 69 and 99 A&#160;W&#8315;1 and specific detectivity of 8 &#215; 107 for the p&#8208;type operation and 4 &#215; 109 Jones for the n&#8208;type regime. The high symmetric NIR&#8208;ambipolar OPTs are also evaluated as ambipolar photo&#8208;inverters, and show a 46% gain enhancement under illumination.

         <title>Reprocessability in Engineering Thermosets Achieved Through Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) is shown to be an effective technique to manufacture high&#8208;performance poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thermosets with regenerative capabilities. The rapid curing of FROMP preserves the metathesis used to make the material, allowing effective reclamation of pDCPD performance across multiple generations. The strategy is simple and holds real promise to tackle end&#8208;of&#8208;life management challenges in industrial materials.








Abstract
While valued for their durability and exceptional performance, crosslinked thermosets are challenging to recycle and reuse. Here, inherent reprocessability in industrially relevant polyolefin thermosets is unveiled. Unlike prior methods, this approach eliminates the need to introduce exchangeable functionality to regenerate the material, relying instead on preserving the activity of the metathesis catalyst employed in the curing reaction. Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) proves critical to preserving this activity. Conditions controlling catalytic viability are explored to successfully reclaim performance across multiple generations of material, thus demonstrating long&#8208;term reprocessability. This straightforward and scalable remolding strategy is poised for widespread adoption. Given the anticipated growth in polyolefin thermosets, these findings represent an important conceptual advance in the pursuit of a fully circular lifecycle for thermoset polymers.

         <title>Optical&#8208;Cavity&#8208;Incorporated Colorful All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrochromic Devices for Dual Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design strategy that is structured around all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is developed to circumvent the critical problem in conventional all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device, which offers personalized devices that exhibit vivid structural colors and dual anti&#8208;counterfeiting, accompanied by fast switching responses and excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
The fusion of electrochromic technology with optical resonant cavities presents an intriguing innovation in the electrochromic field. However, this fusion is mainly achieved in liquid electrolyte&#8208;based or sol&#8211;gel electrolyte&#8208;based electrochromic devices, but not in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, which have broader industrial applications. Here, a new all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic device is demonstrated with a metal&#8211;dielectric&#8211;metal (MDM) resonant cavity, which can achieve strong thin&#8208;film interference effects through resonance, enabling the device to achieve unique structural colors that have rarely appeared in reported all&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrochromic devices, such as yellow green, purple, and light red. The color gamut of the device can be further expanded due to the adjustable optical constants of the electrochromic layer. What is more, this device exhibits remarkable cycling stability (maintaining 84% modulation capability after 7200 cycles), rapid switching time (coloration in 2.6 s and bleaching in 2.8 s), and excellent optical memory effect (only increasing by 13.8% after almost 36&#8239;000 s). In addition, this exquisite structural design has dual&#8208;responsive anti&#8208;counterfeiting effects based on voltage and angle, further demonstrating the powerful color modulation capability of this device.

         <title>Ferromagnetic Order in 2D Layers of Transition Metal Dichlorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ferromagnetic order at the single layer limit of two van der Waals materials based on transition metal dichlorides is probed. XMCD&#160;measurements demonstrate that the ferromagnetic order of FeCl2 and NiCl2 persist on top of a metallic substrate. LT&#8208;STS&#160;experiments, using functionalized tips with an organic magnetic sensor, confirm the magnetic order of the materials at the atomic scale even at zero applied magnetic fields.








Abstract
Magnetism in two dimensions is traditionally considered an exotic phase mediated by spin fluctuations, but far from collinearly ordered in the ground state. Recently, 2D magnetic states have been discovered in layered van der Waals compounds. Their robust and tunable magnetic state by material composition, combined with reduced dimensionality, foresee a strong potential as a key element in magnetic devices. Here, a class of 2D magnets based on metallic chlorides is presented. The magnetic order survives on top of a metallic substrate, even down to the monolayer limit, and can be switched from perpendicular to in&#8208;plane by substituting the metal ion from iron to nickel. Using functionalized STM tips as magnetic sensors, local exchange fields are identified, even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Since the compounds are processable by molecular beam epitaxy techniques, they provide a platform with large potential for incorporation into current device&#160;technologies.

         <title>Optimizing Ionomer Distribution in Anode Catalyst Layer for Stable Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The anode catalyst layer (ACL) is the key to determining the lifetime of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis. In this work, an efficient gradient ionomer distributed ACL structure is fabricated through optimizing the catalyst ink, which improves the durability by a factor of three compared to the normal ACL when operating at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
The high cost of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) originates from the usage of precious materials, insufficient efficiency, and lifetime. In this work, an important degradation mechanism of PEMWE caused by dynamics of ionomers over time in anode catalyst layer (ACL), which is a purely mechanical degradation of microstructure, is identified. Contrary to conventional understanding that the microstructure of ACL is static, the micropores are inclined to be occupied by ionomers due to the localized swelling/creep/migration, especially near the ACL/PTL (porous transport layer) interface, where they form transport channels of reactant/product couples. Consequently, the ACL with increased ionomers at PTL/ACL interface exhibit rapid and continuous degradation. In addition, a close correlation between the microstructure of ACL and the catalyst ink is discovered. Specifically, if more ionomers migrate to the top layer of the ink, more ionomers accumulate at the ACL/PEM interface, leaving fewer ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface. Therefore, the ionomer distribution in ACL is successfully optimized, which exhibits reduced ionomers at the ACL/PTL interface and enriches ionomers at the ACL/PEM interface, reducing the decay rate by a factor of three when operated at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 and 80&#160;&#176;C. The findings provide a general way to achieve low&#8208;cost hydrogen production.

         <title>Nonlinear Elastic Bottlebrush Polymer Hydrogels Modulate Actomyosin Mediated Protrusion Formation in Mesenchymal Stromal Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear elastic extracellular matrix properties are difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening and stress&#8208;relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymer hydrogels are used to isolate and tune the strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical feedback sensed by human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) in non&#8208;fibrous engineered microenvironments. Nonlinear elastic mechanics induces a protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC phenotype regulated by focal adhesions and actomyosin dynamics.








Abstract
The nonlinear elasticity of many tissue&#8208;specific extracellular matrices is difficult to recapitulate without the use of fibrous architectures, which couple strain&#8208;stiffening with stress relaxation. Herein, bottlebrush polymers are synthesized and crosslinked to form poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based hydrogels and used to study how strain&#8208;stiffening behavior affects human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). By tailoring the bottlebrush polymer length, the critical stress associated with the onset of network stiffening is systematically varied, and a unique protrusion&#8208;rich hMSC morphology emerges only at critical stresses within a biologically accessible stress regime. Local cell&#8208;matrix interactions are quantified using 3D traction force microscopy and small molecule inhibitors are used to identify cellular machinery that plays a critical role in hMSC mechanosensing of the engineered, strain&#8208;stiffening microenvironment. Collectively, this study demonstrates how covalently crosslinked bottlebrush polymer hydrogels can recapitulate strain&#8208;stiffening biomechanical cues at biologically relevant stresses and be used to probe how nonlinear elastic matrix properties regulate cellular processes.

         <title>High Performance As&#8208;Cast Organic Solar Cells Enabled by a Refined Double&#8208;Fibril Network Morphology and Improved Dielectric Constant of Active Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
As&#8208;cast organic solar cell with a record&#8208;high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is constructed via introducing a novel polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;TPT) into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a favorable double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Consequently, the as&#8208;cast device affords a champion PCE of 18.60% and excellent device stability, which bring new insights into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast device.








Abstract
High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are usually realized by using post&#8208;treatment and/or additive, which can induce the formation of metastable morphology, leading to unfavorable device stability. In terms of the industrial production, the development of high efficiency as&#8208;cast OSCs is crucially important, but it remains a great challenge to obtain appropriate active layer morphology and high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Here, efficient as&#8208;cast OSCs are constructed via introducing a new polymer acceptor PY&#8208;TPT with a high dielectric constant into the D18:L8&#8208;BO blend to form a double&#8208;fibril network morphology. Besides, the incorporation of PY&#8208;TPT enables an enhanced dielectric constant and lower exciton binding energy of active layer. Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport are realized in D18:L8&#8208;BO:PY&#8208;TPT&#8208;based device, affording a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.60% and excellent photostability in absence of post&#8208;treatment. Moreover, green solvent&#8208;processed devices, thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) devices, and module (16.60 cm2) are fabricated, which show PCEs of 17.45%, 17.54%, and 13.84%, respectively. This work brings new insight into the construction of efficient as&#8208;cast devices, pushing forward the practical application of OSCs.

         <title>The Role of Solution Aggregation Property toward High&#8208;Efficiency Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Photovoltaic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A systematic study of the representative organic photovoltaic systems shows that the aggregation competition between polymer donor (PD) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) is a decisive factor in the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. Based on 64 PD/NFA combinations, the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter heatmaps are plotted, providing a new matching rule for developing high&#8208;efficiency PD/NFA systems.








Abstract
In organic photovoltaic cells, the solution&#8208;aggregation effect (SAE) is long considered a critical factor in achieving high power&#8208;conversion efficiencies for polymer donor (PD)/non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) blend systems. However, the underlying mechanism has yet to be fully understood. Herein, based on an extensive study of blends consisting of the representative 2D&#8208;benzodithiophene&#8208;based PDs and acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;type NFAs, it is demonstrated that SAE shows a strong correlation with the aggregation kinetics during solidification, and the aggregation competition between PD and NFA determines the phase separation of blend film and thus the photovoltaic performance. PDs with strong SAEs enable earlier aggregation evolutions than NFAs, resulting in well&#8208;known polymer&#8208;templated fibrillar network structures and superior PCEs. With the weakening of PDs&#8217; aggregation effects, NFAs, showing stronger tendencies to aggregate, tend to form oversized domains, leading to significantly reduced external quantum efficiencies and fill factors. These trends reveal the importance of matching SAE between PD and NFA. The aggregation abilities of various materials are further evaluated and the aggregation ability/photovoltaic parameter diagrams of 64 PD/NFA combinations are provided. This work proposes a guiding criteria and facile approach to match efficient PD/NFA systems.

         <title>Scalable Approach to Molecular Motor&#8208;Polymer Conjugates for Light&#8208;Driven Artificial Muscles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled polymerization allows scalable access to light&#8208;driven artificial muscles based on molecular motors. A combined experimental and computer simulation framework provides deep insights into how chain conformational aspects and density of active motors influence contraction kinetics and load&#8208;lifting capacity.








Abstract
The integration of molecular machines and motors into materials represents a promising avenue for creating dynamic and functional molecular systems, with potential applications in soft robotics or reconfigurable biomaterials. However, the development of truly scalable and controllable approaches for incorporating molecular motors into polymeric matrices has remained a challenge. Here, it is shown that light&#8208;driven molecular motors with sensitive photo&#8208;isomerizable double bonds can be converted into initiators for Cu&#8208;mediated controlled/living radical polymerization enabling the synthesis of star&#8208;shaped motor&#8208;polymer conjugates. This approach enables scalability, precise control over the molecular structure, block copolymer structures, and high&#8208;end group fidelity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these materials can be crosslinked to form gels with quasi&#8208;ideal network topology, exhibiting light&#8208;triggered contraction. The influence of arm length and polymer structure is investigated, and the first molecular dynamics simulation framework to gain deeper insights into the contraction processes is developed. Leveraging this scalable methodology, the creation of bilayer soft robotic devices and cargo&#8208;lifting artificial muscles is showcased, highlighting the versatility and potential applications of this advanced polymer chemistry approach.

     alt="Scalable Approach to Molecular Motor-Polymer Conjugates for Light-Driven Artificial Muscles"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlled polymerization allows scalable access to light-driven artificial muscles based on molecular motors. A combined experimental and computer simulation framework provides deep insights into how chain conformational aspects and density of active motors influence contraction kinetics and load-lifting capacity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The integration of molecular machines and motors into materials represents a promising avenue for creating dynamic and functional molecular systems, with potential applications in soft robotics or reconfigurable biomaterials. However, the development of truly scalable and controllable approaches for incorporating molecular motors into polymeric matrices has remained a challenge. Here, it is shown that light-driven molecular motors with sensitive photo-isomerizable double bonds can be converted into initiators for Cu-mediated controlled/living radical polymerization enabling the synthesis of star-shaped motor-polymer conjugates. This approach enables scalability, precise control over the molecular structure, block copolymer structures, and high-end group fidelity. Moreover, it is demonstrated that these materials can be crosslinked to form gels with quasi-ideal network topology, exhibiting light-triggered contraction. The influence of arm length and polymer structure is investigated, and the first molecular dynamics simulation framework to gain deeper insights into the contraction processes is developed. Leveraging this scalable methodology, the creation of bilayer soft robotic devices and cargo-lifting artificial muscles is showcased, highlighting the versatility and potential applications of this advanced polymer chemistry approach. It is anticipated that the integrated experimental and simulation framework will accelerate scalable approaches for active polymer materials based on molecular machines, opening up new horizons in materials science and bioscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrically Conductive Collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS Hydrogel Prevents Post&#8208;Infarct Cardiac Arrhythmia and Supports hiPSC&#8208;Cardiomyocyte Function</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrically conductive hydrogel is developed to prevent arrhythmia after myocardial infarction (MI), allowing human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocyte function and maturation. Incorporation of poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) in collagen results in a hydrogel with different microstructure, enhanced gelation kinetics, and increased conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes exhibit in this hydrogel mature sarcomeric structures and enhanced calcium handling. Transplanting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels is sufficient to protect the infarcted heart against ventricular tachycardia.








Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) causes cell death, disrupts electrical activity, triggers arrhythmia, and results in heart failure, whereby 50&#8211;60% of MI&#8208;associated deaths manifest as sudden cardiac deaths (SCD). The most effective therapy for SCD prevention is implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). However, ICDs contribute to adverse remodeling and disease progression and do not prevent arrhythmia. This work develops an injectable collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate) hydrogel that protects infarcted hearts against ventricular tachycardia (VT) and can be combined with human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;cardiomyocytes to promote partial cardiac remuscularization. PEDOT:PSS improves collagen gel formation, micromorphology, and conductivity. hiPSC&#8208;cardiomyocytes in collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels exhibit near&#8208;adult sarcomeric length, improved contractility, enhanced calcium handling, and conduction velocity. RNA&#8208;sequencing data indicate enhanced maturation and improved cell&#8208;matrix interactions. Injecting collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels in infarcted mouse hearts decreases VT to the levels of healthy hearts. Collectively, collagen&#8208;PEDOT:PSS hydrogels offer a versatile platform for treating cardiac injuries.

         <title>Capillarity&#8208;Driven Enrichment and Hydrodynamic Trapping of Trace Nucleic Acids by Plasmonic Cavity Membrane for Rapid and Sensitive Detections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a plasmonic cavity membrane that is designed to not only enrich and capture trace nucleic acids in a clinically relevant large sample volume by taking advantage of capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also achieve rapid amplification and sensitive detection is reported.








Abstract
Small&#8208;reactor&#8208;based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has attracted considerable attention. A significant number of tiny reactors must be prepared in parallel to capture, amplify, and accurately quantify few target genes in clinically relevant large volume, which, however, requires sophisticated microfabrication and longer sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer time. Here, single plasmonic cavity membrane is reported that not only enriches and captures few nucleic acids by taking advantage of both capillarity and hydrodynamic trapping but also quickly amplifies them for sensitive plasmonic detection. The plasmonic cavity membrane with few nanoliters in a void volume is fabricated by self&#8208;assembling gold nanorods with SiO2 tips. Simulations reveal that hydrodynamic stagnation between the SiO2 tips is mainly responsible for the trapping of the nucleic acid in the membrane. Finally, it is shown that the plasmonic cavity membrane is capable of enriching&#160;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) genes up to 20&#160;000&#8208;fold within 1&#160;min, amplifying within 3&#160;min, and detecting the trace genes as low as a single copy &#181;L&#8722;1. It is anticipated that this work not only expands the utility of PCR but also provides an innovative way of the enrichment and detection of trace biomolecules in a variety of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing applications.

         <title>Primary Human Breast Cancer&#8208;Associated Endothelial Cells Favor Interactions with Nanomedicines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor blood vessels are barriers for nanomedicines en route to solid tumors. This study indicates that primary human breast tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit higher nanoparticle uptake efficiency than normal mammary microvascular endothelial cells, along with an increased number of intracellular vesicles and upregulated transport&#8208;related genes. These findings may advance the development of safer and more effective cancer nanomedicines.








Abstract
Cancer nanomedicines predominately rely on transport processes controlled by tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells to deliver therapeutic and diagnostic payloads into solid tumors. While the dominant role of this class of endothelial cells for nanoparticle transport and tumor delivery is established in animal models, the translational potential in human cells needs exploration. Using primary human breast cancer as a model, the differential interactions of normal and tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells with clinically relevant nanomedicine formulations are explored and quantified. Primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit up to &#8776;2&#160;times higher nanoparticle uptake than normal human mammary microvascular endothelial cells. Super&#8208;resolution imaging studies reveal a significantly higher intracellular vesicle number for tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells, indicating a substantial increase in cellular transport activities. RNA sequencing and gene expression analysis indicate the upregulation of transport&#8208;related genes, especially motor protein genes, in tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cells. Collectively, the results demonstrate that primary human breast cancer&#8208;associated endothelial cells exhibit enhanced interactions with nanomedicines, suggesting a potentially significant role for these cells&#160;in nanoparticle tumor delivery in human patients. Engineering nanoparticles that leverage the translational potential of tumor&#8208;associated endothelial cell&#8208;mediated transport into human solid tumors may lead to the development of safer and more effective clinical cancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Smart Nanoassembly Enabling Activatable NIR Fluorescence and ROS Generation with Enhanced Tumor Penetration for Imaging&#8208;Guided Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
LipoHPM, a smart tumor&#8208;targeting nanoplatform, integrates activatable fluorescence imaging and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation within tumor cells. Both fluorescence and ROS exhibit an OFF&#8208;state in blood circulation, minimizing background interference and phototoxic side effects. Upon tumor internalization, LipoHPM switches to an ON&#8208;state, releasing hydralazine for enhanced tumor penetration, activating fluorescence for high&#8208;contrast tumor imaging, and boosting ROS generation for potent photodynamic therapy efficacy.








Abstract
Fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided photodynamic therapy (FIG&#8208;PDT) holds promise for cancer treatment, yet challenges persist in poor imaging quality, phototoxicity, and insufficient anti&#8208;tumor effect. Herein, a novel nanoplatform, LipoHPM, designed to address these challenges, is reported. This approach employs an acid&#8208;sensitive amine linker to connect a biotin&#8208;modified hydrophilic polymer (BiotinPEG) with a new hydrophobic photosensitizer (MBA), forming OFF&#8208;state BiotinPEG&#8208;MBA (PM) micelles via an aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect. These micelles are then co&#8208;loaded with the tumor penetration enhancer hydralazine (HDZ) into pH&#8208;sensitive liposomes (LipoHPM). Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin&#8208;receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type&#8208;I and type&#8208;II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near&#8208;infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti&#8208;tumor and anti&#8208;metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG&#8208;PDT applications.

Leveraging the ACQ effect, LipoHPM is silent in both fluorescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation during blood circulation but restores both properties upon disassembly. Following intravenous injection in tumor-bearing mice, LipoHPM actively targets tumor cells overexpressing biotin-receptors, contributing to enhanced tumor accumulation. Upon cellular internalization, LipoHPM disassembles within lysosomes, releasing HDZ to enhance tumor penetration and inhibit tumor metastasis. Concurrently, the micelles activate fluorescence for tumor imaging and boost the production of both type-I and type-II ROS for tumor eradication. Therefore, the smart LipoHPM synergistically integrates near-infrared emission, activatable tumor imaging, robust ROS generation, efficient anti-tumor and anti-metastasis activity, successfully overcoming limitations of conventional photosensitizers and establishing itself as a promising nanoplatform for potent FIG-PDT applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Function Electrolyte Additive Design for Long Life Alkaline Zinc Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article demonstrates a dual&#8208;function additive strategy aimed at addressing the capacity loss in alkaline aqueous zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) during long&#8208;duration operations in real&#8208;world applications. This dual&#8208;function additive promotes uniform zinc deposition, slows down corrosion in alkaline environments, and inhibits the formation of dead zinc, thereby enhancing the capacity retention of AZFBs and significantly extending their battery cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries (AZFBs) have emerged as a promising electrochemical energy storage technology owing to Zn abundance, high safety, and low cost. However, zinc dendrite growth and the formation of dead zinc greatly impede the development of AZFBs. Herein, a dual&#8208;function electrolyte additive strategy is proposed to regulate zinc nucleation and mitigate the hydroxide corrosion of zinc depositions for stable AZFBs. This strategy, as exemplified by urea, introduces an electrolyte additive to coordinate with Zn2+/Zn with proper strength, slowing zinc deposition kinetics to induce uniform nucleation and protecting the deposited zinc surface from attack by hydroxide ions through preferable adsorption. The zincate complexes with urea are identified to be Zn(OH)2(urea)(H2O)2 and Zn2(OH)4(H2O)4(urea), which exhibit slow zinc deposition kinetics, allowing instantaneous nucleation. Calculation results reveal an additional energy barrier of 1.29&#160;eV for the subsequent adsorption of an OH&#8722; group when a urea molecule absorbs on the zinc cluster, significantly mitigating the formation of dead zinc. Consequently, prolonged cell cycling of the prototype alkaline zinc&#8208;iron flow battery demonstrates stable operation for over 130 h and an average coulombic efficiency of 98.5%. It is anticipated that this electrolyte additive strategy will pave the way for developing highly stable AZFBs.

         <title>Understanding and Weakening Photon Recycling in Solar Cells to Approach the Radiative Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new photon recycling model is proposed by considering the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding open&#8208;circuit voltage losses of solar cells. This model reveals that weakening photon recycling is more effective to approach the radiative limit of solar cells than enhancing it, and helps to achieve higher device stability.








Abstract
Photon recycling plays an important role in the light outcoupling of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells and is considered a necessary condition to achieve the radiative limit of open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and efficiency. However, due to the impact of photon recycling on bulk and surface radiation of solar cells being overlooked, experimental demonstrations on the accuracy of existing photon recycling models are scarce and some contrary theoretical results also emerge. Here, the relationship between photon recycling and radiation processes, as well as the corresponding VOC losses of solar cells based on the principle of detailed balance is clarified. It is shown that weakening photon recycling is more effective to boost the device performance than enhancing it, promoting the theoretical efficiencies of solar cells, such as perovskite, Si, and GaAs, to 98.5%, 94.9%, and almost 100% of their radiative limit, respectively. Moreover, weakening photon recycling also helps to maintain higher efficiency when the internal radiative efficiency decreases, which benefits higher device stability. This work provides an in&#8208;depth understanding of the role of photon recycling in solar cells and helps to push efficiency to a new limit.

         <title>Defect Engineering for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reaction on Transition Metal Oxides: The Role of Metal Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study provides a strategy for regulating metal defects, including theoretical predictions and experimental validation. The activation of octahedral sites facilitates the adsorption of reactants, deprotonation of OH*, and the desorption of reaction products, ultimately leading to the achievement of a highly efficient dual&#8208;function catalyst for ORR and OER.








Abstract
Metal defect engineering is a highly effective strategy for addressing the prevalent high overpotential issues associated with transition metal oxides functioning as dual&#8208;function commercial oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction catalysts for increasing their activity and stability. However, the high formation energy of metal defects poses a challenge to the development of strategies to precisely control the selectivity during metal defect formation. Here, density functional theory calculations are used to demonstrate that altering the pathway of metal defect formation releases metal atoms as metal chlorides, which effectively reduces the formation energy of defects. The metal defects on the monometallic metal oxide surface (Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) are selectively produced using chlorine plasma. The characterization and density functional theory calculations reveal that catalytic activity is enhanced owing to electronic delocalization induced by metal defects, which reduces the theoretical overpotential. Notably, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, ex situ XPS, and in situ ATR&#8208;SEIRAS suggest that metal defects effectively improve the adsorption of reactive species on active sites and enhance the efficiency of product desorption, thereby boosting catalytic performance.

The metal halide octahedron is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of perovskites. However, the impact of octahedral connectivity in perovskites on device performance is not systematically explored. This manuscript provides direct experimental evidence that the existence of non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing regions is detrimental to device performance and provides key guidance on how to regulate octahedral connectivity.








Abstract
The metal halide (BX6)4&#8208; octahedron, where B represents a metal cation and X represents a halide anion, is regarded as the fundamental structural and functional unit of metal halide perovskites. However, the influence of the way the (BX6)4&#8722; octahedra connect to each other has on the structural stability and optoelectronic properties of metal halide perovskite is still unclear. Here, the octahedral connectivity, including corner&#8208;, edge&#8208;, and face&#8208;sharing, of various CsxFA1&#8208;xPbI3 (0&#160;&#8804;&#160;x&#160;&#8804;&#160;0.3) perovskite films is tuned and reliably characterized through compositional and additive engineering, and with ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy. It is found that the overall solar cell device performance, the charge carrier lifetime, the open&#8208;circuit voltage, and the current density&#8211;voltage hysteresis are all improved when the films consist of corner&#8208;sharing octahedra, and non&#8208;corner sharing phases are suppressed, even in films with the same chemical composition. Additionally, it is found that the structural, optoelectronic, and device performance stabilities are similarly enhanced when non&#8208;corner&#8208;sharing connectivities are suppressed. This approach, combining macroscopic device tests and microscopic material characterization, provides a powerful tool enabling a thorough understanding of the impact of octahedral connectivity on device performance, and opens a new parameter space for designing high&#8208;performance photovoltaic metal halide perovskite devices.

         <title>Nonflammable Succinonitrile&#8208;Based Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Intrinsically Safe High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion battery is realized by the new&#8208;type of nonflammable succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte. The deep eutectic electrolyte with a strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN effectively improves the compatibility of SN with Lewis bases.








Abstract
Intrinsically safe sodium&#8208;ion batteries are considered as a promising candidate for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems. However, the high flammability of conventional electrolytes may pose serious safety threats and even explosions. Herein, a strategy of constructing a deep eutectic electrolyte is proposed to boost the safety and electrochemical performance of succinonitrile (SN)&#8208;based electrolyte. The strong hydrogen bond between S&#9552;O of 1,3,2&#8208;dioxathiolane&#8208;2,2&#8208;dioxide (DTD) and the &#945;&#8208;H of SN endows the enhanced safety and compatibility of SN with Lewis bases. Meanwhile, the DTD participates in the inner Na+ sheath and weakens the coordination number of SN. The unique solvation configuration promotes the formation of robust gradient inorganic&#8208;rich electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase, and merits stable cycling of half&#8208;cells in a wide temperature range, with a capacity retention of 82.8% after 800 cycles (25&#160;&#176;C) and 86.3% after 100 cycles (60&#160;&#176;C). Correspondingly, the full cells deliver tremendous improvement in cycling stability and rate performance.

         <title>Nonpersistent Nanoarchitectures Enhance Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy in an Immunocompetent Orthotopic Model of HPV+ Head/Neck Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonpersistent nanoarchitectures comprising cluster&#8208;size gold demonstrate, in combination with radiotherapy, an outperforming therapeutic efficacy on orthotopic human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck squamous cell carcinoma immunocompetent murine models. This approach overcomes the clinical limitations associated to metal&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;mediated radiotherapy while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to the gold standard, opening new horizons in oral cancer management.









Abstract
Cisplatin chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the established standard of care for managing locally advanced human papillomavirus&#8208;positive head/neck carcinoma. The typically young patients may suffer serious and long&#8208;time side effects caused by the treatment, such as dysphagia, and hearing loss. Thus, ensuring a satisfactory post&#8208;treatment quality of life is paramount. One potential replacing approach to the classical CRT involves the combination of standard&#8208;dose radiotherapy and radiosensitizers such as noble metal nanoparticles (NPs). However, several concerns about size, shape, and biocompatibility limit the translation of metal nanomaterials to the clinical practice. Here, it is demonstrated that a new model of nonpersistent gold nanoarchitectures containing cisplatin (NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt) generates, in combination with radiotherapy, a significant in vivo tumor&#8208;reducing effect compared to the standard CRT, achieving a complete tumor clearance in 25% of the immunocompetent models that persist for 60 days. These findings, together with the negligible amount of metals recognized in the excretory organs, highlight that the concurrent administration of NAs&#8208;Cluster&#8208;CisPt and radiotherapy has the potential to overcome some clinical limitations associated to NP&#8208;based approaches while enhancing the treatment outcome with respect to standard CRT. Overall, despite further mechanistic investigations being essential, these data support the exploiting of nonpersistent metal&#8208;nanomaterial&#8208;mediated approaches for oral cancer management.

         <title>5.1&#160;&#181;m Ion&#8208;Regulated Rigid Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte Constructed by Bridging Fast Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Channels for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

A 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte layer&#160;constructed by tough Kevlar nanofibers bridge with metal&#8208;organic framework channels&#160;and in&#8208;situ polymerized deep&#8208;eutectic&#8208;solvent as the ion&#8208;transport carrier is designed on the cathode. This quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte with nano&#8208;network&#8208;topology&#160;has considerable Li+ transport properties, low ionic diffusion activation energy, and high modulus, which guarantees the high cyclic stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
An ultra&#8208;thin quasi&#8208;solid electrolyte (QSE) with dendrite&#8208;inhibiting properties is a requirement for achieving high energy density quasi&#8208;solid lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Here, a 5.1&#160;&#181;m rigid QSE layer is directly designed on the cathode, in which Kevlar (poly(p&#8208;phenylene terephthalate)) nanofibers (KANFs) with negatively charged groups bridging metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) particles are served as a rigid skeleton, and non&#8208;flammable deep eutectic solvent is selected to be encapsulated into the MOF channels, combined with in situ polymerization to complete safe electrolyte system with high rigidness and stability. The QSE with&#160;constructed topological network demonstrates high rigidity (5.4&#160;GPa), high ionic conductivity (0.73 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature), good ion&#8208;regulated properties, and improved structural stability, contributing to homogenized Li&#8208;ion flux, excellent dendrite suppression, and prolonged cyclic performance for LMB. Additionally, ion regulation influences the Li deposition behavior, exhibiting a uniform morphology on the Li&#8208;metal surface after cycling. According to density&#8208;functional theory, KANFs bridging MOFs as hosts play a vital function in the free&#8208;state and fast diffusion dynamics of Li&#8208;ions. This work provides an effective strategy for constructing ultrathin robust electrolytes with a novel ionic conduction mode.

Tissue Engineering
In article number 2308949 by Maik Schot, Jeroen Leijten, and co&#8208;workers, engineered living tissues containing high density capillary networks are fabricated in a clinically scalable manner. This is achieved by photo&#8208;annealing living microtissues, which are mass produced using in&#8208;air microfluidics. The resulting microporous yet monolithic living tissues are directly perfusable and offer micrometer&#8208;scale diffusive length regardless of tissue size, enabling unprecedented exchange rates for nutrients, waste products, and stimulating molecules to allow for the upscaling of living matter.

Revealing Element Distributions on High Entropy Alloy Surface
By combining elemental sensitive synchrotron X&#8208;ray techniques with high spatial resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, the authors are able to extract the element distributions at the sub&#8208;nm scale on the surfaces of high entropy alloys. In article number 2402442, Lauren Kim, TeYu Chien, and co&#8208;workers utilize X&#8208;ray assisted tunneling to enhance the elemental sensitivity with high spatial resolution to achieve this goal. This technique paves the path for correlating element local arrangements to the physical properties of the high entropy materials.

Blocking Sound with Silk
In article number 2313328 by Yoel Fink and co&#8208;workers, sound control using traditional fabrics is explored. A silk fabric with a piezoelectric fiber emits 70 dB of sound. Surprisingly, by dynamically suppressing vibrations in a 130&#8208;micron silk monolayer, transmitted sound decreases by 75% and acoustic reflectivity increases by 68%. These findings present opportunities in apparel, transportation, and architecture.

Highly Durable Electrocatalysis
In article number 2402391, Yonggang Yao, Wentao Gan, and co&#8208;workers report a highly active and long&#8208;lasting electrocatalyst composed of quinary HEAs (PtNiCoFeCu) encapsulated inside the activated carbonized wood (ACW) through Joule heating and rapid quenching treatment. The surface defects of ACW exhibit thermodynamically stable adsorption on the melting HEAs, which induces HEAs to aggregate and nucleate at the defect sites of ACW. This self&#8208;encapsulation design provides a critical strategy to enhance both electrocatalytic activity and stability, which is also applicable to many other energy conversion technologies.

Virus&#8208;Sized Protein Structures Filled with Gas
The large size of conventional contrast agents limits the tissues and targets ultrasound can image. In articles 2307123 and 2307106, George Lu, Mikhail Shapiro and their co&#8208;workers genetically designed two different types of tiny gas&#8208;filled protein nanostructures. These structures represent some of the smallest stable, free&#8208;floating bubbles ever made and demonstrate enhanced abilities to infiltrate tumors and lymph nodes, highlighting their potential for ultrasound imaging and delivery.

Post&#8208;Transition Metal Chalcogenides
In article number 2400800, Sungkyu Kim, Feng Ding, Joonki Suh, and co&#8208;workers introduce so&#8208;called phase&#8208;centric approach for producing post&#8208;transition metal chalcogenides using low&#8208;temperature metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). High&#8208;crystalline 2D SnSe2 films can be directly prepared in wafer scale with excellent uniformity. With theoretical inputs, the authors indirectly produce SnSe film with all benefits of MOCVD. This set of techniques will provide a new route to the BEOL&#8208;compatible preparation of high&#8208;quality post&#8208;transition metal chalcogenides.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The action motion and biosignals of the musculoskeletal system from in vitro to in vivo play critical role in both medical diagnosis and personal healthcare. In this review, the musculoskeletal electronics is proposed, and the history is briefly outlined, strategies and development trend of related materials and devices are progressed and designed.








Abstract
The musculoskeletal system, constituting the largest human physiological system, plays a critical role in providing structural support to the body, facilitating intricate movements, and safeguarding internal organs. By virtue of advancements in revolutionized materials and devices, particularly in the realms of motion capture, health monitoring, and postoperative rehabilitation, &#8220;musculoskeletal electronics&#8221; has actually emerged as an infancy area, but has not yet been explicitly proposed. In this review, the concept of musculoskeletal electronics is elucidated, and the evolution history, representative progress, and key strategies of the involved materials and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art devices are summarized. Therefore, the fundamentals of musculoskeletal electronics and key functionality categories are introduced. Subsequently, recent advances in musculoskeletal electronics are presented from the perspectives of &#8220;in vitro&#8221; to &#8220;in vivo&#8221; signal detection, interactive modulation, and therapeutic interventions for healing and recovery. Additionally, nine strategy avenues for the development of advanced musculoskeletal electronic materials and devices are proposed. Finally, concise summaries and perspectives are proposed to highlight the directions that deserve focused attention in this booming field.

         <title>Ultrasmall Inorganic Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Preparation, Functionalization, and Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm) are a unique type of porous nanomaterial with numerous advantages, involving abundant mesopores, low density, high specific surface area, multiple reaction sites, and small size effect, which have been widely used in multiple applications, such as catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery.








Abstract
Ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles (&lt;50&#160;nm), a unique porous nanomaterial, have been widely studied in many fields in the last decade owing to the abundant advantages, involving rich mesopores, low density, high surface area, numerous reaction sites, large cavity space, ultrasmall size, etc. This paper presents a review of recent advances in the preparation, functionalization, and applications of ultrasmall inorganic mesoporous nanoparticles for the first time. The soft monomicelles&#8208;directed method, in contrast to the hard&#8208;template and template&#8208;free methods, is more flexible in the synthesis of mesoporous nanoparticles. This is because the amphiphilic micelle has tunable functional blocks, controlled molecule masses, configurations and mesostructures. Focus on the soft micelle directing method, monomicelles could be classified into four types, i.e., the Pluronic&#8208;type block copolymer monomicelles, laboratory&#8208;synthesized amphiphilic block copolymers monomicelles, the single&#8208;molecule star&#8208;shaped block copolymer monomicelles, and the small&#8208;molecule anionic/cationic surfactant monomicelles. This paper also reviews the functionalization of the inner mesopores and the outer surfaces, which includes constructing the yolkshell structures (encapsulated nanoparticles), anchoring the active components packed on the shell and building an asymmetric Janus architecture. Then, several representative applications, involving catalysis, energy storage, and biomedicines are presented. Finally, the prospects and challenges of controlled synthesis and large&#8208;scale applications of ultrasmall mesoporous nanoparticles in the future are foreseen.

         <title>Hydroxide&#8208;Derived Nanostructures: Scalable Synthesis, Characterization, Properties, and Potential Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study summarizes the recent discovery on how to convert, in one pot, non&#8208;toxic earth&#8208;abundant precursors into nanostructures at the kilogram scale at temperatures &lt;100&#160;&#176;C and under ambient pressures. MnO2, 2D birnessite flakes, Fe3O4 nanoparticles, and titanate 1D nanofilaments are synthesized; the latter is a new form of TiO2 that exhibits quantum confinement and has a host of applications.








Abstract
Metal oxide nanostructures have received an increasing attention owing to their unique chemical and physical properties along with their widespread applications in various fields. This article provides an overview of the recent discovery &#8211; christened Hydroxides&#8208;Derived Nanostructures, or HDNs &#8211; in which hydroxide aqueous solutions (mostly tetramethylammonium hydroxide, TMAH) are reacted at temperatures &lt; 100&#160;&#176;C and under atmospheric pressure with various metal&#8208;containing precursors to scalably prepare novel metal oxide nanostructures. In one case, a dozen commercial and earth abundant Ti&#8208;containing powders such as binary carbides, nitrides, borides, among others, are converted into new, 1D TiO2&#8208;based lepidocrocite (1DL) nanofilaments (NFs). Application&#8208;wise, the 1DLs show outstanding performance in a number of energy, environmental, and biomedical fields such as photo&#8208; and electrocatalysis, water splitting, lithium&#8211;sulfur and lithium&#8208;ion batteries, water purification, dye degradation, cancer therapy, and polymer composites. In addition to 1DL, the HDNs family encompasses other metal oxides nanostructures including magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MnO2 birnessite&#8208;based crystalline 2D flakes. The latter showed promise in electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. The developed recipe provides a new vista in the molecular self&#8208;assembly synthesis of nanomaterials that can advance the field with a library of novel nanostructures with substantial implications in a multitude of fields.

In addition to 1DL, the HDNs family encompasses other metal oxides nanostructures including magnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticles and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; birnessite-based crystalline 2D flakes. The latter showed promise in electrochemical energy conversion and storage applications. The developed recipe provides a new vista in the molecular self-assembly synthesis of nanomaterials that can advance the field with a library of novel nanostructures with substantial implications in a multitude of fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Critical Analysis of Membranes toward Sustainable and Efficient Vanadium Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are considered to be promising for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy with safety, flexibility, and durability. This review analyzes how key parameters of membranes that are critical components in VRFBs influence the device performance. Insights into design strategies for membranes for efficient VRFB are provided.








Abstract
Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB) are a promising technology for large&#8208;scale storage of electrical energy, combining safety, high capacity, ease of scalability, and prolonged durability; features which have triggered their early commercial implementation. Furthering the deployment of VRFB technologies requires addressing challenges associated to a pivotal component: the membrane. Examples include vanadium crossover, insufficient conductivity, escalated costs, and sustainability concerns related to the widespread adoption of perfluoroalkyl&#8208;based membranes, e.g., perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA). Herein, recent advances in high&#8208;performance and sustainable membranes for VRFB, offering insights into prospective research directions to overcome these challenges, are reviewed. The analysis reveals the disparities and trade&#8208;offs between performance advances enabled by PFSA membranes and composites, and the lack of sustainability in their final applications. The potential of PFSA&#8208;free membranes and present strategies to enhance their performance are discussed. This study delves into vital membrane parameters to enhance battery performance, suggesting protocols and design strategies to achieve high&#8208;performance and sustainable VRFB membranes.

         <title>Challenges and Breakthroughs in Enhancing Temperature Tolerance of Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) demonstrate distinct advantages over lithium&#8208;ion batteries across various applications when considering a wide temperature range. Herein, this review delves into the research on wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, offering a comprehensive analysis of how temperature affects the parameters governing battery performance. Furthermore, it summarizes the modification strategies for electrodes and electrolytes aimed at enhancing battery performance under extreme temperature conditions.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;based batteries (LBBs) have been highly researched and recognized as a mature electrochemical energy storage (EES) system in recent years. However, their stability and effectiveness are primarily confined to room temperature conditions. At temperatures significantly below 0&#160;&#176;C or above 60&#160;&#176;C, LBBs experience substantial performance degradation. Under such challenging extreme contexts, sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) emerge as a promising complementary technology, distinguished by their fast dynamics at low&#8208;temperature regions and superior safety under elevated temperatures. Notably, developing SIBs suitable for wide&#8208;temperature usage still presents significant challenges, particularly for specific applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and deep&#8208;space/polar explorations, which requires a thorough understanding of how SIBs perform under different temperature conditions. By reviewing the development of wide&#8208;temperature SIBs, the influence of temperature on the parameters related to battery performance, such as reaction constant, charge transfer resistance, etc., is systematically and comprehensively analyzed. The review emphasizes challenges encountered by SIBs in both low and high temperatures while exploring recent advancements in SIB materials, specifically focusing on strategies to enhance battery performance across diverse temperature ranges. Overall, insights gained from these studies will drive the development of SIBs that can handle the challenges posed by diverse and harsh climates.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The article explores catalyst size evolution in Fenton&#8208;like reactions from nano to atomic scale. The review comprehensively discusses advanced characterization techniques and theoretical calculations for evaluating catalyst properties and reaction mechanisms. The size effect is closely associated with catalytic activities and behaviors by modulating metal&#8211;support interactions, electronic structures, and geometric configurations. Finally, the review summarizes recent advances in catalytic membranes and engineering applications of Fenton&#8208;like&#8208;based systems and proposes future perspectives in intelligent catalyst design.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Fenton&#8208;like reactions are crucial in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) for water purification. This review explores the latest advancements in heterogeneous metal&#8208;based catalysts within AOPs, covering nanoparticles (NPs), single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), and ultra&#8208;small atom clusters. A distinct connection between the physical properties of these catalysts, such as size, degree of unsaturation, electronic structure, and oxidation state, and their impacts on catalytic behavior and efficacy in Fenton&#8208;like reactions. In&#8208;depth comparative analysis of metal NPs and SACs is conducted focusing on how particle size variations and metal&#8208;support interactions affect oxidation species and pathways. The review highlights the cutting&#8208;edge characterization techniques and theoretical calculations, indispensable for deciphering the complex electronic and structural characteristics of active sites in downsized metal particles. Additionally, the review underscores innovative strategies for immobilizing these catalysts onto membrane surfaces, offering a solution to the inherent challenges of powdered catalysts. Recent advances in pilot&#8208;scale or engineering applications of Fenton&#8208;like&#8208;based devices are also summarized for the first time. The paper concludes by charting new research directions, emphasizing advanced catalyst design, precise identification of reactive oxygen species, and in&#8208;depth mechanistic studies. These efforts aim to enhance the application potential of nanotechnology&#8208;based AOPs in real&#8208;world wastewater treatment.

         <title>Immunoengineering Biomaterials for Musculoskeletal Tissue Repair across Lifespan</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 28, July 11, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses the intersection of the immune system and aging in biomaterial&#8208;mediated musculoskeletal tissue repair. The authors provide an overview of how aging impacts tissue physiology, immunity, and biomaterial responses. Then, the authors discuss the roles of the immune system in biomaterial&#8208;mediated repair of cartilage, muscle, and bone; and the impact of aging on biomaterial responses in these tissues.








Abstract
Musculoskeletal diseases and injuries are among the leading causes of pain and morbidity worldwide. Broad efforts have focused on developing pro&#8208;regenerative biomaterials to treat musculoskeletal conditions; however, these approaches have yet to make a significant clinical impact. Recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system is central in orchestrating tissue repair and that targeting pro&#8208;regenerative immune responses can improve biomaterial therapeutic outcomes. However, aging is a critical factor negatively affecting musculoskeletal tissue repair and immune function. Hence, understanding how age affects the response to biomaterials is essential for improving musculoskeletal biomaterial therapies. This review focuses on the intersection of the immune system and aging in response to biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair. The article introduces the general impacts of aging on tissue physiology, the immune system, and the response to biomaterials. Then, it explains how the adaptive immune system guides the response to injury and biomaterial implants in cartilage, muscle, and bone and discusses how aging impacts these processes in each tissue type. The review concludes by highlighting future directions for the development and translation of personalized immunomodulatory biomaterials for musculoskeletal tissue repair.

         <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Bloch Surface Wave Polaritons in Large&#8208;Area 2D Semiconductor Monolayers at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast pump&#8208;probe optical spectroscopy is used to study the room temperature excited state dynamics of the monolayer tungsten disulfine&#8208;based exciton&#8208;Bloch surface wave strongly coupled polaritonic systems. For above&#8208;exciton energy pumping, the decay of the exciton reservoir behaves as that of a bare monolayer. The transient response at the lower polariton resonance decays on an ultrashort time scale determined by the polariton lifetime, and subsequently follows the dynamic modification of strong coupling by photoexcited reservoir states.








Abstract
The dynamics of strongly coupled polariton systems integrated with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is key to enabling efficient coherent processes and achieving high&#8208;performance TMD&#8208;based polaritonic devices, such as ultralow&#8208;threshold polariton lasers and ultrafast optical switches. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the excited state dynamics in TMD&#8208;based polariton systems. In this work, ultrafast pump&#8208;probe optical spectroscopy is used to investigate the room temperature dynamics of the polariton systems consisting of TMD monolayer excitons strongly coupled with Bloch surface waves (BSWs) supported by all&#8208;dielectric photonic structures. The transient response is found for both above&#8208;exciton energy pumping and polariton&#8208;resonant pumping. The excited state population and ultrafast coherent coupling of the exciton reservoir and lower polariton (LP) branch are observed for resonant pumping.

     alt="Ultrafast Dynamics of Bloch Surface Wave Polaritons in Large-Area 2D Semiconductor Monolayers at Room Temperature"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrafast pump-probe optical spectroscopy is used to study the room temperature excited state dynamics of the monolayer tungsten disulfine-based exciton-Bloch surface wave strongly coupled polaritonic systems. For above-exciton energy pumping, the decay of the exciton reservoir behaves as that of a bare monolayer. The transient response at the lower polariton resonance decays on an ultrashort time scale determined by the polariton lifetime, and subsequently follows the dynamic modification of strong coupling by photoexcited reservoir states.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of strongly coupled polariton systems integrated with 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is key to enabling efficient coherent processes and achieving high-performance TMD-based polaritonic devices, such as ultralow-threshold polariton lasers and ultrafast optical switches. However, there has been a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the excited state dynamics in TMD-based polariton systems. In this work, ultrafast pump-probe optical spectroscopy is used to investigate the room temperature dynamics of the polariton systems consisting of TMD monolayer excitons strongly coupled with Bloch surface waves (BSWs) supported by all-dielectric photonic structures. The transient response is found for both above-exciton energy pumping and polariton-resonant pumping. The excited state population and ultrafast coherent coupling of the exciton reservoir and lower polariton (LP) branch are observed for resonant pumping. Moreover, it is found that the transient response of the LP first decays on a short-time scale of 0.15&#8211;0.25&#160;ps compared to the calculated intrinsic lifetime of 0.11&#8211;0.20&#160;ps, and is followed by a longer decay (&amp;gt;100&#160;ps) due to the dynamical evolution of the exciton reservoir. The results provide a fundamental understanding of the dynamics of TMD-based polariton systems while showing the potential for achieving efficient coherent optical processes for device applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tough Supramolecular Hydrogels Crafted via Lignin&#8208;Induced Self&#8208;Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular hydrogel forms by diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution, creating high&#8208;density crystalline domains and networks. This enhances mechanical properties (tensile strength: &#8776;20 Mpa, Young's modulus: &#8776;14 Mpa, toughness: &#8776;50 MJ&#160;m&#8315;3) and provides low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking (&#8776;100%). 









Abstract
Supramolecular hydrogels are typically assembled through weak non&#8208;covalent interactions, posing a significant challenge in achieving ultra strength. Developing a higher strength based on molecular/nanoscale engineering concepts is a potential improvement strategy. Herein, a super&#8208;tough supramolecular hydrogel is assembled by gradually diffusing lignosulfonate sodium (LS) into a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution. Both simulations and analytical results indicate that the assembly and subsequent enhancement of the crosslinked network are primarily attributed to LS&#8208;induced formation and gradual densification of strong crystalline domains within the hydrogel. The optimized hydrogel exhibits impressive mechanical properties with tensile strength of &#8776;20&#160;MPa, Young's modulus of &#8776;14&#160;MPa, and toughness of &#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8315;3, making it the strongest lignin&#8208;PVA/polymer hydrogel known so far. Moreover, LS provides the supramolecular hydrogel with excellent low&#8208;temperature stability (&lt;&#8208;60&#160;&#176;C), antibacterial, and UV&#8208;blocking capability (&#8776;100%). Interestingly, the diffusion ability of LS is demonstrated for self&#8208;restructuring damaged supramolecular hydrogel, achieving 3D patterning on hydrogel surfaces, and enhancing the local strength of the freeze&#8208;thaw PVA hydrogel. The goal is to foster a versatile hydrogel platform by combining eco&#8208;friendly LS with biocompatible PVA, paving the way for innovation and interdisciplinarity in biomedicine, engineering materials, and forestry science.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Engineered Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks as Nanocarriers for Pharmacotherapy: Insights into Intracellular Dynamics at The Single Particle Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A trifecta of preparation of defect&#8208;engineered nanoscale metal&#8211;organic frameworks (nanoMOFs), single particle tracking in live cells, and machine learning analysis to utilize nanoMOFs, as effective delivery vehicles of pharmaceutics in cells. Deciphering cell entry and delivery pathways of ATTO&#8208;UiO&#8208;66@Al by tracking their spatiotemporal localization and co&#8208;localization with endo&#8208;lysosomal compartments.








Abstract
Nanoscale Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks (nanoMOFs) are widely implemented in a host of assays involving drug delivery, biosensing catalysis, and bioimaging. However, the cell pathways and cell fate remain poorly understood. Here, a new fluorescent nanoMOF integrating ATTO 655 into surface defects of colloidal UiO&#8208;66 is synthesized, allowing to track the spatiotemporal localization of Single nanoMOF in live cells. density functional theory reveals the stronger binding of ATTO 655 to the Zr6 cluster nodes compared with phosphate and Alendronate Sodium. Parallelized tracking of the spatiotemporal localization of thousands of nanoMOFs and analysis using machine learning platforms reveals whether nanoMOFs remain outside as well as their cellular internalization pathways. To quantitatively assess their colocalization with endo/lysosomal compartments, a colocalization proxy approach relying on the nanoMOF detection of particles in one channel to the signal in the corresponding endo/lysosomal compartments channel, considering signal versus local background intensity ratio and signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio is developed. This strategy mitigates colocalization value inflation from high or low signal expression in endo/lysosomal compartments. The results accurately measure the nanoMOFs&#8217; colocalization from early to late endosomes and lysosomes and emphasize the importance of understanding their intracellular dynamics based on single&#8208;particle tracking for optimal and safe drug delivery.

         <title>Realizing Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism in Molecular&#8208;Intercalated Antiferromagnet VOCl</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intercalation of large organic molecules decouples the interlayer interaction of VOCl and induces the intralayer ferromagnetic (FM) coupling. Meanwhile, the intercalation also guides the charge injection, promotes the hybridization of 3d orbital electrons, and further strengthens the FM interaction, ultimately achieving the transition from pristine antiferromagnetism to room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropy.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets are gaining attention in fundamental physics and advanced spintronics, due to their unique dimension&#8208;dependent magnetism and potential for ultra&#8208;compact integration. However, achieving intrinsic ferromagnetism with high Curie temperature (TC) remains a technical challenge, including preparation and stability issues. Herein, an applicable electrochemical intercalation strategy to decouple interlayer interaction and guide charge doping in antiferromagnet VOCl, thereby inducing robust room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism, is developed. The expanded vdW gap isolates the neighboring layers and shrinks the distance between the V&#8208;V bond, favoring the generation of ferromagnetic (FM) coupling with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Element&#8208;specific X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) directly proves the source of the ferromagnetism. Detailed experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the charge doping enhances the FM interaction by promoting the orbital hybridization between t2g and eg. This work sheds new light on a promising way to achieve room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism in antiferromagnets, thus addressing the critical materials demand for designing spintronic devices.

         <title>Modular Assembly of Metamaterials Using Light Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light gradient forces, produced by a time&#8208;multiplexed optical standing wave, are used to assemble voxels consisting of nanoparticles into 3D structures on a hydrogel scaffold. Hundreds of nanoparticles can be manipulated into a complex heterogeneous voxel this way, and then the process can be repeated by stitching together voxels to form a metamaterial of any size, shape, and constituency.








Abstract
This is a report on a pilot study that tests the feasibility of assembling photonic metamaterials (PMs) using light gradient forces. Following a strategy that works like modular construction, light gradient forces, produced by a tightly focused, 1D standing wave optical trap, time&#8208;multiplexed across a 2D lattice are used to assemble voxels consisting of prefabricated, monodispersed nanoparticles (NPs) with radii ranging from 30 to 500&#160;nm into 3D structures on a hydrogel scaffold. Hundreds of NPs can be manipulated concurrently into a complex heterogeneous voxel this way, and then the process can be repeated by stitching together voxels to form a metamaterial of any size, shape, and constituency although imperfectly. Imperfections introduce random phase shifts and amplitude variations that can have an adverse effect on the band structure. Regardless, PMs are created this way using two different dielectric NPs, polystyrene and rutile, and then the near&#8208;infrared performance for each is analyzed with angle&#8208;, wavelength&#8208;, and polarization&#8208;dependent reflection spectroscopy. The cross&#8208;polarized spectra show evidence of a resonance peak. Interestingly, whereas the line shape from the polystyrene array is symmetric, the rutile array is not, which may be indicative of Fano resonance. So, even with the structural defects, reflection spectroscopy reveals a resonance.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Magnet&#8208;Free Spin Generation in a Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates creation of polarized electron spins in n&#8208;GaAs via the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect in nonmagnetic chiral molecular junctions. Spin accumulation in n&#8208;GaAs resulting from a charge current from a gold electrode through chiral molecules is evidenced by observation of the Hanle effect. The experiment points to a new scheme of fully nonmagnetic semiconductor spintronics. 








Abstract
Electrical generation and transduction of polarized electron spins in semiconductors (SCs) are of central interest in spintronics and quantum information science. While spin generation in SCs is frequently realized via electrical injection from a ferromagnet (FM), there are significant advantages in nonmagnetic pathways of creating spin polarization. One such pathway exploits the interplay of electron spin with chirality in electronic structures or real space. Here, utilizing chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS), the efficient creation of spin accumulation in n&#8208;doped GaAs via electric current injection from a normal metal (Au) electrode through a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) of chiral molecules (&#945;&#8208;helix l&#8208;polyalanine, AHPA&#8208;L), is demonstrated. The resulting spin polarization is detected as a Hanle effect in the n&#8208;GaAs, which is found to obey a distinct universal scaling with temperature and bias current consistent with chirality&#8208;induced spin accumulation. The experiment constitutes a definitive observation of CISS in a fully nonmagnetic device structure and demonstration of its ability to generate spin accumulation in a conventional SC. The results thus place key constraints on the physical mechanism of CISS and present a new scheme for magnet&#8208;free SC spintronics.

         <title>Optical Control of Adaptive Nanoscale Domain Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast optical pulse trains chart new pathways to produce a wide range of polar nanostructures in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, distinct from a supercrystal resulting from a strong single&#8208;shot excitation. The reconfigurations of these nanostructures&#160; are captured by in situ synchrotron&#8208;based x&#8208;ray nanodiffraction imaging upon light excitation. This work sheds nanoscopic insights into light&#8208;driven reconfigurable adaptive networks and opens the perspective of polar nanodomains in light&#8208;programable, ferroelectric&#8208;based synapse networks for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Adaptive networks can sense and adjust to dynamic environments to optimize their performance. Understanding their nanoscale responses to external stimuli is essential for applications in nanodevices and neuromorphic computing. However, it is challenging to image such responses on the nanoscale with crystallographic sensitivity. Here, the evolution of nanodomain networks in (PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n superlattices (SLs) is directly visualized in real space as the system adapts to ultrafast repetitive optical excitations that emulate controlled neural inputs. The adaptive response allows the system to explore a wealth of metastable states that are previously inaccessible. Their reconfiguration and competition are quantitatively measured by scanning x&#8208;ray nanodiffraction as a function of the number of applied pulses, in which crystallographic characteristics are quantitatively assessed by assorted diffraction patterns using unsupervised machine&#8208;learning methods. The corresponding domain boundaries and their connectivity are drastically altered by light, holding promise for light&#8208;programable nanocircuits in analogy to neuroplasticity. Phase&#8208;field simulations elucidate that the reconfiguration of the domain networks is a result of the interplay between photocarriers and transient lattice temperature. The demonstrated optical control scheme and the uncovered nanoscopic insights open opportunities for the remote control of adaptive nanoscale domain networks.

         <title>Nanometer Control of Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Interlayers by Thermal Evaporation for Efficient Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal co&#8208;evaporation is developed for the deposition of 2D and quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) Interlayers with nanometer control. Compared to untreated devices, thermally evaporated 2D materials on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites show improvement of 2% absolute efficiency reaching close to 22%.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) interlayers in lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) present processing challenges due to fast film formation and uncontrolled growth of phases and layer thickness at interfaces. In this work, an alternative, solvent&#8208;free, thermal co&#8208;evaporation process is developed to deposit RP interlayers. The method provides precise control on interlayer thickness and enables understanding its role on charge&#8208;carrier extraction. Studying RP film growth reveals the development of heterointerfaces when deposited on three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite layers. This allows a large thickness window with an optimum between 20 nm and 40 nm to improve the optoelectronic properties of the underlying 3D perovskite. Solar cells using evaporated interlayers achieve power conversion efficiency of 21.6%, compared to 19.6% for untreated devices, driven by improvements in the open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. This work sheds light on the importance of phase and thickness control of passivation layers, which ultimately determine the solar cell performance in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PSCs.

         <title>Unraveling Mechanism for Microstructure Engineering toward High&#8208;Capacity Nickel&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8211;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle is achieved in a tungsten(W)&#8208;introduced cathode through microstructure regulation. The modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries can effectively promote lithium ion&#160;transport and thus endow capacity enhancement. This work provides insights into the structure&#8208;performance relationship for the nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode.









Abstract
Microstructural engineering on nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide (NRLO) cathode materials is considered a promising approach to increase both the capacity and lifespan of lithium&#8208;ion batteries by introducing high valence&#8208;state elements. However, rational regulation on NRLO microstructures based on a deep understanding of its capacity enhancement mechanism remains challenging. Herein for the first time, it is demonstrated that an increase of 14&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 in reversible capacity at the first cycle can be achieved via tailoring the micro and nano structure of NRLO through introducing tungsten. Aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization reveals that the formation of a modified microstructure featured as coherent spinel twin boundaries. Theoretical modeling and electrochemical investigations further demonstrate that the capacity increase mechanism is related to such coherent spinel twin boundaries, which can lower the Li+ diffusion barrier and thus allow more Li+ to participate in deeper phase transitions. Meanwhile, the surface and grain boundaries of NRLOs are found to be modified by generating a dense and uniform LiWxOy phase, which further extends its cycle life by reducing side reactions with electrolytes. This work enables a comprehensive understanding of the capacity&#8208;increased mechanism and endows the remarkable potential of microstructural engineering for capacity&#8208; and lifespan&#8208;increased NRLOs.

         <title>Conformal Neuromorphic Bioelectronics for Sense Digitalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformal neuromorphic bioelectronics emerge for sense digitalization, enabling the perception of biological cues, edge data processing, and timely feedback. These devices are engineered to seamlessly integrate with biological components and hold immense potential for diverse applications such as soft humanoid robots, closed&#8208;loop intelligent diagnosis and treatment, and neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Sense digitalization, the process of transforming sensory experiences into digital data, is an emerging research frontier that links the physical world with human perception and interaction. Inspired by the adaptability, fault tolerance, robustness, and energy efficiency of&#160;biological senses, this field drives the development of numerous innovative digitalization techniques. Neuromorphic bioelectronics, characterized by biomimetic adaptability, stand out for their seamless bidirectional interactions with biological entities through stimulus&#8208;response and feedback loops, incorporating bio&#8208;neuromorphic intelligence for information exchange. This review illustrates recent progress in sensory digitalization, encompassing not only the digital representation of physical sensations such as touch, light, and temperature, correlating to tactile, visual, and thermal perceptions, but also the detection of biochemical stimuli such as gases, ions, and neurotransmitters, mirroring olfactory, gustatory, and neural processes. It thoroughly examines the material design, device manufacturing, and system integration, offering detailed insights. However, the field faces significant challenges, including the development of new device/system paradigms, forging genuine connections with biological systems, ensuring compatibility with the semiconductor industry and overcoming the absence of standardization. Future ambition includes realization of biocompatible neural prosthetics, exoskeletons, soft humanoid robots, and cybernetic devices that integrate smoothly with both biological tissues and artificial components.

         <title>Ordered Transfer from 3D&#8208;Oriented MOF Superstructures to Polymeric Films: Microfabrication, Enhanced Chemical Stability, and Anisotropic Fluorescent Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) films are used as templates for the fabrication of oriented porous polymer films and patterns. MOF films are prepared via heteroepitaxial growth; X&#8208;ray sensitivity is achieved using an azide&#8208;functionalized linker. X&#8208;ray irradiation degrades the MOF film in exposed regions; masked areas are cross&#8208;linked via azide&#8208;alkyne coupling. Acidic treatment affords polymeric films and patterns with anisotropic fluorescent properties.








Abstract
Films and patterns of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) afford well&#8208;ordered pore structures extending across centimeter&#8208;scale areas. These macroscopic domains of aligned pores are pivotal to enhance diffusion along specific pathways and orient functional guests. The anisotropic properties emerging from this alignment are beneficial for applications in ion conductivity and photonics. However, the structure of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF films and patterns can rapidly degrade under humid and acidic conditions. Thus, more durable 3D&#8208;ordered porous systems are desired for practical applications. Here, oriented porous polymer films and patterns are prepared by using heteroepitaxially oriented N3&#8208;functionalized MOF films as precursor materials. The film fabrication protocol utilizes an azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition on the Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO MOF. The micropatterning protocol exploits the X&#8208;ray sensitivity of azide groups in Cu2(AzBPDC)2DABCO, enabling selective degradation in the irradiated areas. The masked regions of the MOF film retain their N3&#8208;functionality, allowing for subsequent cross&#8208;linking through azide&#8208;alkyne coupling. Subsequent acidic treatment removes the Cu ions from the MOF, yielding porous polymer micro&#8208;patterns. The polymer has high chemical stability and shows an anisotropic fluorescent response. The use of 3D&#8208;oriented MOF systems as precursors for the fabrication of oriented porous polymers will facilitate the progress of optical components for photonic applications.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Melt&#8208;Processing of Birefringent Cellulosic Materials for Eco&#8208;Friendly Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. With customizable processing forms, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, recyclability, and biodegradability. The diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
Ubiquitous anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials with a rapidly rising annual consumption (over 1010&#160;m2) can pose a serious environmental burden. Biobased cellulosic materials with birefringence offer attractive sustainable alternatives, but their scalable solvent&#8208;free processing remain challenging. Here, a dynamic chemical modification strategy is proposed for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of birefringent cellulosic materials for eco&#8208;friendly anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Relying on the thermal&#8208;activated dynamic covalent&#8208;locking of the spatial topological structure of preferred oriented cellulose, the strategy balances the contradiction between the strong confinement of long&#8208;range ordered structures and the molecular motility required for entropically&#8208;driven reconstruction. Equipped with customizable processing forms including mold&#8208;pressing, spinning, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, and blade&#8208;coating, the materials exhibit a wide color gamut, self&#8208;healing efficiency (94.5%), recyclability, and biodegradability. Moreover, the diversified flexible elements facilitate scalable fabrication and compatibility with universal processing techniques, thereby enabling versatile and programmable anti&#8208;counterfeiting. The strategy is expected to provide references for multi&#8208;modal melt&#8208;processing of cellulose and promote sustainable innovation in the anti&#8208;counterfeiting industry.

         <title>A Soldering Flux Tackles Complex Defects Chemistry in Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abietic acid (AA), a soldering flux, is introduced into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cells to tackle complex defects chemistry. The C&#9552;C bond within AA continuously eliminates Sn4+ and Pb0 defects, while the presence of C&#9552;O bond enhances the antioxidation stability of Sn2+. This innovative and effective approach leads to 23.42% power conversion efficiency of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cell.








Abstract
Developing tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites is crucial for the deployment of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, which can help to exceed the limits of single&#8208;junction photovoltaics. However, the Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite suffers from a large number of bulk traps and interfacial nonradiative recombination centers, with unsatisfactory open&#8208;circuit voltage and the consequent device efficiency. Herein, for the first time, it is shown that abietic acid (AA), a commonly used flux for metal soldering, effectively tackles complex defects chemistry in Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. The conjugated double bond within AA molecule plays a key role for self&#8208;elimination of Sn4+&#8208;Pb0 defects pair, via a redox process. In addition, C&#9552;O group is able to coordinate with Sn2+, leading to the improved antioxidative stability of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Consequently, a ten&#8208;times longer carrier lifetime is observed, and the defects&#8208;associated dual&#8208;peak emission feature at low temperature is significantly inhibited. The resultant device achieves a power conversion efficiency improvement from 22.28% (Ref) to 23.42% with respectable stability under operational and illumination situations.

         <title>Vertically Phase Separated Photomultiplication Organic Photodetectors with p&#8208;n Heterojunction Type Ultrafast Dynamic Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;type organic photodetectors (OPDs), which typically form a homogeneous distribution (HD) of n&#8208;type dopants in a p&#8208;type polymer host (HD PM&#8208;type OPDs), have achieved a breakthrough in device responsivity by surpassing a theoretical limit of external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, they face limitations in higher dark current and slower dynamic characteristics compared to p&#8208;n heterojunction (p&#8208;n HJ) OPDs due to inherent long lifetime of trapped electrons. To overcome this, we have developed a new PM&#8208;type OPD that demonstrates ultrafast dynamic properties through a vertical phase separation (VPS) strategy between the p&#8208;type polymer (host) and n&#8208;type acceptor (dopant), referred to as VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs. Notably, VPS PM&#8208;type OPDs show a remarkable increase (by three orders of magnitude) in &#8722;3&#160;dB cut&#8208;off frequency (120&#160;kHz) and over a 200&#8208;fold faster response time (rising time = 4.8 &#181;s, falling time = 8.3 &#181;s) compared to HD PM&#8208;type OPDs, while maintaining high EQE of 1,121% and specific detectivity of 2.53 &#215; 1013 Jones at &#8211;10&#160;V. The VPS PM OPD represents a groundbreaking advancement by demonstrating the coexistence of p&#8208;n HJ and PM modes within a single photoactive layer for the first time. This innovative approach holds the potential to enhance both static and dynamic properties of OPDs.

Abstract
The organic&#8208;inorganic lead halide perovskite materials have emerged as highly promising contenders in the field of photovoltaic technology, offering exceptional efficiency and cost&#8208;effectiveness. The commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics hinges on successfully transitioning from lab&#8208;scale perovskite solar cells to large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules (PSMs). However, the efficiency of PSMs significantly diminishes with increasing device area, impeding commercial viability. Central to achieving high&#8208;efficiency PSMs is fabricating uniform functional films and optimizing interfaces to minimize energy loss. In this review, we shed light on the path towards large&#8208;scale PSMs, emphasizing the pivotal role of integrating cutting&#8208;edge scientific research with industrial technology. By exploring scalable deposition techniques and optimization strategies, we reveal the advancements and challenges in fabricating large&#8208;area perovskite films. Subsequently, we delve into the architecture and contact materials of PSMs while addressing pertinent interface issues. Crucially, we analyze efficiency loss during scale&#8208;up and stability risks encountered by PSMs. Furthermore, we highlight the advancements in industrial efforts towards perovskite commercialization, emphasizing the perspective of PSMs in revolutionizing renewable energy. By highlighting the scientific and technical challenges in developing PSMs, we stress the importance of combining science and industry to drive their industrialization and pave the way for future advancements.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Nanowelding of Bilayer SnSe Nanoplates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;free nanowelding between 2D group&#8208;IV monochalcogenide ferroelectric semiconductor nanoplates is achieved by perfectly aligning their crystalline orientations using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip, with the assistance of the anisotropic lubricity between the nanoplates and a graphene substrate.








Abstract
Nanowelding is a bottom&#8208;up technique to create custom&#8208;designed nanostructures and devices beyond the precision of lithographic methods. Here, a new technique is reported based on anisotropic lubricity at the van der Waals interface between monolayer and bilayer SnSe nanoplates and a graphene substrate to achieve precise control of the crystal orientation and the interface during the welding process. As&#8208;grown SnSe monolayer and bilayer nanoplates are commensurate with graphene's armchair direction but lack commensuration along graphene's zigzag direction, resulting in a reduced friction along that direction and a rail&#8208;like, 1D movement that permits joining nanoplates with high precision. This way, molecular beam epitaxially grown SnSe nanoplates of lateral sizes 30&#8211;100&#160;nm are manipulated by the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope at room temperature. In situ annealing is applied afterward to weld contacting nanoplates without atomic defects at the interface. This technique can be generalized to any van der Waals interfaces with anisotropic lubricity and is highly promising for the construction of complex quantum devices, such as field effect transistors, quantum interference devices, lateral tunneling junctions, and solid&#8208;state qubits.

         <title>Balancing Pd&#8211;H Interactions: Thiolate&#8208;Protected Palladium Nanoclusters for Robust and Rapid Hydrogen Gas Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiolate&#8208;protected palladium nanoclusters (Pd8SR16) enhance hydrogen gas (H2) sensing by leveraging metal&#8208; thiolate synergy, balancing palladium&#8211;hydrogen (Pd&#8211;H) interactions, and preventing excessive binding and phase transitions. Pd8SR16 surpass traditional Pd metals in durability and reversibility, enabling rapid H2 detection at parts per million (ppm) levels. A portable, wireless prototype highlights the practicality of ligand&#8208;protected nanoclusters in real&#8208;world scenarios.








Abstract
The transition toward hydrogen gas (H2) as an eco&#8208;friendly and renewable energy source necessitates advanced safety technologies, particularly robust sensors for H2 leak detection and concentration monitoring. Although palladium (Pd)&#8208;based materials are preferred for their strong H2 affinity, intense palladium&#8211;hydrogen (Pd&#8211;H) interactions lead to phase transitions to palladium hydride (PdHx), compromising sensors&#8217; durability and detection speeds after multiple uses. In response, this study introduces a high&#8208;performance H2 sensor designed from thiolate&#8208;protected Pd nanoclusters (Pd8SR16), which leverages the synergistic effect between the metal and protective ligands to form an intermediate palladium&#8211;hydrogen&#8211;sulfur (Pd&#8211;H&#8211;S) state during H2 adsorption. Striking a balance, it preserves Pd&#8211;H binding affinity while preventing excessive interaction, thus lowering the energy required for H2 desorption. The dynamic adsorption&#8208;dissociation&#8208;recombination&#8208;desorption process is efficiently and highly reversible with Pd8SR16, ensuring robust and rapid H2 sensing at parts per million (ppm). The Pd8SR16&#8208;based sensor demonstrates exceptional stability (50 cycles; 0.11% standard deviation in response), prompt response/recovery (t90 = 0.95 s/6 s), low limit of detection (LoD, 1&#160;ppm), and ambient temperature operability, ranking it among the most sensitive Pd&#8208;based H2 sensors. Furthermore, a multifunctional prototype demonstrates the practicality of real&#8208;world gas sensing using ligand&#8208;protected metal nanoclusters.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief overview of the mechanisms of actions of osmotic energy conversion systems along with the strategies employed to promote the energy conversion efficiency is provided. Pioneering efforts in designing advanced membranes that exhibit high energy conversion performances are highlighted. Existing challenges and prospects in the field of osmotic energy conversion are explored.








Abstract
Osmotic energy, often referred to as &#8220;blue energy&#8221;, is the energy generated from the mixing of solutions with different salt concentrations, offering a vast, renewable, and environmentally friendly energy resource. The efficacy of osmotic power production considerably relies on the performance of the transmembrane process, which depends on ionic conductivity and the capability to differentiate between positive and negative ions. Recent advancements have led to the development of membrane materials featuring precisely tailored ion transport nanochannels, enabling high&#8208;efficiency osmotic energy harvesting. In this review, ion diffusion in confined nanochannels and the rational design and optimization of membrane architecture are explored. Furthermore, structural optimization of the membrane to mitigate transport resistance and the concentration polarization effect for enhancing osmotic energy harvesting is highlighted. Finally, an outlook on the challenges that lie ahead is provided, and the potential applications of osmotic energy conversion are outlined. This review offers a comprehensive viewpoint on the evolving prospects of osmotic energy conversion.

         <title>From Lab to Application: Challenges and Opportunities in Achieving Fast Charging with Polyanionic Cathodes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fast charging alleviates range anxiety in sodium&#8208;ion batteries caused by limited energy density. This review focuses on the fast&#8208;charging design of polyanionic cathodes and proposes innovative modification strategy classifications&#8212;from shortening migration paths to increasing diffusion coefficients. Discussions extend from coin cells to pouch cells, aiming to provide insights into high&#8208;rate polyanionic materials, emphasizing their significant potential in fast&#8208;charging applications.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), recognized for balanced energy density and cost&#8208;effectiveness, are positioned as a promising complement to lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) and a substitute for lead&#8211;acid batteries, particularly in low&#8208;speed electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage. Despite their extensive potential, concerns about range anxiety due to lower energy density underscore the importance of fast&#8208;charging technologies, which drives the exploration of high&#8208;rate electrode materials. Polyanionic cathode materials are emerging as promising candidates in this regard. However, their intrinsic limitation in electronic conductivity poses challenges for synchronized electron and ion transport, hindering their suitability for fast&#8208;charging applications. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of sodium ion migration during charging/discharging, highlighting it as a critical rate&#8208;limiting step for fast charging. By delving into intrinsic dynamics, key factors that constrain fast&#8208;charging characteristics are identified and summarized. Innovative modification routes are then introduced, with a focus on shortening migration paths and increasing diffusion coefficients, providing detailed insights into feasible strategies. Moreover, the discussion extends beyond half cells to full cells, addressing challenges and opportunities in transitioning polyanionic materials from the laboratory to practical applications. This review aims to offer valuable insights into the development of high&#8208;rate polyanionic cathodes, acknowledging their pivotal role in advancing fast&#8208;charging SIBs.

         <title>Expanding RNAi to Kidneys, Lungs, and Spleen via Selective ORgan Targeting (SORT) siRNA Lipid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
siRNA SORT lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) facilitate durable extrahepatic silencing in kidneys, lungs, and spleen. The study is expanding preclinical landscape of intravenously administered siRNA&#8208;based medicines presently limited to liver. LNPs excel at dose&#8208;dependent downregulation of tissue&#8208;enriched endogenous targets yielding up to 80% silencing after single IV injection. Unbiased knockdown of constitutively expressing TdTomato is reported across therapeutically relevant cell types in B6.129TdTom/EGFP mice.








Abstract
Inhibition of disease&#8208;causing mutations using RNA interference (RNAi) has resulted in clinically approved medicines with additional candidates in late stage trials. However, targetable tissues currently in preclinical development are limited to liver following systemic intravenous (IV) administration because predictable delivery of siRNA to non&#8208;liver tissues remains an unsolved challenge. Here, evidence of durable extrahepatic gene silencing enabled by siRNA Selective ORgan Targeting lipid nanoparticles (siRNA SORT LNPs) to the kidneys, lungs, and spleen is provided. LNPs excel at dose&#8208;dependent silencing of tissue&#8208;enriched endogenous targets resulting in 60%&#8211;80% maximal knockdown after a single IV injection and up to 88% downregulation of protein expression in mouse lungs after two doses. To examine knockdown potency and unbiased organ targeting, B6.129TdTom/EGFP mice that constitutively express the TdTomato transgene across all cell types are utilized to demonstrate 58%, 45%, and 15% reduction in TdTomato fluorescence in lungs, spleen, and kidneys, respectively. Finally, physiological relevance of siRNA SORT LNP&#8208;mediated gene silencing is established via acute suppression of endogenous Tie2 which induces lung&#8208;specific phenotypic alteration of vascular endothelial barrier. Due to plethora of extrahepatic diseases that may benefit from RNAi interventions, it is anticipated that the findings will expand preclinical landscape of therapeutic targets beyond the liver.

         <title>Reverse Hydrogen Spillover on Metal Oxides for Water&#8208;Promoted Catalytic Oxidation Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, this work unravels the water&#8208;effected mechanisms on the metal oxide surface during ethanol oxidation reactions through various in situ surface sensitive spectroscopies: i) the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites leads to water poisoning; ii) the proton&#8208;induced active *OOH species, achieved by accelerated reverse hydrogen spillover among metal oxides, enhances water&#8208;promoted functionality.








Abstract
Understanding the water&#8208;involved mechanism on metal oxide surface and the dynamic interaction of water with active sites is crucial in solving water poisoning in catalytic reactions. Herein, this work solves this problem by designing the water&#8208;promoted function of metal oxides in the ethanol oxidation reaction. In situ multimodal spectroscopies unveil that the competitive adsorption of water&#8208;dissociated *OH species with O2 at Sn active sites results in water poisoning and the sluggish proton transfer in CoO&#8208;SnO2 imparts water&#8208;resistant effect. Carbon material as electron donor and proton transport channel optimizes the Co active sites and expedites the reverse hydrogen spillover from CoO to SnO2. The water&#8208;promoted function arises from spillover protons facilitating O2 activation on the SnO2 surface, leading to crucial *OOH intermediate formation for catalyzing C&#8208;H and C&#8208;C cleavage. Consequently, the tailored CoO&#8208;C&#8208;SnO2 showcases a remarkable 60&#8208;fold enhancement in ethanol oxidation reaction compared to bare SnO2 under high&#8208;humidity conditions.

         <title>Bifunctional Catalysts for CO2 Reduction and O2 Evolution: A Pivotal for Aqueous Rechargeable Zn&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In pursuit of green energy storage and decarbonization by safe and economical Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries, the design and development of CO2 reduction&#8208;O2 evolution active bifunctional cathode catalyst in neutral pH is pivotal. Existing challenges for the same are discussed in this review with the strategic plan of action to improve and revolutionize the system up to practical standards.








Abstract
The quest for the advancement of green energy storage technologies and reduction of carbon footprint is determinedly rising toward carbon neutrality. Aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 batteries (ARZCBs) hold the great potential to encounter both the targets simultaneously, i.e., green energy storage and CO2 conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals/fuels. The major descriptor of ARZCBs efficiency is allied with the reactions occurring at cathode during discharging (CO2 reduction) and charging (O2 evolution) which own different fundamental mechanisms and hence mandate the employment of two different catalysts. This presents an overall complex and expensive battery system which requires a concrete solution, while the development and application of a bifunctional cathode catalyst toward both reactions could reduce the complexity and cost and thus can be a pivotal for ARZCBs. However, despite the increasing research interest and ongoing research, a systematic evaluation of bifunctional catalysts is rarely reported. In this review, the need of bifunctional cathode catalysts for ARZCBs and associated challenges with strategies have been critically assessed. A detailed progress examination and understanding toward designing of bifunctional catalyst for ARZCBs have been provided. This review will enlighten the future research approaching boosted performance of ARZCBs through the development of efficient bifunctional cathode catalysts.

         <title>Bipolar Textile Composite Electrodes Enabling Flexible Tandem Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) is fabricated by sandwiching the nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) with the cathode and Li metal anode layers. The energy density of BTCE&#8208;based solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries increases significantly. More impressively, benefiting from the outstanding flexibility of BTCE, the pouch cell shows zero capacity decay under thousands of bending and folding tests.








Abstract
A majority of flexible and wearable electronics require high operational voltage that is conventionally achieved by serial connection of battery unit cells using external wires. However, this inevitably decreases the energy density of the battery module and may cause additional safety hazards. Herein, a bipolar textile composite electrode (BTCE) that enables internal tandem&#8208;stacking configuration to yield high&#8208;voltage (6 to 12&#160;V class) solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) is reported. BTCE is comprised of a nickel&#8208;coated poly(ethylene terephthalate) fabric (NiPET) core layer, a cathode coated on one side of the NiPET, and a Li metal anode coated on the other side of the NiPET. Stacking BTCEs with solid&#8208;state electrolytes alternatively leads to the extension of output voltage and decreased usage of inert package materials, which in turn significantly boosts the energy density of the battery. More importantly, the BTCE&#8208;based SSLMB possesses remarkable capacity retention per cycle of over 99.98% over cycling. The composite structure of BTCE also enables outstanding flexibility; the battery keeps stable charge/discharge characteristics over thousands of bending and folding. BTCE shows great promise for future safe, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and flexible SSLMBs for a wide range of flexible and wearable electronics.

         <title>Sliding Memristor in Parallel&#8208;Stacked Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type memristor called &#8220;sliding memristor&#8221; based on graphene/parallel&#8208;stacked hexagonal boron nitride/graphene tunneling device is fabricated with tunable memristive windows and switchable high resistance state/low resistance state transitions induced by the coupling between ferroelectric polarization and conductive filament formation, bridging the gap between sliding ferroelectricity and memory applications.








Abstract
Sliding ferroelectricity in 2D materials, arising from interlayer sliding&#8208;induced interlayer hybridization and charge redistribution at the van der Waals interface, offers a means to manipulate spontaneous polarization at the atomic scale through various methods such as stacking order, interfacial contact, and electric field. However, the practical application of extending 2D sliding ferroelectricity remains challenging due to the contentious mechanisms and the complex device structures required for ferroelectric switching. Here, a sliding memristor based on a graphene/parallel&#8208;stacked hexagonal boron nitride/graphene tunneling device, featuring a stable memristive hysteresis induced by interfacial polarizations and barrier height modulations, is presented. As the tunneling current density increases, the memristive window broadens, achieving an on/off ratio of &#8776;103 and 2 order decrease of the trigger current density, attributed to the interlayer migration of positively charged boron ions and the formation of conductive filaments, as supported by the theoretical calculations. The findings open a path for exploring the sliding memristor via a tunneling device and bridge the gap between sliding ferroelectricity and memory applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Fidelity Bioelectrodes with Bidirectional Ion&#8211;Electron Transduction Capability by Integrating Multiple Charge&#8208;Transfer Processes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergy of multiple charge&#8208;transfer pathways upon a wide range of frequencies successfully yields multifunctional high&#8208;fidelity bioelectrodes, which surpass their counterparts relying solely on a single charge&#8208;transfer pathway in terms of operatable frequency range, noise reduction, charge injection capability, and multifunctionalities.








Abstract
Bioelectronics is an exciting field that bridges the gap between physiological activities and external electronic devices, striving for high resolution, high conformability, scalability, and ease of integration. One crucial component in bioelectronics is bioelectrodes, designed to convert neural activity into electronic signals or vice versa. Previously reported bioelectrodes have struggled to meet several essential requirements simultaneously: high&#8208;fidelity signal transduction, high charge injection capability, strain resistance, and multifunctionality. This work introduces a novel strategy for fabricating superior bioelectrodes by merging multiple charge&#8208;transfer processes. The resulting bioelectrodes offer accurate ion&#8208;to&#8208;electron transduction for capturing electrophysiological signals, dependable charge injection capability for neuromodulation, consistent electrode potential for artifact rejection and biomolecule sensing, and high transparency for seamless integration with optoelectronics. Furthermore, the bioelectrode can be designed to be strain&#8208;insensitive by isolating signal transduction from electron transportation. The innovative concept presented in this work holds great promise for extending to other electrode materials and paves the way for the advancement of multimodal bioelectronics.

         <title>Biomimetic Mechanical Robust Cement&#8208;Resin Composites with Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Gradient Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A scalable bottom&#8208;up approach is proposed to fabricate a novel biomimetic cement&#8208;resin composite with gradient hierarchical structure, the toughness and impact resistance of such composite attractively surpass the cement counterparts by factors of approximately 700 and 600 times, and even outperform natural rocks, fiber&#8208;reinforced cement&#8208;based materials, and even some alloys.








Abstract
Biological materials relying on hierarchically ordered architectures inspire the emergence of advanced composites with mutually exclusive mechanical properties, but the efficient topology optimization and large&#8208;scale manufacturing remain challenging. Herein, this work proposes a scalable bottom&#8208;up approach to fabricate a novel nacre&#8208;like cement&#8208;resin composite with gradient brick&#8208;and&#8208;mortar (BM) structure, and demonstrates a machine learning&#8208;assisted method to optimize the gradient structure. The fabricated gradient composite exhibits an extraordinary combination of high flexural strength, toughness, and impact resistance. Particularly, the toughness and impact resistance of such composite attractively surpass the cement counterparts by factors of approximately 700 and 600 times, and even outperform natural rocks, fiber&#8208;reinforced cement&#8208;based materials and even some alloys. The strengthening and toughening mechanisms are clarified as the regional&#8208;matrix densifying and crack&#8208;tip shielding effects caused by the gradient BM structure. The developed gradient composite not only endows a promising structural material for protective applications in harsh scenarios, but also paves a new way for biomimetic metamaterials designing.

         <title>Unlocking Efficiency: Minimizing Energy Loss in Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oversight of catalyst energy consumption in water electrolysis stems from intricate catalyst&#8208;microstructure relationships, electrolyte interactions, and electrode resistance. Strategies to address this include enhancing mass exchange, facilitating charge transfer among catalyst particles, and utilizing low&#8208;resistance current collectors. These insights prompt the potential application of hierarchically structured electrodes to mitigate energy usage in electrolysis.








Abstract
Catalysts play a crucial role in water electrolysis by reducing the energy barriers for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). Research aims to enhance the intrinsic activities of potential catalysts through material selection, microstructure design, and various engineering techniques. However, the energy consumption of catalysts has often been overlooked due to the intricate interplay among catalyst microstructure, dimensionality, catalyst&#8211;electrolyte&#8211;gas dynamics, surface chemistry, electron transport within electrodes, and electron transfer among electrode components. Efficient catalyst development for high&#8208;current&#8208;density applications is essential to meet the increasing demand for green hydrogen. This involves transforming catalysts with high intrinsic activities into electrodes capable of sustaining high current densities. This review focuses on current improvement strategies of mass exchange, charge transfer, and reducing electrode resistance to decrease energy consumption. It aims to bridge the gap between laboratory&#8208;developed, highly efficient catalysts and industrial applications regarding catalyst structural design, surface chemistry, and catalyst&#8208;electrode interplay, outlining the development roadmap of hierarchically structured electrode&#8208;based water electrolysis for minimizing energy loss in electrocatalysts for water splitting.

         <title>Inhibiting Interfacial Nonradiative Recombination in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with a Multifunctional Molecule</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interface&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination losses are significantly limiting the performance improvement in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). A multifunctional dipole molecule modifies the perovskite surface to reduce&#160;defects and optimize energy alignment, suppressing the nonradiative recombination. The p&#8208;i&#8208;n device achieves an improved efficiency that stabilizes under both high humidity and maximum power point tracking.









Abstract
Interface&#8208;induced nonradiative recombination losses at the perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL) are an impediment to improving the efficiency and stability of inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Tridecafluorohexane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid potassium (TFHSP) is employed as a multifunctional dipole molecule to modify the perovskite surface. The solid coordination and hydrogen bonding efficiently passivate the surface defects, thereby reducing nonradiative recombination. The induced positive dipole layer between the perovskite and ETLs improves the energy band alignment, enhancing interface charge extraction. Additionally, the strong interaction between TFHSP and the perovskite stabilizes the perovskite surface, while the hydrophobic fluorinated moieties prevent the ingress of water and oxygen, enhancing the device stability. The resultant devices achieve&#160;a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.6%. The unencapsulated devices retain&#160;91% of their initial efficiency after 1000 h in air with 60% relative humidity, and 95% after 500 h under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 35&#160;&#176;C. The utilization of multifunctional dipole molecules opens new avenues for high&#8208;performance and long&#8208;term stable perovskite devices.

         <title>Water Transport&#8208;Induced Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation Facilitates Gelation for Controllable and Facile Fabrication of Physically Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water transport within the emulsion system is found to be able to trigger not only the liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation within aqueous droplets, but also a consecutive sol&#8211;gel transition. This phenomenon enables the invention of a physically crosslinked microgel fabrication system, which is controllable, facile, and possesses high potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Physically crosslinked microgels (PCMs) offer a biocompatible platform for various biomedical applications. However, current PCM fabrication methods suffer from their complexity and poor controllability, due to their reliance on altering physical conditions to initiate gelation and their dependence on specific materials. To address this issue, a novel PCM fabrication method is devised, which employs water transport&#8208;induced liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) to trigger the intermolecular interaction&#8208;supported sol&#8211;gel transition within aqueous emulsion droplets. This method enables the controllable and facile generation of PCMs through a single emulsification step, allowing for the facile production of PCMs with various materials and sizes, as well as controllable structures and mechanical properties. Moreover, this PCM fabrication method holds great promise for diverse biomedical applications. The interior of the PCM not only supports the encapsulation and proliferation of bacteria but also facilitates the encapsulation of eukaryotic cells after transforming the system into an all&#8208;aqueous emulsion. Furthermore, through appropriate surface functionalization, the PCMs effectively activate T cells in vitro upon coculturing. This work represents an advancement in PCM fabrication and offers new insights and perspectives for microgel engineering.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in energy harvesters, wireless energy transfer, and energy storage are reviewed, emphasizing the crucial role of advanced materials in achieving a future where wearable and implantable medical devices are self&#8208;powered, eliminating the need for battery replacement or manual recharging.








Abstract
Wearable and implantable active medical devices (WIMDs) are transformative solutions for improving healthcare, offering continuous health monitoring, early disease detection, targeted treatments, personalized medicine, and connected health capabilities. Commercialized WIMDs use primary or rechargeable batteries to power their sensing, actuation, stimulation, and communication functions, and periodic battery replacements of implanted active medical devices pose major risks of surgical infections or inconvenience to users. Addressing the energy source challenge is critical for meeting the growing demand of the WIMD market that is reaching valuations in the tens of billions of dollars. This review critically assesses the recent advances in energy harvesting and storage technologies that can potentially eliminate the need for battery replacements. With a key focus on advanced materials that can enable energy harvesters to meet the energy needs of WIMDs, this review examines the crucial roles of advanced materials in improving the efficiencies of energy harvesters, wireless charging, and energy storage devices. This review concludes by highlighting the key challenges and opportunities in advanced materials necessary to achieve the vision of self&#8208;powered wearable and implantable active medical devices, eliminating the risks associated with surgical battery replacement and the inconvenience of frequent manual recharging.

         <title>A Highly Stretchable, Conductive, and Transparent Bioadhesive Hydrogel as a Flexible Sensor for Enhanced Real&#8208;Time Human Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An elastic, skin&#8208;adhesive, biocompatible, and biodegradable hydrogel&#8208;based wearable sensor has been developed for human health monitoring, inspired by pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring hydrogels. This novel hydrogel&#8208;based sensor offers high accuracy and mechanical strength, 3D printability, passive cooling, UV resistance, self&#8208;healing, and durability. With tunable properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, the engineered hydrogel&#8208;based sensor shows significant potential for real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring in human movement and motor dysfunction applications.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time continuous monitoring of non&#8208;cognitive markers is crucial for the early detection and management of chronic conditions. Current diagnostic methods are often invasive and not suitable for at&#8208;home monitoring. An elastic, adhesive, and biodegradable hydrogel&#8208;based wearable sensor with superior accuracy and durability for monitoring real&#8208;time human health is developed. Employing a supramolecular engineering strategy, a pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring hydrogel is synthesized by combining polyacrylamide (pAAm), &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin (&#946;&#8208;CD), and poly 2&#8208;(acryloyloxy)ethyltrimethylammonium chloride (AETAc) bio ionic liquid (Bio&#8208;IL). This novel approach decouples conflicting mechano&#8211;chemical effects arising from different molecular building blocks and provides a balance of mechanical toughness (1.1 &#215; 106 Jm&#8722;3), flexibility, conductivity (&#8776;0.29 S m&#8722;1), and tissue adhesion (&#8776;27&#160;kPa), along with rapid self&#8208;healing and remarkable stretchability (&#8776;3000%). Unlike traditional hydrogels, the one&#8208;pot synthesis avoids chemical crosslinkers and metallic nanofillers, reducing cytotoxicity. While the pAAm provides mechanical strength, the formation of the pseudo&#8208;slide&#8208;ring structure ensures&#160;high stretchability and flexibility. Combining pAAm with &#946;&#8208;CD and pAETAc enhances biocompatibility and biodegradability, as confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies. The hydrogel also offers transparency, passive&#8208;cooling, ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;shielding, and 3D printability, enhancing its practicality for everyday use. The engineered sensor demonstratesimproved efficiency, stability, and sensitivity in motion/haptic sensing, advancing real&#8208;time human healthcare monitoring.

         <title>A Superparamagnetic Composite Hydrogel Scaffold as In Vivo Dynamic Monitorable Theranostic Platform for Osteoarthritis Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic material, composite hydrogel scaffold (CHS), is synthesized based on glycidyl methacrylate modified hyaluronic acid (GMHA) and hollow porous magnetic hydroxyapatite&#8208;Fe3O4 microspheres. The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)&#8208;loaded CHS exhibits subchondral bone repair function and achieves high cartilage repair scores. Its process can dynamically monitor using MRI. The CHS provides a versatile platform for osteoarthritis (OA) treatment.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disease, characterized by subchondral fractures in its initial stages, which has no precise and specific treatment now. Here, a novel multifunctional scaffold is synthesized by photopolymerizing glycidyl methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (GMHA) as the matrix in the presence of hollow porous magnetic microspheres based on hydroxyapatite. In vivo subchondral bone repairing results demonstrate that the scaffold's meticulous design has most suitable properties for subchondral bone repair. The porous structure of inorganic particles within the scaffold facilitates efficient transport of loaded exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The Fe3O4 nanoparticles assembled in microspheres promote the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and accelerate the new bone generation. These features enable the scaffold to exhibit favorable subchondral bone repair properties and attain high cartilage repair scores. The therapy results prove that the subchondral bone support considerably influences the upper cartilage repair process. Furthermore, magnetic resonance imaging monitoring demonstrates that Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which are gradually replaced by new bone during osteochondral defect repair, allow a noninvasive and radiation&#8208;free assessment to track the newborn bone during the OA repair process. The composite hydrogel scaffold (CHS) provides a versatile platform for biomedical applications in OA treatment.

         <title>A General Approach to Activate Second&#8208;Scale Room Temperature Photoluminescence in Organic Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong room temperature phosphorescence, thought only to be accessible in a small number of compounds, is ubiquitously activated in 22 common organic chromophores. Dispersing them as submicron aggregates in a rigid polymer matrix suppresses nonradiative recombination by limiting intramolecular motion and minimizes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation typically seen in the bulk. These films can glow for up to 10 s after ceasing excitation.








Abstract
Organic small molecules that exhibit second&#8208;scale phosphorescence at room temperature are of interest for potential applications in sensing, anticounterfeiting, and bioimaging. However, such materials systems are uncommon&#8212;requiring millisecond to second&#8208;scale triplet lifetimes, efficient intersystem crossing, and slow rates of nonradiative recombination. Here, a simple and scalable approach is demonstrated to activate long&#8208;lived phosphorescence in a wide variety of molecules by suspending them in rigid polymer hosts and annealing them above the polymer's glass transition temperature. This process produces submicron aggregates of the chromophore, which suppresses intramolecular motion that leads to nonradiative recombination and minimizes triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation that quenches phosphorescence in larger aggregates. In some cases, evidence of excimer&#8208;mediated intersystem crossing that enhances triplet generation in aggregated chromophores is found. In short, this approach circumvents the current design rules for long&#8208;lived phosphors, which will streamline their discovery and development.

         <title>Optically Mediated Nonvolatile Resistive Memory Device Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a light&#8208;mediated resistive memory device based on a highly oriented porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks film, in which the resistance state of the memristor is modulated by light, realizing the integration of the perception and storage of optical information. The memristor shows excellent performance with a wide light range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm and a persistent photoconductivity phenomenon up to 8.3 &#215; 103 s.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), characterized by tunable porosity, high surface area, and diverse chemical compositions, offer unique prospects for applications in optoelectronic devices. However, the prevailing research on thin&#8208;film devices utilizing MOFs has predominantly focused on aspects such as information storage and photosensitivity, often neglecting the integration of the advantages inherent in both photonics and electronics to enhance optical memory. This work demonstrates a light&#8208;mediated resistive memory device based on a highly oriented porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs film, in which the resistance state of the memristor is modulated by light, realizing the integration of the perception and storage of optical information. The memristor shows excellent performance with a wide light range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm and a persistent photoconductivity phenomenon up to 8.3 &#215; 103 s. Further mechanistic studies have revealed that the resistive switching effect in the memristor is primarily associated with the reversible formation and annihilation of Ag conductive filaments.

         <title>Consistent Thermal Conductivities of Spring&#8208;Like Structured Polydimethylsiloxane Composites under Large Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spring&#8208;like thermal conduction pathways of AgNW effectively improve the thermal conductivity of PDMS composites and endow them with consistent thermal conduction performance during deformation.








Abstract
Flexible and highly thermally conductive materials with consistent thermal conductivity (&#955;) during large deformation are urgently required to address the heat accumulation in flexible electronics. In this study, spring&#8208;like thermal conduction pathways of silver nanowire (S&#8208;AgNW) fabricated by 3D printing are compounded with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to prepare S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites with excellent and consistent &#955; during deformation. The S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites exhibit a &#955; of 7.63&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at an AgNW amount of 20 vol%, which is &#8776;42 times that of PDMS (0.18&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and higher than that of AgNW/PDMS composites with the same amount and random dispersion of AgNW (R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS) (5.37&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1). Variations in the &#955; of 20 vol% S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites are less than 2% under a deformation of 200% elongation, 50% compression, or 180&#176; bending, which benefits from the large deformation characteristics of S&#8208;AgNW. The heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (0.29&#160;W cm&#8722;2 K&#8722;1) of 20 vol% S&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites is &#8776;1.3 times that of the 20 vol% R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites, which reduces the temperature of a full&#8208;stressed central processing unit by 6.8&#160;&#176;C compared to that using the 20 vol% R&#8208;AgNW/PDMS composites as a thermally conductive material in the central processing unit.

         <title>Protein Interfacial Gelation toward Shuttle&#8208;Free and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk protein is introduced as electrolyte additive to trigger the interfacial gelation at both cathode and anode interface, which functions to suppress the shuttle effect and improve the Zn reversibility concurrently. Therefore, a 500 mAh zinc&#8211;iodine pouch cell with high&#8208;loading cathode (37.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and limited Zn supplementation (20% utilization) delivers excellent lifespan for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries hold potential for large&#8208;scale energy storage but struggle with shuttle effects of I2 cathodes and poor reversibility of Zn anodes. Here, an interfacial gelation strategy is proposed to suppress the shuttle effects and improve the Zn reversibility simultaneously by introducing silk protein (SP) additive. The SP can migrate bidirectionally toward cathode and anode interfaces driven by the periodically switched electric field direction during charging/discharging. For I2 cathodes, the interaction between SP and polyiodides forms gelatinous precipitate to avoid the polyiodide dissolution, evidenced by excellent electrochemical performance, including high specific capacity and Coulombic efficiency (CE) (215 mAh g&#8722;1 and 99.5% at 1 C), excellent rate performance (&#8776;170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C), and extended durability (6000 cycles at 10 C). For Zn anodes, gelatinous SP serves as protective layer to boost the Zn reversibility (99.7% average CE at 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and suppress dendrites. Consequently, a 500 mAh Zn&#8211;I2 pouch cell with high&#8208;loading cathode (37.5 mgiodine cm&#8722;2) and high&#8208;utilization Zn anode (20%) achieves remarkable energy density (80&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and long&#8208;term durability (&gt;1000 cycles). These findings underscore the simultaneous modulation of both cathode and anode and demonstrate the potential for practical applications of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Biodegradable Ferroelectric Molecular Plastic Crystal HOCH2(CF2)7CH2OH Structurally Inspired by Polyvinylidene Fluoride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular ferroelectric crystal PFND with a 2D hydrogen bond network structure is discovered following the construction idea of ferroelectric PVDF. By decreasing the number of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups from &#8776;5&#160;000 in PVDF to seven in PFND, this ferroelectric compound only needs simple solution processing and has exceptional in vitro biocompatibility, along with remarkable in vivo biodegradation and biosafety.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials, traditionally comprising inorganic ceramics and polymers, are commonly used in medical implantable devices. However, their nondegradable nature often necessitates secondary surgeries for removal. In contrast, ferroelectric molecular crystals have the advantages of easy solution processing, lightweight, and good biocompatibility, which are promising candidates for transient (short&#8208;term) implantable devices. Despite these benefits, the discovered biodegradable ferroelectric materials remain limited due to the absence of efficient design strategies. Here, inspired by the polar structure of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a ferroelectric molecular crystal 1H,1H,9H,9H&#8208;perfluoro&#8208;1,9&#8208;nonanediol (PFND), which undergoes a cubic&#8208;to&#8208;monoclinic ferroelectric plastic phase transition at 339 K, is discovered. This transition is facilitated by a 2D hydrogen bond network formed through O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions among the oriented PFND molecules, which is crucial for the manifestation of ferroelectric properties. In this sense, by reducing the number of &#8722;CF2&#8722; groups from &#8776;5&#160;000 in PVDF to seven in PFND, it is demonstrated that this ferroelectric compound only needs simple solution processing while maintaining excellent biosafety, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This work illuminates the path toward the development of new biodegradable ferroelectric molecular crystals, offering promising avenues for biomedical applications.

A H2S&#8208;evolving alternately&#8208;catalytic bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (AC&#8208;BioHJzyme) is proposed, which is consisted of CuFe2S3 and lactate oxidase (LOD) named as CuFe2S3@LOD with circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibacterial (EMA) activity and macrophage re&#8208;rousing capability. The system exhibits favorable POD&#8208;/GPx&#8208;/CAT&#8208;mimetic activities against bacteria, which can be further activated by NIR&#8208;II light. Moreover, the AC&#8208;BioHJzyme remarkably facilitate the infectious cutaneous regeneration by boosting collagen deposition, angiogenesis, and reprogramming macrophages.








Abstract
The disorder of the macrophage phenotype and the hostile by&#8208;product of lactate evoked by pathogenic infection in hypoxic deep wound inevitably lead to the stagnant skin regeneration. In this study, hydrogen sulfide (H2S)&#8208;evolving alternately catalytic bio&#8208;heterojunction enzyme (AC&#8208;BioHJzyme) consisting of CuFe2S3 and lactate oxidase (LOD) named as CuFe2S3@LOD is developed. AC&#8208;BioHJzyme exhibits circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibacterial (EMA) activity and macrophage re&#8208;rousing capability, which can be activated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) light. In this system, LOD exhausts lactate derived from bacterial anaerobic respiration and generated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which provides an abundant stock for the peroxidase&#8208;mimetic activity to convert the produced H2O2 into germicidal &#8226;OH. The GPx&#8208;mimetic activity endows AC&#8208;BioHJzyme with a glutathione consumption property to block the antioxidant systems in bacterial metabolism, while the O2 provided by the CAT&#8208;mimetic activity can generate 1O2 under the NIR&#8208;II irradiation. Synchronously, the H2S gas liberated from CuFe2S3@LOD under the infectious micromilieu allows the reduction of Fe(III)/Cu(II) to Fe(II)/Cu(&#1030;), resulting in sustained circular EMA activity. In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that the CuFe2S3@LOD AC&#8208;BioHJzyme significantly facilitates the infectious cutaneous regeneration by killing bacteria, facilitating epithelialization/collagen deposition, promoting angiogenesis, and reprogramming macrophages. This study provides a countermeasure for deep infectious wound healing via circular enzyme&#8208;mimetic antibiosis and macrophage re&#8208;rousing.

In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that the CuFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;@LOD AC-BioHJzyme significantly facilitates the infectious cutaneous regeneration by killing bacteria, facilitating epithelialization/collagen deposition, promoting angiogenesis, and reprogramming macrophages. This study provides a countermeasure for deep infectious wound healing via circular enzyme-mimetic antibiosis and macrophage re-rousing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Polymorphic Localized Heterostructure Design for High&#8208;Performance Amorphous/Nanocrystalline Composite Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymorphic localized heterostructure (including nanocrystalline region with long&#8208;range order, Si&#8208;rich transition region, and amorphous region with locally ultra&#8208;short&#8208;range ordered structure) design is proposed to optimize the polarization behavior and breakdown strength in amorphous perovskite&#8208;based dielectrics for high&#8208;performance energy storage capacitor.








Abstract
Analogous to linear dielectric, amorphous perovskite dielectrics characterized of high breakdown strength and low remanent polarization possess in&#8208;depth application in the sea, land, and air fields. Amorphous engineering is a common approach to balance the inverse relationship between polarization and breakdown strength in dielectric ceramic capacitor, however, the low polarization is the major barrier limiting the improvement of energy storage density. To address this concern, the polymorphic localized heterostructure confirmed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscope (HR&#8208;TEM) and HADDF images is constructed in BaTiO3&#8208;Bi(Ni0.5Zr0.5)O3 amorphous/nanocrystalline composite film with SiO2 addition (BT&#8208;BNZ&#8208;xS, x = 3, 5, 7, 10 mol%). The stability of nanocrystalline region achieved by Si&#8208;rich transition region and the enhancive ultra&#8208;short&#8208;range ordering in the amorphous region synergistically result in large breakdown strength and nonhysteretic polarized response. This polymorphic localized heterostructure optimizes the thermal stability in a wide temperature range and contributes ultrahigh energy storage density of 149.9 J cm&#8722;3 with markedly enhanced efficiency of 79.0%. This study provides a universal strategy to design the polarization behavior in other amorphous perovskite&#8208;based dielectrics.

         <title>Surface Gradient Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode for Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ni&#8208;rich cathode with a surface gradient is synthesized via a low&#8208;cost and scalable ammoniacal leaching method based on coordination dissolution and redox reactions. This cathode allows a full cell to exhibit impressive capacity retention and fast charging capability. Moreover, a 1.2&#160;Ah pouch cell that lasts over 500 cycles with only an 8% capacity loss is successfully demonstrated.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;rich layered oxide cathode material LiNixCoyMnzO2 (NCM) has emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). These cathode materials possess high theoretical specific capacity, fast electron/ion transfer rate, and high output voltage. However, their potential is impeded by interface instability, irreversible phase transition, and the resultant significant capacity loss, limiting their practical application in LIBs. In this work, a simple and scalable approach is proposed to prepare gradient cathode material (M&#8208;NCM) with excellent structural stability and rate performance. Taking advantage of the strong coordination of Ni2+ with ammonia and the reduction reaction of KMnO4, the elemental compositions of the Ni&#8208;rich cathode are reasonably adjusted. The resulted gradient compositional design plays a crucial role in stabilizing the crystal structure, which effectively mitigates Li/Ni mixing and suppresses unwanted surficial parasitic reactions. As a result, the M&#8208;NCM cathode maintains 98.6% capacity after 200 cycles, and a rapid charging ability of 107.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 C. Furthermore, a 1.2 Ah pouch cell configurated with graphite anode demonstrates a lifespan of over 500 cycles with only 8% capacity loss. This work provides a simple and scalable approach for the in situ construction of gradient cathode materials via cooperative coordination and deposition reactions.

         <title>Ductile P&#8208;Type AgCu(Se,S,Te) Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via systematically investigating the phase composition, crystal structure, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of about 60 AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, the comprehensive composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property phase diagrams of the AgCuSe&#8208;AgCuS&#8208;AgCuTe pseudoternary system is constructed. By mapping the complex phases, the &#8220;ductile&#8208;brittle&#8221; and &#8220;n&#8208;p&#8221; transition boundaries are determined and the composition ranges with high thermoelectric performance and inherent ductility are illustrated.








Abstract
Ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) materials open a new approach to develop high&#8208;performance flexible TE devices. N&#8208;type Ag2(S,Se,Te) and p&#8208;type AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions are two typical categories of ductile inorganic TE materials reported so far. Comparing with the Ag2(S,Se,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, the phase composition, crystal structure, and physical properties of AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions are more complex, but their relationships are still ambiguous now. In this work, via systematically investigating the phase composition, crystal structure, mechanical, and TE properties of about 60 AgCu(Se,S,Te) pseudoternary solid solutions, the comprehensive composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property phase diagrams of the AgCuSe&#8208;AgCuS&#8208;AgCuTe pseudoternary system is constructed.

On this basis, high performance p&#8208;type ductile TE materials are obtained, with a maximum zT of 0.81 at 340 K. Finally, flexible in&#8208;plane TE devices are prepared by using the AgCu(Se,S,Te)&#8208;based ductile TE materials, showing high output performance that is superior to those of organic and inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid flexible devices.

         <title>Organic Cations Texture Zinc Metal Anodes for Deep Cycling Aqueous Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The imidazolium&#8208;based cations featuring oriented adsorption on the Zn&#8208;(002) plane enable the non&#8208;epitaxial electrodeposition fabrication of (002)&#8208;textured Zn metal electrodes. Moreover, the exemplified 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Bmim+) as an electrolyte additive for working Zn batteries can well sustain the (002) texture of the as&#8208;prepared (002)&#8208;Zn electrode even under deep cycling conditions.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystallographic orientation of zinc (Zn) metal to expose more (002) planes is promising to stabilize Zn anodes in aqueous electrolytes. However, there remain challenges involving the non&#8208;epitaxial electrodeposition of highly (002) textured Zn metal and the maintenance of (002) texture under deep cycling conditions. Herein, a novel organic imidazolium cations&#8208;assisted non&#8208;epitaxial electrodeposition strategy to texture electrodeposited Zn metals is developed. Taking the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium cation (Bmim+) as a paradigm additive, the as&#8208;prepared Zn film ((002)&#8208;Zn) manifests a compact structure and a highly (002) texture without containing (100) signal. Mechanistic studies reveal that Bmim+ featuring oriented adsorption on the Zn&#8208;(002) plane can reduce the growth rate of (002) plane to render the final exposure of (002) texture, and homogenize Zn nucleation and suppress H2 evolution to enable the compact electrodeposition. In addition, the formulated Bmim+&#8208;containing ZnSO4 electrolyte effectively sustains the (002) texture even under deep cycling conditions. Consequently, the combination of (002) texture and Bmim+&#8208;containing electrolyte endows the (002)&#8208;Zn electrode with superior cycling stability over 350&#160;h under 20 mAh cm&#8722;2 with 72.6% depth&#8208;of&#8208;discharge, and assures the stable operation of full Zn batteries with both coin&#8208;type and pouch&#8208;type configurations, significantly outperforming the (002)&#8208;Zn and commercial Zn&#8208;based batteries in Bmim+&#8208;free electrolytes.

         <title>New Engineering Science Insights into the Electrode Materials Pairing of Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports how combining experiments and machine learning provides a new, practical approach to pairing the two electrodes in an electrochemical energy storage device for optimal cell&#8208;level performance under various operating conditions. This approach and the new engineering science insights in this work are vital for translating breakthrough energy materials into optimal cell&#8208;level performance for practical applications.








Abstract
Pairing the positive and negative electrodes with their individual dynamic characteristics at a realistic cell level is essential to the practical optimal design of electrochemical energy storage devices. However, the complex relationship between the performance data measured for individual electrodes and the two&#8208;electrode cells used in practice often makes an optimal pairing experimentally challenging. Taking advantage of the developed tunable graphene&#8208;based electrodes with controllable structure, experiments with machine learning are successfully united to generate a large pool of capacitance data for graphene&#8208;based electrode materials with varied slit pore sizes, thicknesses, and charging rates and numerically pair them into different combinations for two&#8208;electrode cells. The results show that the optimal pairing parameters of positive and negative electrodes vary considerably with the operation rate of the cells and are even influenced by the thickness of inactive components. The best&#8208;performing individual electrode does not necessarily result in optimal cell&#8208;level performance. The machine learning&#8208;assisted pairing approach presents much higher efficiency compared with the traditional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error approach for the optimal design of supercapacitors. The new engineering science insights observed in this work enable the adoption of artificial intelligence techniques to efficiently translate well&#8208;developed high&#8208;performance individual electrode materials into real energy storage devices.

         <title>Unlocking Efficient Hydrogen Production: Nucleophilic Oxidation Reactions Coupled with Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleophilic oxidation (NOR) has great potential as an alternative to OER. NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high&#8208;value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding valuable by&#8208;products or degrading pollutants. Focusing on the reaction mechanisms and reaction paths of different NORs in anodic oxidation reactions. The review is intended to provide theoretical guidance for future research on NOR&#8208;coupled HER hydrogen production.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting driven by sustainable energy is a clean and promising water&#8208;chemical fuel conversion technology for the production of high&#8208;purity green hydrogen. However, the sluggish kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) pose challenges for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production, limiting its efficiency and safety. Recently, the anodic OER has been replaced by a nucleophilic oxidation reaction (NOR) with biomass as the substrate and coupled with a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which has attracted great interest. Anode NOR offers faster kinetics, generates high&#8208;value products, and reduces energy consumption. By coupling NOR with hydrogen evolution reaction, hydrogen production efficiency can be enhanced while yielding high&#8208;value oxidation products or degrading pollutants. Therefore, NOR&#8208;coupled HER hydrogen production is another new green electrolytic hydrogen production strategy after electrolytic water hydrogen production, which is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy development and global decarbonization. This review explores the potential of nucleophilic oxidation reactions as an alternative to OER and delves into NOR mechanisms, guiding future research in NOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production. It assesses different NOR&#8208;coupled production methods, analyzing reaction pathways and catalyst effects. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of electrolyzers in industrialized NOR&#8208;coupled hydrogen production and discusses future prospects and challenges. This comprehensive review aims to advance efficient and economical large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Incorporation of Precipitants into High&#8208;Strength Bulk Aluminum Alloys Enables Life&#8208;Long Extraordinary Corrosion Resistance in Diverse Aqueous Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired incorporation of precipitants into high&#8208;strength bulk aluminum alloys using the inner cavity of opened carbon nanotubes enables extraordinary corrosion resistance in diverse aqueous environments. Such superior corrosion resistance is life&#8208;long and self&#8208;healing due to the on&#8208;demand minimal self&#8208;supply of precipitants dispersed throughout bulk metals. This strategy could be readily expanded to develop other corrosion&#8208;resistant high&#8208;strength metallic materials.








Abstract
The safe service and wide applications of lightweight high&#8208;strength aluminum alloys are seriously challenged by diverse environmental corrosion, since high strength and corrosion resistance are mutually exclusive for metals while surface protection cannot provide life&#8208;long corrosion resistance. Here, inspired by fish secreting slime from glands to resist external changes, a strategy of incorporating precipitants as the slime into bulk metals using the inner cavity of opened carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the glands is developed to enable high&#8208;strength aluminum alloys with life&#8208;long superior corrosion resistance. The resulting material has ultrahigh tensile strength (&#8776;700&#160;MPa) and extraordinary corrosion resistance in acidic, neutral and alkaline media. Notably, it has the highest resistance to intergranular corrosion, exfoliation corrosion and stress&#8208;corrosion cracking, compared with all previously reported aluminum alloys, and its corrosion rate is even much lower than that of corrosion&#8208;resistant pure aluminum, which results from the pronounced surface enrichment of precipitants released (secreted) from exposed CNTs forming a protective surface film. Such high corrosion resistance is life&#8208;long and self&#8208;healing due to the on&#8208;demand minimal self&#8208;supply of the precipitants dispersed throughout the bulk material. This strategy can be readily expanded to other aluminum alloys, and could pave the way for developing corrosion&#8208;resistant high&#8208;strength metallic materials.

         <title>Ceria&#8208;Optimized Oxygen&#8208;Species Exchange in Hierarchical Bimetallic Hydroxide for Electrocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By virtue of the oxophilicity and electrochemical stability of ceria, this work designs a high&#8208;performance hierarchical ceria&#8208;based electrocatalyst for water oxidation, effectively breaking the tradeoff between activity and stability. The investigation into the activity origin&#160;reveals that the oxyphilic interface brought by ceria promotes both the phase transition from hydroxide to oxyhydroxide and the adsorption of OH&#8722; ions.








Abstract
The utilization of rare earth elements to regulate the interaction between catalysts and oxygen&#8208;containing species holds promising prospects in the field of oxygen electrocatalysis. Through structural engineering and adsorption regulation, it is possible to achieve high&#8208;performance catalytic sites with a broken activity&#8208;stability tradeoff. Herein, this work fabricates a hierarchical CeO2/NiCo hydroxide for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This material exhibits superior overpotentials and enhanced stability. Multiple potential&#8208;dependent experiments reveal that CeO2 promotes oxygen&#8208;species exchange, especially OH&#8722; ions, between catalyst and environment, thereby optimizing the redox transformation of hydroxide and the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates during OER. This is attributed to the reduction in the adsorption energy barrier of Ni to *OH facilitated by CeO2, particularly the near&#8208;interfacial Ni sites. The less&#8208;damaging adsorbate evolution mechanism and the CeO2 hierarchical shell significantly enhance the structural robustness, leading to exceptional stability. Additionally, the observed &#8220;self&#8208;healing&#8221; phenomenon provides further substantiation for the accelerated oxygen exchange. This work provides a neat strategy for the synthesis of ceria&#8208;based complex hollow electrocatalysts, as well as an in&#8208;depth insight into the co&#8208;catalytic role of CeO2 in terms of oxygen transfer.

         <title>Interplay of Cooper Pairs and Zero&#8208;Energy Quasiparticles in a Gapless Superconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a gapless superconductor, abundant zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles Anderson&#8208;localize and bifurcate into regions of high and low zero&#8208;energy quasiparticle density of states.&#160;The enriched zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles&#160;interact with the Cooper pairs condensed at the Fermi level and&#160;induce puddled superconductivity and Josephson vortices even at low disorder.








Abstract
The interplay between Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov&#8208;de Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles is a topic of considerable interest in the quantum properties of solids, but its important ingredient, the sufficient amount of low&#8208;energy quasiparticles to interact with Cooper pairs remains elusive in conventional superconductors. Here a gapless superconductor with coupled paramagnetic atomic layers is used to generate a significant amount of zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles that Anderson&#8208;localize and bifurcate into regions of high and low zero&#8208;energy quasiparticle density of states. The enriched zero&#8208;energy quasiparticles induce puddled superconductivity and Josephson vortices. This discovery not only advances the understanding of the mutual interaction of Cooper pairs and BdG quasiparticles but also opens a new avenue for exploring and controlling exotic quantum phenomena where superconductivity, disorder, and spin degrees of freedom are entangled.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Strategy: Novel Borohydride&#8208;Based Solid Electrolytes Extracted from Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by peach tree secreting gum to prevent further damages, which is like generation of cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI) to prevent side reaction, a strategy to obtain solid electrolyte from CEI is proposed. Born from the borohydride, the Li&#8208;B&#8208;H&#8208;Se solid electrolyte inherits the intrinsic advantages and also exhibits improved ion conductivity, air stability and cathode compatibility due to the self&#8208;regulation effect.








Abstract
As the core component of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, current solid&#8208;state electrolytes fail to simultaneously meet multiple demands, such as their own high performance, the chemical, electrochemical and mechanical compatibility of electrode interface. A fresh perspective is rather desired to guide the development of novel solid electrolytes with comprehensive performance. Herein, this work proposes a novel strategy to synthesize solid electrolytes extracted from cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (CEI), which is inspired by peach trees secreting peach gum to prevent further damage. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, using LiBH4&#8208;Se and LiBH4&#8208;S as prototypes, confirms that as&#8208;synthesized electrolytes inherited and improved up the advantages of LiBH4 with unexpected compatibility toward multiple cathodes. It is believed that the family of new electrolytes will be continuously expanded under the guidance of this CEI&#8208;derived concept.

         <title>Bionic Artificial Skin Based on Self&#8208;Healable Ionogel Composites with Tailored Mechanics and Robust Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionogel composite with skin&#8208;like mechanical anisotropy, nonlinear mechanical response, crack growth resistance, self&#8208;healing ability, as well as high sensitivity is prepared. Direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing 3D printing technology is utilized to construct the rigid skeleton with specific structure, and the ionogel resin is then infiltrated into the skeleton, resulting in the ionogel composite through co&#8208;curing of the skeleton and the matrix resin.








Abstract
Bionic artificial skin which imitates the features and functions of human skin, has broad applications in wearable human&#8208;machine interfaces. However, equipping artificial materials with skin&#8208;like mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and high sensitivity remains challenging. Here, inspired by the structure of human skin, an artificial skin based on ionogel composites with tailored mechanical properties and robust interface is prepared. Combining finite element analysis and direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing technology, an ionogel composite with a rigid skeleton and an ionogel matrix is precisely designed and fabricated, realizing the mechanical anisotropy and nonlinear mechanical response that accurately mimic human skin. Robust interface is created through co&#8208;curing of the skeleton and matrix resins, significantly enhancing the stability of the composite. The realization of self&#8208;healing ability and resistance to crack growth further ensure the remarkable durability of the artificial skin for sensing application. In summary, the bionic artificial skin mimics the characteristics of human skin, including mechanical anisotropy, nonlinear mechanical response, self&#8208;healing capability, durability and high sensitivity when applied as flexible sensors. These strategies provide strong support for the fabrication of tissue&#8208;like materials with adaptive mechanical behaviors.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Tactile Fusion and Logic for Accurate Intention Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A location and pressure intelligent tactile sensor with an innovative layered structure is developed to realize efficient ultrahigh resolution intention interaction through in&#8208;sensor sensing, computing, and logic. It achieves outstanding resolution in location (&lt;400 &#181;m) and pressure (75 Pa) with minimal data dimension. Various touch&#8208;intention interactions are explored in logic, encryption, and interaction intelligence.








Abstract
Touch control intention recognition is an important direction for the future development of human&#8211;machine interactions (HMIs). However, the implementation of parallel&#8208;sensing functional modules generally requires a combination of different logical blocks and control circuits, which results in regional redundancy, redundant data, and low efficiency. Here, a location&#8208;and&#8208;pressure intelligent tactile sensor (LPI tactile sensor) unprecedentedly combined with sensing, computing, and logic is proposed, enabling efficient and ultrahigh&#8208;resolution action&#8211;intention interaction. The LPI tactile sensor eliminates the need for data transfer among the functional units through the core integration design of the layered structure. It actuates in&#8208;sensor perception through feature transmission, fusion, and differentiation, thereby revolutionizing the traditional von Neumann architecture. While greatly simplifying the data dimensionality, the LPI tactile sensor achieves outstanding resolution sensing in both location (&lt;400&#160;&#181;m) and pressure (75&#160;Pa). Synchronous feature fusion and decoding support the high&#8208;fidelity recognition of action and combinatorial logic intentions. Benefiting from location and pressure synergy, the LPI tactile sensor demonstrates robust privacy as an encrypted password device and interaction intelligence through pressure enhancement. It can recognize continuous touch actions in real time, map real intentions to target events, and promote accurate and efficient intention&#8208;driven HMIs.

         <title>Topological Quantum Switching Enabled Neuroelectronic Synaptic Modulators for Brain Computer Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work illustrating a developed synaptic neuroelectronic device using Bi2Se2Te quantum topological insulator marks a significant advancement in neuromorphic technology for rehabilitating neurological disorders through brain&#8211;computer interfaced neuroprosthetics. It demonstrates controlled brain synchronization and enhanced memory functions, offering a novel approach to mitigating the effects of aging and neurological disorders.








Abstract
Aging and genetic&#8208;related disorders in the human brain lead to impairment of daily cognitive functions. Due to their neural synaptic complexity and the current limits of knowledge, reversing these disorders remains a substantial challenge for brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCI). In this work, a solution is provided to potentially override aging and neurological disorder&#8208;related cognitive function loss in the human brain through the application of the authors&#8217; quantum synaptic device. To illustrate this point, a quantum topological insulator (QTI) Bi2Se2Te&#8208;based synaptic neuroelectronic device, where the electric field&#8208;induced tunable topological surface edge states and quantum switching properties make them a premier option for establishing artificial synaptic neuromodulation approaches, is designed and developed. Leveraging these unique quantum synaptic properties, the developed synaptic device provides the capability to neuromodulate distorted neural signals, leading to the reversal of age&#8208;related disorders via BCI. With the synaptic neuroelectronic characteristics of this device, excellent efficacy in treating cognitive neural dysfunctions through modulated neuromorphic stimuli is demonstrated. As a proof of concept, real&#8208;time neuromodulation of electroencephalogram (EEG) deduced distorted event&#8208;related potentials (ERP) is demonstrated by modulation of the synaptic device array.

         <title>Photostrictive Actuators Based on Freestanding Ferroelectric Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work demonstrates the application of photostriction to wirelessly drive freestanding ferroelectric membranes as resonators/actuators. Photoexcited electrons screen the ferroelectric polarization generating an in&#8208;plane strain: the underlying mechanism behind photostriction. Consequently, ferroelectric membranes exhibit orders of magnitude larger responses than non&#8208;ferroelectric ones. The findings provide significant insight for future applications in optical micro&#8208;electromechanical systems and&#160;sensors using ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Complex oxides offer a wide range of functional properties, and recent advances in the fabrication of freestanding membranes of these oxides are adding new mechanical degrees of freedom to this already rich functional ecosystem. Here, photoactuation is demonstrated in freestanding thin film resonators of ferroelectric Barium Titanate (BaTiO3) and paraelectric Strontium Titanate (SrTiO3). The free&#8208;standing films, transferred onto perforated supports, act as nano&#8208;drums, oscillating at their natural resonance frequency when illuminated by a frequency&#8208;modulated laser. The light&#8208;induced deflections in the ferroelectric BaTiO3 membranes are two orders of magnitude larger than in the paraelectric SrTiO3 ones. Time&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray micro&#8208;diffraction under illumination and temperature&#8208;dependent holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO3 originating from a partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo&#8208;excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by&#160;light.

Time-resolved X-ray micro-diffraction under illumination and temperature-dependent holographic interferometry provide combined evidence for the photostrictive strain in BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; originating from a partial screening of ferroelectric polarization by photo-excited carriers, which decreases the tetragonality of the unit cell. These findings showcase the potential of photostrictive freestanding ferroelectric films as wireless actuators operated by&#160;light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Simple Sol&#8208;Gel Protein Stabilization toward Rainbow and White Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new synthetic method for the production of silica&#8208;encapsulated protein nanomaterials without the use of organic solvents or surfactants is reported. The new pathway simplifies the procedure, allowing for less stable proteins to be used. Single&#8208;layer coatings based on several fluorescent proteins for white/rainbow lighting applications are fabricated, with improved efficiencies and stabilities.








Abstract
Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are heralded as a paradigm of sustainable materials for photonics/optoelectronics. However, their stabilization under non&#8208;physiological environments and/or harsh operation conditions is the major challenge. Among the FP&#8208;stabilization methods, classical sol&#8208;gel is the most effective, but less versatile, as most of the proteins/enzymes are easily degraded due to the need of multi&#8208;step processes, surfactants, and mixed water/organic solvents in extreme pH. Herein, sol&#8208;gel chemistry with archetypal FPs (mGreenLantern; mCherry) is revisited, simplifying the method by one&#8208;pot, surfactant&#8208;free, and aqueous media (phosphate buffer saline pH&#160;=&#160;7.4). The synthesis mechanism involves the direct reaction of the carboxylic groups at the FP surface with the silica precursor, generating a positively charged FP intermediate that acts as a seed for the formation of size&#8208;controlled mesoporous FP@SiO2 nanoparticles. Green&#8208;/red&#8208;emissive (single&#8208;FP component) and dual&#8208;emissive (multi&#8208;FPs component; kinetic studies not required) FP@SiO2 are prepared without affecting the FP photoluminescence and stabilities (&gt;6&#160;months) under dry storage and organic solvent suspensions. Finally, FP@SiO2 color filters are applied to rainbow and white bio&#8208;hybrid light&#8208;emitting diodes featuring up to 15&#8208;fold enhanced stabilities without reducing luminous efficacy compared to references with native FPs. Overall, an easy, versatile, and effective FP&#8208;stabilization method is demonstrated in FP@SiO2 toward sustainable protein lighting.

         <title>Glycocalyx&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles with Differential Organ Selectivity for Drug Delivery and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) is constructed as a platform enabling identification of organ&#8208;targeting drug delivery by systematic in vivo screening. The identified GlyNP hits show preferential accumulation in the target organ as well as cellular tropism within the target organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviate symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.








Abstract
Organ&#8208;selective drug delivery is expected to maximize the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities while minimizing their systemic toxicity. Lipid nanoparticles and polymersomes can direct the organ&#8208;selective delivery of mRNAs or gene editing machineries, but their delivery is limited to mostly liver, spleen, and lung. A platform that enables delivery to these and other target organs is urgently needed. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs) comprising five randomly combined sugar moieties is generated, and direct in vivo library screening is used to identify GlyNPs with preferential biodistribution in liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain. Each organ&#8208;targeting GlyNP hit show cellular tropism within the organ. Liver, kidney, and spleen&#8208;targeting GlyNP hits equipped with therapeutics effectively can alleviate the symptoms of acetaminophen&#8208;induced liver injury, cisplatin&#8208;induced kidney injury, and immune thrombocytopenia in mice, respectively. Furthermore, the differential organ targeting of GlyNP hits is influenced not by the protein corona but by the sugar moieties displayed on their surface. It is envisioned that the GlyNP&#8208;based platform may enable the organ&#8208; and cell&#8208;targeted delivery of therapeutic cargoes.

         <title>In&#8208;Synthesis Se&#8208;Stabilization Enables Defect and Doping Engineering of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy is developed for HgTe colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), enabling enhanced colloidal stability, doping tuning and improved passivation. This translated into greatly improved device performance and stability.








Abstract
Colloidal Quantum Dots (CQDs) of mercury telluride (HgTe) hold particular appeal for infrared photodetection due to their widely tunable infrared absorption and good compatibility with silicon electronics. While advances in surface chemistry have led to improved CQD solids, the chemical stability of HgTe material is not fully emphasized. In this study, it is aimed to address this issue and identifies a Se&#8208;stabilization strategy based on the surface coating of Se on HgTe CQDs via engineering in the precursor reactivity. The presence of Se&#8208;coating enables HgTe CQDs with improved colloidal stability, passivation, and enhanced degree of freedom in doping tuning. This enables the construction of optimized p&#8208;i&#8208;n HgTe CQD infrared photodetectors with an ultra&#8208;low dark current 3.26 &#215; 10&#8722;6 A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V and room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 5.17 &#215; 1011 Jones at wavelength &#8776;2 um, approximately one order of magnitude improvement compared to that of the control device. The stabilizing effect of Se is well preserved in the thin film state, contributing to much improved device stability. The in&#8208;synthesis Se&#8208;stabilization strategy highlights the importance of the chemical stability of materials for the construction of semiconductor&#8208;grade CQD solids and may have important implications for other high&#8208;performance CQD optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Room Temperature Polariton Condensation from Whispering Gallery Modes in CsPbBr3 Microplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The room temperature polariton condensate presents unprecedented prospects for the development of novel photonics devices. Using perovskite materials offers distinct advantages including ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. Synthesizing CsPbBr3 microplatelets using low&#8208;cost capillary bridge methods enables not only the formation of whispering gallery modes, but also the onset of polariton condensation at low thresholds.








Abstract
Room temperature (RT) polariton condensate holds exceptional promise for revolutionizing various fields of science and technology, encompassing optoelectronics devices to quantum information processing. Using perovskite materials, like all&#8208;inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) single crystal, provides additional advantages, such as ease of synthesis, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and compatibility with existing semiconductor technologies. In this work, the formation of whispering gallery modes (WGM) in CsPbBr3 single crystals with controlled geometry is shown, synthesized using a low&#8208;cost and efficient capillary bridge method. Through the implementation of microplatelets geometry, enhanced optical properties and performance are achieved due to the presence of sharp edges and a uniform surface, effectively avoiding non&#8208;radiative scattering losses caused by defects. This allows not only to observe strong light matter coupling and formation of whispering gallery polaritons, but also to demonstrate the onset of polariton condensation at RT. This investigation not only contributes to the advancement of the knowledge concerning the exceptional optical properties of perovskite&#8208;based polariton systems, but also unveils prospects for the exploration of WGM polariton condensation within the framework of a 3D perovskite&#8208;based platform, working at RT. The unique characteristics of polariton condensate, including low excitation thresholds and ultrafast dynamics, open up unique opportunities for advancements in photonics and optoelectronics&#160;devices.

         <title>Robust Chemiresistive Behavior in Conductive Polymer/MOF Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Described in this study is a hybridization strategy combining conductive metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymers for improved gas sensing. Significant enhancements in sensor recovery kinetics, cycling stability, and dynamic range at room temperature are demonstrated. Mechanistic insights into energy band alignments and sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions reported here are promising toward future high&#8208;performance chemiresistors as well as novel electronic devices based on polymer/MOF composites.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for gas sensing but are often limited to single&#8208;use detection. A hybridization strategy is demonstrated synergistically deploying conductive MOFs (cMOFs) and conductive polymers (cPs) as two complementary mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors in high&#8208;performing stand&#8208;alone chemiresistors. This work presents significant improvement in i) sensor recovery kinetics, ii) cycling stability, and iii) dynamic range at room temperature. The effect of hybridization across well&#8208;studied cMOFs is demonstrated based on 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) and 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexaiminotriphenylene (HITP) ligands with varied metal nodes (Co, Cu, Ni). A comprehensive mechanistic study is conducted to relate energy band alignments at the heterojunctions between the MOFs and the polymer with sensing thermodynamics and binding kinetics. The findings reveal that hole enrichment of the cMOF component upon hybridization leads to selective enhancement in desorption kinetics, enabling significantly improved sensor recovery at room temperature, and thus long&#8208;term response retention. This mechanism is further supported by density functional theory calculations on sorbate&#8211;analyte interactions. It is also found that alloying cPs and cMOFs enables facile thin film co&#8208;processing and device integration, potentially unlocking the use of these hybrid conductors in diverse electronic applications.

         <title>Dismantlable Coronated Nanoparticles for Coupling the Induction and Perception of Immunogenic Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dismantlable coronated nanoparticles are fabricated as spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling immunogenic cell death (ICD) induction to immune perception. The covalently cross&#8208;linked antibody corona shell disassembles in the tumor microenvironment, enables dual ICD modulations within tumor cells and on dendritic cell surfaces, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in breast and colorectal cancers.








Abstract
Therapy&#8208;induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti&#8208;tumor efficacy. However, dying cell&#8208;released ICD signals are prone to being sequestered by the TIM&#8208;3 receptors on dendritic cell (DC) surfaces, preventing immune surveillance. Herein, dismantlable coronated nanoparticles (NPs) are fabricated as a type of spatiotemporally controlled nanocarriers for coupling tumor cell&#8208;mediated ICD induction to DC&#8208;mediated immune sensing. These NPs are loaded with an ICD inducer, mitoxantrone (MTO), and wrapped by a redox&#8208;labile anti&#8208;TIM&#8208;3 (&#945;TIM&#8208;3) antibody corona, forming a separable core&#8211;shell structure. The antibody corona disintegrates under high levels of extracellular reactive oxygen species in the tumor microenvironment, exposing the MTO&#8208;loaded NP core for ICD induction and releasing functional &#945;TIM&#8208;3 molecules for DC sensitization. Systemic administration of the coronated NPs augments DC maturation, promotes cytotoxic T cell recruitment, enhances tumor susceptibility to immune checkpoint blockade, and prevents the side effects of MTO. This study develops a promising nanoplatform to unleash the potential of host immunity in cancer therapy.

&lt;p&gt;Therapy-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) can initiate both innate and adaptive immune responses for amplified anti-tumor efficacy.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Pressure&#8208;Dependent Programmable Mechanical Metamaterial with Self&#8208;Sealing Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sealing is a fascinating function in living systems, essential for immediate response to damage. The self&#8208;sealing principle found in the plant model of Delosperma cooperi has inspired the design of mechanical metamaterial that can react autonomously to induced damage. By harnessing the internal pressure, the presented metamaterial is capable of closing cracks, facilitating favorable conditions for a potential subsequent self&#8208;healing process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sealing is one of the fascinating functions in nature that enables living material systems to respond immediately to damage. A prime plant model is Delosperma cooperi, which can rapidly self&#8208;seal damaged succulent leaves by systematically deforming until the wound closes. Inspired by this self&#8208;sealing principle, a novel programmable mechanical metamaterial has been developed to mimic the underlying damage management concept. This material is able to react autonomously to changes in its physical condition caused by an induced damage. To design this ability into the programmable metamaterial, a permeable unit cell design has been developed that can change size depending on the internal pressure. The parameter space and associated mechanical functionality of the unit cell design is simulated and analyzed under periodic boundary conditions and various pressures. The principles of self&#8208;sealing behavior in designed metamaterials are investigated, crack closure efficiency is identified for different crack lengths, the limitations of the proposed approach are discussed, and successful crack closure is experimentally demonstrated in the fabricated metamaterial. Although this study facilitates the first step on the way of integrating new bio&#8208;inspired principles in the metamaterials, the results show how programmable mechanical metamaterials might extend materials design space from pure properties to life&#8208;like&#160;abilities.

Here, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic is proposed for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. By varying the alkane ligand length and density on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles, the ligand&#8208;directed spatial regulation tailored structures, properties, and functionalities, thus championing the progressive development of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;functionalized organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanoparticles (OINPs) are an emerging category of multifunctional nanomaterials with vast potential applications. The spatial arrangement and positioning of AIEgens and inorganic compounds in AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs determine the structures, properties, and functionalities of the self&#8208;assembled nanomaterials. In this work, a facile and general emulsion self&#8208;assembly tactic for synthesizing well&#8208;defined AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs is proposed by coassembling alkane chain&#8208;functionalized inorganic nanoparticles with hydrophobic organic AIEgens. As a proof of concept, the self&#8208;assembly and structural evolution of plasmonic&#8208;fluorescent hybrid nanoparticles (PFNPs) from concentric circle to core shell and then to Janus structures is demonstrated by using alkane chain&#8208;modified AuNPs and AIEgens as building blocks. The spatial position of AuNPs in the signal nanocomposite is controlled by varying the alkane ligand length and density on the AuNP surface. The mechanism behind the formation of various PFNP nanostructures is also elucidated through experiments and theoretical simulation. The obtained PFNPs with diverse structures exhibit spatially tunable optical and photothermal properties for advanced applications in multicolor and multimode immunolabeling and photothermal sterilization. This work presents an innovative synthetic approach of constructing AIEgen&#8208;functionalized OINPs with diverse structures, compositions, and functionalities, thereby championing the progressive development of these OINPs.

         <title>Structurally Aligned Multifunctional Neural Probe (SAMP) Using Forest&#8208;Drawn CNT Sheet onto Thermally Drawn Polymer Fiber for Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP), which integrates forest&#8208;drawn CNT sheets integrated onto thermally drawn polymer fibers, is presented with an emphasis on its manufacturing novelty and in vivo capabilities: 1) Easy fabrication techniques resulting in structurally aligned fiber implants; 2) Versatile and reliable in vivo performance; 3) Robust long&#8208;term operation in vivo system.








Abstract
Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural probe engineering is a dynamic field, driving innovation in neuroscience and addressing scientific and medical demands. Recent advancements involve integrating nanomaterials to improve performance, aiming for sustained in vivo functionality. However, challenges persist due to size, stiffness, complexity, and manufacturing intricacies. To address these issues, a neural interface utilizing freestanding CNT-sheets drawn from CNT-forests integrated onto thermally drawn functional polymer fibers is proposed. This approach yields a device with structural alignment, resulting in exceptional electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties while retaining biocompatibility for prolonged periods of implantation. This Structurally Aligned Multifunctional neural Probe (SAMP) employing forest-drawn CNT sheets demonstrates in vivo capabilities in neural recording, neurotransmitter detection, and brain/spinal cord circuit manipulation via optogenetics, maintaining functionality for over a year post-implantation.

         <title>Self&#8208;Lubricating, Living Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A living hydrogel with embedded biofactories of hyaluronic acid allows the development of contact lens prototypes with permanent self&#8208;lubrication and full transparency. Lubricant release is adjusted by the mechanical and diffusional properties of the hydrogel and regulated by the availability of nutrients in simulated tear fluid.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of dry eye syndrome in aging and digital societies compromises long&#8208;term contact lens (CL) wear and forces users to regular eye drop instillation to alleviate discomfort. Here a novel approach with the potential to improve and extend the lubrication properties of CLs is presented. This is achieved by embedding lubricant&#8208;secreting biofactories within the CL material. The self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs autonomously produce and release hyaluronic acid (HA), a natural lubrication and wetting agent, long term. The hydrogel matrix regulates the growth of the biofactories and the HA production, and allows the diffusion of nutrients and HA for at least 3 weeks. The continuous release of HA sustainably reduces the friction coefficient of the CL surface. A self&#8208;lubricating CL prototype is presented, where the functional biofactories are contained in a functional ring at the lens periphery, outside of the vision area. The device is cytocompatible and fulfils physicochemical requirements of commercial CLs. The fabrication process is compatible with current manufacturing processes of CLs for vision correction. It is envisioned that the durable&#8208;by&#8208;design approach in living CL could enable long&#8208;term wear comfort for CL users and minimize the need for lubricating eye drops.

         <title>A Biohybrid Self&#8208;Dispersing Miniature Machine Using Wild Oat Fruit Awns for Reforestation and Precision Agriculture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plant&#8208;inspired, miniaturized, autonomous hybrid machine mimicking Avena fruits (called HybriBot) is proposed. It combines a biodegradable cargo capsule with two natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological actuators. HybriBot can navigate soil irregularities, achieving forces comparable to natural counterparts, and is functionalized with fertilizers and seeds, successfully germinating diaspores for applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.








Abstract
Advances in bioinspired and biohybrid robotics are enabling the creation of multifunctional systems able to explore complex unstructured environments. Inspired by Avena fruits, a biohybrid miniaturized autonomous machine (HybriBot) composed of a biomimetic biodegradable capsule as cargo delivery system and natural humidity&#8208;driven sister awns as biological motors is reported. Microcomputed tomography, molding via two&#8208;photon polymerization and casting of natural awns into biodegradable materials is employed to fabricate multiple HybriBots capable of exploring various soil and navigating soil irregularities, such as holes and cracks. These machines replicate the dispersal movements and biomechanical performances of natural fruits, achieving comparable capsule drag forces up to &#8776;0.38 N and awns torque up to &#8776;100 mN mm&#8722;1. They are functionalized with fertilizer and are successfully utilized to germinate selected diaspores. HybriBots function as self&#8208;dispersed systems with applications in reforestation and precision agriculture.

         <title>A Versatile Synthesis Platform Based on Polymer Cubosomes for a Library of Highly Ordered Nanoporous Metal Oxides Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles with different compositions and periodicity is designed and synthesized via a general and flexible polymer cubosome templating strategy. Due to their favorable porosity and rich active sites, the obtained nanoporous metal oxides, for example, tungsten oxides exhibit excellent gas sensing performances to low&#8208;concentration H2S.








Abstract
Polymer cubosomes (PCs) have well&#8208;defined inverse bicontinuous cubic mesophases formed by amphiphilic block copolymer bilayers. The open hydrophilic channels, large periods, and robust physical properties of PCs are advantageous to many host&#8211;guest interactions and yet not fully exploited, especially in the fields of functional nanomaterials. Here, the self&#8208;assembly of poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene block copolymers is systematically investigated and a series of robust PCs is developed via a cosolvent method. Ordered nanoporous metal oxide particles are obtained by selectively filling the hydrophilic channels of PCs via an impregnation strategy, followed by a two&#8208;step thermal treatment. Based on this versatile PC platform, the general synthesis of a library of ordered porous particles with different pore structures 3&#175;$\bar{3}$ 3&#175;$\bar{3}$, tunable large pore size (18&#8211;78&#160;nm), high specific surface areas (up to 123.3&#160;m2&#160;g&#8722;1 for WO3) and diverse framework compositions, such as transition and non&#8208;transition metal oxides, rare earth chloride oxides, perovskite, pyrochlore, and high&#8208;entropy metal oxides is demonstrated. As typical materials obtained via this method, ordered porous WO3 particles have the advantages of open continuous structure and semiconducting properties, thus showing superior gas sensing performances toward hydrogen sulfide.

         <title>Eliminating the Adverse Impact of Composition Modulation in Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes toward Ultra&#8208;High Brightness and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The component modulation&#8208;induced ion doping of perovskite emitters and the underlying mechanism of the nature instability are revealed for FAPbI3&#8208;based NIR PeLEDs with excess organic halides. By eliminating adverse effects of the excessively incorporated organoammonium halides using a surface clean&#8208;assisted crosslinking strategy, a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2, and an excellent half&#8208;lifetime of 106.1 h are achieved simultaneously.








Abstract
Excess ammonium halides as composition additives are widely employed in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs), aiming to achieve high performance by controlling crystallinity and passivating defects. However, an in&#8208;depth understanding of whether excess organoammonium components affect the film physical/electrical properties and the resultant device instability is still lacking. Here, the trade&#8208;off between the performance and stability in high&#8208;efficiency formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3)&#8208;based PeLEDs with excess ammonium halides is pointed, and the underlying mechanism is explored. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that excess halide salt&#8208;induced ion&#8208;doping largely alters the PeLEDs properties (e.g., carrier injection, field&#8208;dependent ion&#8208;drifting, defect physics, and phase stability). A surface clean assisted cross&#8208;linking strategy is demonstrated to eliminate the adverse impact of composition modulation and boost the operational stability without sacrificing the efficiency, achieving a high efficiency of 23.6%, a high radiance of 964 W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2 (The highest value for FAPbI3 based PeLEDs), and a prolong lifetime of 106.1 h at large direct current density (100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), concurrently. The findings uncovered an important link between excess halide salts and the device performance, providing a guideline for rational design of stable, bright, and high efficiency PeLEDs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Charging Aqueous Zn//COF Battery with UltraHigh Self&#8208;Charging Efficiency and Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient air self&#8208;charging Zn//COF&#8208;PTO battery is developed. COF&#8208;PTO spontaneously forms metal heterocyclic complexes with zinc ions (step 2) to promote the self&#8208;charging reaction (step 1), which is a mechanism similar to Le Chatelier's principle in chemical reactions. Therefore, Zn//COF&#8208;PTO batteries exhibit excellent self&#8208;charging efficiency (&#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (&#957;).








Abstract
Self&#8208;charging zinc batteries that combine energy harvesting technology with batteries are candidates for reliable self&#8208;charging power systems. However, the lack of rational materials design results in unsatisfactory self&#8208;charging performance. Here, a covalent organic framework containing pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone groups (COF&#8208;PTO) is reported as a cathode material for aqueous self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. The ordered channel structure of the COF&#8208;PTO provides excellent capacity retention of 98% after 18 000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1 and ultra&#8208;fast ion transfer. To visually assess the self&#8208;charging performance, two parameters, namely self&#8208;charging efficiency (self&#8208;charging discharge capacity/galvanostatic discharge capacity, &#951;) and average self&#8208;charging rate (total discharge capacity after cyclic self&#8208;charging/total cyclic self&#8208;charging time, &#957;), are proposed for performance evaluation. COF&#8208;PTO achieves an impressive &#951; of 96.9% and an &#957; of 30&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 self&#8208;charge capacity per hour in 100 self&#8208;charging cycles, surpassing the previous reports. Mechanism studies reveal the co&#8208;insertion of Zn2+ and H+ double ions in COF&#8208;PTO of self&#8208;charging zinc batteries. In addition, the C&#9552;N and C&#9552;O (on the benzene) in COF&#8208;PTO are ortho structures to each other, which can easily form metal heterocycles with Zn ions, thereby driving the forward progress of the self&#8208;charging reaction and enhancing the self&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>Entangled Mesh Hydrogels with Macroporous Topologies via Cryogelation for Rapid Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal network engineering is proposed to develop the entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs) with a distinct aerogel&#8208;like macroporous topology, exhibiting a significantly improved mass transport property compared with the conventional dense hydrogels&#160;by regular polymerization. As such, the hygroscopic EMHs deliver remarkably faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption kinetics, achieving high&#8208;performance sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) is a promising technology to alleviate freshwater scarcity. Recently, hygroscopic salt&#8208;hydrogel composites (HSHCs) have emerged as attractive candidates with their high water uptake, versatile designability, and scale&#8208;up fabrication. However, achieving high&#8208;performance SAWH applications for HSHCs has been challenging because of their sluggish kinetics, attributed to their limited mass transport properties. Herein, a universal network engineering of hydrogels using a cryogelation method is presented, significantly improving the SAWH kinetics of HSHCs. As a result of the entangled mesh confinements formed during cryogelation, a stable macroporous topology is attained and maintained within the obtained entangled&#8208;mesh hydrogels (EMHs), leading to significantly enhanced mass transport properties compared to conventional dense hydrogels (CDHs). With it, corresponding hygroscopic EMHs (HEMHs) simultaneously exhibit faster moisture sorption and solar&#8208;driven water desorption. Consequently, a rapid&#8208;cycling HEMHs&#8208;based harvester delivers a practical freshwater production of 2.85 Lwater kgsorbents&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 via continuous eight sorption/desorption cycles, outperforming other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogel&#8208;based sorbents. Significantly, the generalizability of this strategy is validated by extending it to other hydrogels used in HSHCs. Overall, this work offers a new approach to efficiently address long&#8208;standing challenges of sluggish kinetics in current HSHCs, promoting them toward the next&#8208;generation SAWH applications.

         <title>Stabilization of Lattice Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Oxophilic Ce&#8208;Mediated Bi/BiCeO1.8H Electrocatalysts for Efficient Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Bi/BiCeO1.8H containing under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms is proposed and demonstrated for lattice oxygen redox&#8208;catalyzed oxygen evolution electrocatalysts using a simple electrosynthesis. Bi/BiCeO1.8H&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V and catalytic stability for 100 h at a practically high current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) offers an efficient reaction pathway for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in energy storage and conversion systems. Owing to the involvement of active lattice oxygen enhancing electrochemical activity, addressing the structural and electrochemical stabilities of LOM materials is crucial. Herein, a heterostructure (Bi/BiCeO1.8H) containing abundant under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms having oxygen nonbonding states is synthesized by a simple electrochemical deposition method. Given the difference in reduction potentials between Bi and Ce, partially reduced Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms are generated in BiCeO1.8H. It is found that the lattice oxygen can be activated as a reactant of the OER when the valence state of Bi increases to Bi5+, leading to increased metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and that the oxophilic Ce3+/4+ redox couple can maintain the Bi nanoparticles and surrounding under&#8208;coordinated oxygen atoms by preventing over&#8208;oxidation of Bi. The anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer with Bi/BiCeO1.8H exhibits a low cell voltage of 1.79 V even at a high practical current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the cell performance remains significantly stable over 100 h with only a 2.2% increase in the initial cell voltage, demonstrating sustainable lattice oxygen redox.

         <title>A Comprehensive Strategy Based on High Clinical Translational Nanosystem for Programmable Immunotherapy of Triple Negative Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic of the multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) with high clinical translational potential preparation with sodium hyaluronate (HA), salvianolic acid B (SAB) and Fe3+, and their application in photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy are demonstrated. In particular, combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody is shown for comprehensive procedural therapy of immunologically cold tumors triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs).








Abstract
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBCs), known as an immunologically cold tumor, is difficult to completely eliminate with existing monotherapies, let alone metastasis and recurrence. It is urgent to design a rational combination of multiple therapies to programmatically reconstitute tumor microenvironment (TME) and reverse the immune &#8220;cold&#8221; into &#8220;hot&#8221; inflammatory tumors to improve the therapeutic effect. Hence, in this work, a multifunctional nanosystem (FeSH NPs) that integrates metal&#8208;polyphenol coordination complex as a photothermal agent and polyphenol, salvianolic acid B (SAB) as immunomodulator is designed and fabricated for synergistic photothermal&#8208;immunotherapy of TNBCs combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody. Guided by photothermal/photoacoustic dual&#8208;mode imaging, photothermal therapy (PTT) caused by FeSH NPs induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. Subsequently, the loaded SAB is released with the addition of deferoxamine mesylate (DFO) to remodel TME, specifically TGF&#8208;&#946; inhibition and PD&#8208;L1 upregulation, and eliminate the primary tumors. The combination of PTT and TME reprogramming by FeSH NPs further synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody to eradicate recurrence and inhibit metastasis of TNBCs concurrently. Given the biosafety of FeSH NPs throughout the lifecycle, this work provides a protocol with high clinical translational promise for comprehensive programmed therapeutics of immunologically cold tumors TNBCs.

         <title>Intrahippocampal Supramolecular Assemblies Directed Bioorthogonal Liberation of Neurotransmitters to Suppress Seizures in Freely Moving Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An imbalance between neuronal inhibition and excitation may lead to the onset of epilepsy. In this study, bioorthogonal decaging reactions and photolysis enable on&#8208;demand drug release to address the deficiency of an inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) during seizure symptoms. Such a spatiotemporal&#8208;controlled drug delivery system is applicable for managing epileptic seizures with an unprovoked nature.








Abstract
The precise delivery of anti&#8208;seizure medications (ASM) to epileptic loci remains the major challenge to treat epilepsy without causing adverse drug reactions. The unprovoked nature of epileptic seizures raises the additional need to release ASMs in a spatiotemporal controlled manner. Targeting the oxidative stress in epileptic lesions, here the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced in situ supramolecular assemblies that synergized bioorthogonal reactions to deliver inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA) on&#8208;demand, are developed. Tetrazine&#8208;bearing assembly precursors undergo oxidation and selectively self&#8208;assemble under pathological conditions inside primary neurons and mice brains. Assemblies induce local accumulation of tetrazine in the hippocampus CA3 region, which allows the subsequent bioorthogonal release of inhibitory neurotransmitters. For induced acute seizures, the sustained release of GABA extends the suppression than the direct supply of GABA. In the model of permanent damage of CA3, bioorthogonal ligation on assemblies provides a reservoir of GABA that behaves prompt release upon 365&#160;nm irradiation. Incorporated with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art microelectrode arrays, it is elucidated that the bioorthogonal release of GABA shifts the neuron spike waveforms to suppress seizures at the single&#8208;neuron precision. The strategy of in situ supramolecular assemblies&#8208;directed bioorthogonal prodrug activation shall be promising for the effective delivery of ASMs to treat epilepsy.

         <title>Observation of Omnidirectional Exchange Bias at All&#8208;Antiferromagnetic Polycrystalline Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An exchange bias effect at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is observed. The chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn works as the active layer, replacing conventional ferromagnets. The unidirectional magnetic anisotropy can be determined omnidirectionally due to the absence of the shape anisotropy. These findings are significant for developing various antiferromagnetic spintronic devices, including antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions, essential for ultrafast and ultra&#8208;power&#8208;efficient computing.








Abstract
Due to promising functionalities that may dramatically enhance spintronics performance, antiferromagnets are the subject of intensive research for developing the next&#8208;generation active elements to replace ferromagnets. In particular, the recent experimental demonstration of tunneling magnetoresistance and electrical switching using chiral antiferromagnets has sparked expectations for the practical integration of antiferromagnetic materials into device architectures. To further develop the technology to manipulate the magnetic anisotropies in all&#8208;antiferromagnetic devices, it is essential to realize exchange bias through the interface between antiferromagnetic multilayers. Here, the first observation on the omnidirectional exchange bias at an all&#8208;antiferromagnetic polycrystalline heterointerface is reported. This experiment demonstrates that the interfacial energy causing the exchange bias between the chiral&#8208;antiferromagnet Mn3Sn/collinear&#8208;antiferromagnet MnN layers is comparable to those found at the conventional ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface at room temperature. In sharp contrast with previous reports using ferromagnets, the magnetic field control of the unidirectional anisotropy is found to be omnidirectional due to the absence of the shape anisotropy in the antiferromagnetic multilayer. The realization of the omnidirectional exchange bias at the interface between polycrystalline antiferromagnets on amorphous templates, highly compatible with existing Si&#8208;based devices, paves the way for developing ultra&#8208;low power and ultra&#8208;high speed memory devices based on antiferromagnets.

         <title>Multiphase Under&#8208;Liquid Biofabrication With Living Soft Matter: A Route to Customize Functional Architectures With Microbial Nanocellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under&#8208;liquid biofabrication utilizes oxygen transport through an oil phase to sustain aerobic bacterial activity at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces. This technique combines multiphase systems with living matter to open new opportunities to advance cellulose&#8208;based architectures through soft templating, including those based on capsules, porous materials, filaments, layered film composites, and Janus membranes.








Abstract
The growth of aerobic microbes at air&#8211;water interfaces typically leads to biofilm formation. Herein, a fermentative alternative that relies on oil&#8211;water interfaces to support bacterial activity and aerotaxis is introduced. The process uses under&#8208;liquid biofabrication by structuring bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) to achieve tailorable architectures. Cellulose productivity in static conditions is first evaluated using sets of oil homologues, classified in order of polarity. The oils are shown for their ability to sustain bacterial growth and BNC production according to air transfer and solubilization, both of which impact the physiochemical properties of the produced biofilms. The latter are investigated in terms of their morphological (fibril size and network density), structural (crystallinity) and physical&#8211;mechanical (surface area and strength) features. The introduced under&#8208;liquid biofabrication is demonstrated for the generation of BNC&#8208;based macroscale architectures and compartmentalized soft matter. This can be accomplished following three different routes, namely, 3D under&#8208;liquid networking (multi&#8208;layer hydrogels/composites), emulsion templating (capsules, emulgels, porous materials), and anisotropic layering (Janus membranes). Overall, the proposed platform combines living matter and multi&#8208;phase systems as a robust option for material development with relevance in biomedicine, soft robotics, and bioremediation, among others.

         <title>Knotted Artificial Muscles for Bio&#8208;Mimetic Actuation under Deepwater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel type of artificial muscles is proposed from intricately knotted liquid crystal elastomer fibers, capable of high stroke, and fast linear contractions. These muscles remain functional even when significantly damaged or submerged at depths of 3000 meters underwater, mirroring the remarkable robustness and adaptability of their natural counterparts.








Abstract
Muscles featuring high frequency and high stroke linear actuation are essential for animals to achieve superior maneuverability, agility, and environmental adaptability. Artificial muscles are yet to match their biological counterparts, due to inferior actuation speed, magnitude, mode, or adaptability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of natural muscles, artificial muscles are created that are powerful, responsive, robust, and adaptable. The artificial muscles consist of knots braided from 3D printed liquid crystal elastomer fibers and thin heating threads. The unique hierarchical, braided knot structure offers amplified linear stroke, force rate, and damage&#8208;tolerance, as verified by both numerical simulations and experiments. In particular, the square knotted artificial muscle shows reliable cycles of actuation at 1Hz in 3000m depth underwater. Potential application is demonstrated by propelling a model boat. Looking ahead, the knotted artificial muscles can empower novel biomedical devices and soft robots to explore various environments, from inside human body to the mysterious deep&#160;sea.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Free and Hierarchical Porous Triboelectric Scaffold with Dynamic Hydrophilicity for Efficient Cartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs). During degradation, the TESs exhibit hydrophilicity on the surface for tissue regeneration while hydrophobicity in interior micropores for triboelectric therapy. TESs provide a new platform technology for tissue engineering. The device design successfully addresses the challenge of encapsulation&#8208;free triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) in vivo and will broaden their applications.








Abstract
Tissue engineering and electrotherapy are two promising methods to promote tissue repair. However, their integration remains an underexplored area, because their requirements on devices are usually distinct. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self&#8208;powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs) is proposed.

     alt="An Encapsulation-Free and Hierarchical Porous Triboelectric Scaffold with Dynamic Hydrophilicity for Efficient Cartilage Regeneration"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work proposes the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs). During degradation, the TESs exhibit hydrophilicity on the surface for tissue regeneration while hydrophobicity in interior micropores for triboelectric therapy. TESs provide a new platform technology for tissue engineering. The device design successfully addresses the challenge of encapsulation-free triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) in vivo and will broaden their applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tissue engineering and electrotherapy are two promising methods to promote tissue repair. However, their integration remains an underexplored area, because their requirements on devices are usually distinct. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have shown great potential to develop self-powered devices. However, due to their susceptibility to moisture, TENGs have to be encapsulated in vivo. Therefore, existing TENGs cannot be employed as tissue engineering scaffolds, which require direct interaction with surrounding cells. Here, the concept of triboelectric scaffolds (TESs) is proposed. Poly(glycerol sebacate), a biodegradable and relatively hydrophobic elastomer, is selected as the matrix of TESs. Each hydrophobic micropore in multi-hierarchical porous TESs efficiently serves as a moisture-resistant working unit of TENGs. Integration of tons of micropores ensures the electrotherapy ability of TESs in vivo without encapsulation. Originally hydrophobic TESs are degraded by surface erosion and transformed into hydrophilic surfaces, facilitating their role as tissue engineering scaffolds. Notably, TESs seeded with chondrocytes obtain dense and large matured cartilages after subcutaneous implantation in nude mice. Importantly, rabbits with osteochondral defects receiving TES implantation show favorable hyaline cartilage regeneration and complete cartilage healing. This work provides a promising electronic biomedical device and will inspire a series of new in vivo applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Disorder&#8208;Broadened Phase Boundary with Enhanced Amorphous Superconductivity in Pressurized In2Te5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
According to the Gibbs phase rule, the degree of freedom at conventional phase boundaries is 1 (F = 1). By introducing an intermediate amorphous phase, a rare crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline transition is achieved and the sharp phase boundary is successfully expanded into a broad region (F = 2) in which the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is significantly enhanced.








Abstract
As an empirical tool in materials science and engineering, the iconic phase diagram owes its robustness and practicality to the topological characteristics rooted in the celebrated Gibbs phase law free variables (F) = components (C) &#8211; phases (P) + 2. When crossing the phase diagram boundary, the structure transition occurs abruptly, bringing about an instantaneous change in physical properties and limited controllability on the boundaries (F = 1). Here, the sharp phase boundary is expanded to an amorphous transition region (F = 2) by partially disrupting the long&#8208;range translational symmetry, leading to a sequential crystalline&#8211;amorphous&#8211;crystalline (CAC) transition in a pressurized In2Te5 single crystal. Through detailed in situ synchrotron diffraction, it is elucidated that the phase transition stems from the rotation of immobile blocks [In2Te2]2+, linked by hinge&#8208;like [Te3]2&#8722; trimers. Remarkably, within the amorphous region, the amorphous phase demonstrates a notable 25% increase of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc), while the carrier concentration remains relatively constant. Furthermore, a theoretical framework is proposed revealing that the unconventional boost in amorphous superconductivity might be attributed to an intensified electron correlation, triggered by a disorder&#8208;augmented multifractal behavior. These findings underscore the potential of disorder and prompt further exploration of unforeseen phenomena on the phase boundaries.

         <title>Synergizing Fe2O3 Nanoparticles on Single Atom Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C for Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia at Industrial Current Densities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>

Here, the effectiveness of a novel active particle&#8208;active support Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst is demonstrated for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption elucidates a reduction in surface Fe3+ to Fe0, during a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, significantly enhancing the NO3RR activity, enabling a partial current density up to 2 A cm&#8722;2 at near 100% efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of nitrates (NO3&#8722;) enables a pathway for the carbon neutral synthesis of ammonia (NH3), via the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), which has been demonstrated at high selectivity. However, to make NH3 synthesis cost&#8208;competitive with current technologies, high NH3 partial current densities (jNH3) must be achieved to reduce the levelized cost of NH3. Here, the high NO3RR activity of Fe&#8208;based materials is leveraged to synthesize a novel active particle&#8208;active support system with Fe2O3 nanoparticles supported on atomically dispersed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C. The optimized 3&#215;Fe2O3/Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst demonstrates an ultrahigh NO3RR activity, reaching a maximum jNH3 of 1.95 A cm&#8722;2 at a Faradaic efficiency (FE) for NH3 of 100% and an NH3 yield rate over 9 mmol hr&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2. Operando XANES and post&#8208;mortem XPS reveal the importance of a pre&#8208;reduction activation step, reducing the surface Fe2O3 (Fe3+) to highly active Fe0 sites, which are maintained during electrolysis. Durability studies demonstrate the robustness of both the Fe2O3 particles and Fe&#8211;Nx sites at highly cathodic potentials, maintaining a current of &#8722;1.3 A cm&#8722;2 over 24 hours. This work exhibits an effective and durable active particle&#8208;active support system enhancing the performance of the NO3RR, enabling industrially relevant current densities and near 100% selectivity.

         <title>Universal Synthesis of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts by Direct Thermal Decomposition of Molten Salts for Boosting Acidic Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of noble metal single atoms embedded in non&#8208;noble metal oxides are simply synthesized through the direct thermal decomposition of molten salts. The resultant single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic activity and durability for both of the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions in acidic media.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are considered prominent materials in the field of catalysis due to their high metal atom utilization and selectivity. However, the wide&#8208;ranging applications of SACs remain a significant challenge due to their complex preparation processes. Here, a universal strategy is reported to prepare a series of noble metal single atoms on different non&#8208;noble metal oxides through a facile one&#8208;step thermal decomposition of molten salts. By using a mixture of non&#8208;noble metal nitrate and a small&#8208;amount noble metal chloride as the precursor, noble metal single atoms can be easily introduced into the non&#8208;noble metal oxide lattice owing to the cation exchange in the in situ formed molten salt, followed by the thermal decomposition of nitrate anions during the heating process. Analyses using aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirm the formation of the finely dispersed single atoms. Specially, the as&#8208;synthesized Ir single atoms (10.97 wt%) and Pt single atoms (4.60 wt%) on the Co3O4 support demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Highly Stiff and Tough Shape Memory Polyurea with Unprecedented Energy Density by Precise Slight Cross&#8208;Linking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>

An innovative approach utilizing a delicate balance of precise covalent bonds and hierarchical supramolecular interactions has resulted in an advanced shape memory polymer. This polymer boasts a unique combination of high stiffness, strength, and toughness, coupled with excellent resistance to humidity and heat, repairability, high energy density, and exceptional energy output, which allows for a wide range of potential applications.








Abstract
Shape memory polymers (SMPs) have attracted significant attention and hold vast potential for diverse applications. Nevertheless, conventional SMPs suffer from notable shortcomings in terms of mechanical properties, environmental stability, and energy density, significantly constraining their practical utility. Here, inspired by the structure of muscle fibers, an innovative approach that involves the precise incorporation of subtle, permanent cross&#8208;linking within a hierarchical hydrogen bonding supramolecular network is reported. This novel strategy has culminated in the development of covalent and supramolecular shape memory polyurea, which exhibits exceptional mechanical properties, including high stiffness (1347&#160;MPa), strength (82.4&#160;MPa), and toughness (312.7&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), ensuring its suitability for a wide range of applications. Furthermore, it boasts remarkable recyclability and repairability, along with excellent resistance to moisture, heat, and solvents. Moreover, the polymer demonstrates outstanding shape memory effects characterized by a high energy density (24.5&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), facilitated by the formation of strain&#8208;induced oriented nanostructures that can store substantial amounts of entropic energy. Simultaneously, it maintains a remarkable 96% shape fixity and 99% shape recovery. This delicate interplay of covalent and supramolecular bonds opens up a promising pathway to the creation of high&#8208;performance SMPs, expanding their applicability across various domains.

         <title>The Impact of Local Strain Fields in Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The properties of noncollinear antiferromagnets are highly sensitive to strain, including large local strain fields generated by dislocations. The influence of these on the global magnetization and transport properties is examined, finding that they enhance the magnetization but are deleterious to intrinsic properties important for application. This analysis is timely as efforts are made to integrate these materials into multilayer devices.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets hosting structural or magnetic order that breaks time reversal symmetry are of increasing interest for &#8220;beyond von Neumann&#8221; computing applications because the topology of their band structure allows for intrinsic physical properties, exploitable in integrated memory and logic function. One such group are the noncollinear antiferromagnets. Essential for domain manipulation is the existence of small net moments found routinely when the material is synthesized in thin film form and attributed to symmetry breaking caused by spin canting, either from the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction or from strain. Although the spin arrangement of these materials makes them highly sensitive to strain, there is little understanding about the influence of local strain fields caused by lattice defects on global properties, such as magnetization and anomalous Hall effect. This premise is investigated by examining noncollinear antiferromagnetic films that are either highly lattice mismatched or closely matched to their substrate. In either case, edge dislocation networks are generated and for the former case, these extend throughout the entire film thickness, creating large local strain fields. These strain fields allow for finite intrinsic magnetization in seemingly structurally relaxed films and influence the antiferromagnetic domain state and the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect.

         <title>Tailored Fabrication of Full&#8208;Color Ultrastable Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Carbon Dots Composites with Unexpected Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Composites of carbon dots and urea that exhibit full&#8208;color, long&#8208;life, high&#8208;quantum yield, ultrastable, room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence, along with thermosensitive delayed fluorescence, are developed, and these are applied to higher&#8208;level information encryption and in vivo imaging. The precise control of the singlet&#8211;triplet splitting of carbon dots through precursor engineering introduces a new method to realize smart dual&#8208;channel afterglow materials.








Abstract
The development of single&#8208;system materials that exhibit both multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) with tunable after glow colors and channels is challenging. In this study, four metal&#8208;free carbon dots (CDs) are developed through structural tailoring, and panchromatic high&#8208;brightness RTP is achieved via strong chemical encapsulation in urea. The maximum lifetime and quantum yield reaches 2141 ms and 56.55%, respectively. Moreover, CDs&#8208;IV@urea, prepared via coreshell interaction engineering, exhibits a dual afterglow of red RTP and green TADF. The degree of conjugation and functional groups of precursors affects the binding interactions of the nitrogen cladding on CDs, which in turn stabilizes triplet energy levels and affects the energy gap between S1 and T1 (&#916;EST) to induce multicolor RTP. The enhanced wrapping interaction lowers the &#916;EST, promoting reverse intersystem crossing, which leads to phosphorescence and TADF. This strong coreshell interaction fully stabilizes the triplet state, thus stabilizing the material in water, even in extreme environments such as strong acids and oxidants. These afterglow materials are tested in multicolor, time, and temperature multiencryption as well as in multicolor in vivo bioimaging. Hence, these materials have promising practical applications in information security as well as biomedical diagnosis and treatment.

         <title>Thermal Radiation Annealing for Overcoming Processing Temperature Limitation of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;thermal tolerance flexible perovskite solar cells with excellent mechanical stability are successfully achieved by a new thermal radiation annealing methodology, which aids in the vertical growth of perovskite grains, reduction of grain boundaries, and decrease of lattice mismatch. These microstructural improvements are essential in enhancing the performance of flexible perovskite photovoltaics.








Abstract
Common polymeric conductive electrodes, such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) coated with indium tin oxide, face a major challenge due to their low processing&#8208;temperature limits, attributed to PET's low glass transition temperature (Tg) of (70&#8211;80&#160;&#176;C). This limitation significantly narrows the scope of material selection, limits the processing techniques applicable to the low Tg, and hinders the ripened technology transfer from glass substrates to them. Addressing the temperature constraints of the flexible substrates is impactful yet underexplored, with broader implications for fields beyond photovoltaics. Here, a new thermal radiation annealing methodology is introduced to address this issue. By applying the above Tg radiation annealing in conjunction with thermoelectric cooling, highly ordered molecular packing on PET substrates is successfully created, which is exclusively unachievable due to PET's low thermal tolerance. As a result, in the context of perovskite solar cells, this approach enables the circumvention of high&#8208;temperature annealing limitations of PET substrates, leading to a remarkable flexible device efficiency of 22.61% and a record fill factor of 83.42%. This approach proves especially advantageous for advancing the field of flexible optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Molten Guest&#8208;Mediated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Featuring Multi&#8208;Modal Supramolecular Interaction Sites for Flame&#8208;Retardant Superionic Conductor in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flame&#8208;retardant all&#8208;solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) superionic conductor is constructed, incorporating multiple supramolecular interactions through the embedding of molten polar crystalline organic electrolyte into the anionic nanochannels. The distinctive nanochannels exhibit selective acceleration of Li+ transport within various negative electrostatic chemical environments, concurrently suppressing movement of anions, enabling stable operation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density solid&#8208;state full cells under constrained conditions.








Abstract
The development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with outstanding comprehensive performance is currently a critical challenge for achieving high energy density and safer solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs). In this study, a strategy of nano&#8208;confined in situ solidification is proposed to create a novel category of molten guest&#8208;mediated metal&#8211;organic frameworks, named MGM&#8211;MOFs. By embedding the newly developed molten crystalline organic electrolyte (ML20) into the nanocages of anionic MOF&#8211;OH, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH, characterized by multi&#8208;modal supramolecular interaction sites and continuous negative electrostatic environments within nano&#8208;channels, is achieved. These nanochannels promote ion transport through the successive hopping of Li+ between neighbored negative electrostatic environments and suppress anion movement through the chemical constraint of the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized pore wall. This results in remarkable Li+ conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and high Li+ transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kganode + cathode + electrolyte&#8722;1 under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.

This results in remarkable Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductivity of 7.1 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and high Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transference number of 0.81. Leveraging these advantages, the SSBs assembled with MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH exhibit impressive cycle stability and a high specific energy density of 410.5&#160;Wh kg&lt;sub&gt;anode + cathode + electrolyte&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under constrained conditions and various working temperatures. Unlike flammable traditional MOFs, MGM&#8211;MOF&#8211;OH demonstrates high robustness under various harsh conditions, including ignition, high voltage, and extended to humidity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly for Creating Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices with Monolayer Graphene as Chiral Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices are created through a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly process, designed to generate optical chirality specifically in the terahertz (THz) range. The configuration of these vertical helices is predetermined and programmed prior to the assembly process. Once formed, the continuous monolayer graphene helices in this vertical alignment exhibit pronounced optical chirality, rendering them exceptionally suitable for applications within the THz spectrum.








Abstract
Graphene's emergence enables creating chiral metamaterials in helical shapes for terahertz (THz) applications, overcoming material limitations. However, practical implementation remains theoretical due to fabrication challenges. This paper introduces a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly technique that enables creating vertically&#8208;aligned continuous monolayer graphene helices at microscale with great flexibility and high controllability. This assembly process not only facilitates the creation of 3D microstructures, but also positions the 3D structures from a horizontal to a vertical orientation, achieving an aspect ratio (height/width) of &#8776;2700. As a result, an array of vertically&#8208;aligned graphene helices is formed, reaching up to 4&#160;mm in height, which is equivalent to 4 million times the height of monolayer graphene. The benefit of these 3D chiral structures made from graphene is their capability to infinitely extend in height, interacting with light in ways that are not possible with traditional 2D layering methods. Such an impressive height elevates a level of interaction with light that far surpasses what is achievable with traditional 2D layering methods, resulting in a notable enhancement of optical chirality properties. This approach is applicable to various 2D materials, promising advancements in innovative research and diverse applications across fields.

         <title>Rapid Selenoprotein Activation by Selenium Nanoparticles to Suppresses Osteoclastogenesis and Pathological Bone Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the prompt activation of selenoproteins by lentinan&#8208;functionalized selenium nanoparticles to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss through upregulating GPx1 to repolarize macrophages. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive selenium species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders, with considerable potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Osteoclast hyperactivation stands as a significant pathological factor contributing to the emergence of bone disorders driven by heightened oxidative stress levels. The modulation of the redox balance to scavenge reactive oxygen species emerges as a viable approach to addressing this concern. Selenoproteins, characterized by selenocysteine (SeCys2) as the active center, are crucial for selenium&#8208;based antioxidative stress therapy for inflammatory diseases. This study reveals that surface&#8208;active elemental selenium (Se) nanoparticles, particularly lentinan&#8208;Se (LNT&#8208;Se), exhibit enhanced cellular accumulation and accelerated metabolism to SeCys2, the primary active Se form in biological systems. Consequently, LNT&#8208;Se demonstrates significant inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, in vivo studies underscore the superior therapeutic efficacy of LNT&#8208;Se over SeCys2, potentially attributable to the enhanced stability and safety profile of LNT&#8208;Se. Specifically, LNT&#8208;Se effectively modulates the expression of the selenoprotein GPx1, thereby exerting regulatory control over osteoclastogenesis inhibition, and the prevention of osteolysis. In summary, these results suggest that the prompt activation of selenoproteins by Se nanoparticles serves to suppress osteoclastogenesis and pathological bone loss by upregulating GPx1. Moreover, the utilization of bioactive Se species presents a promising avenue for effectively managing bone disorders.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Ionic&#8208;Conductive Covalent Organic Framework Fibers for Capturing of Sustainable Osmotic Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D covalent organic framework (COF) fibers obtained by processing of COF dispersions using a wet spinning technique: Dispersions of 2D COFs are continuously processed into flexible solid fibers on a large scale using a wet spinning approach. These COF fibers with excellent tensile properties exhibit good performance for the capture of osmotic energy as ionic conductors.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance covalent organic framework (COF) fibers are demanded for an efficient capturing of blue osmotic power because of their excellent durability, simple integration, and large scalability. However, the scalable production of COF fibers is still very challenging due to the poor solubility and fragile structure of COFs. Herein, for the first time, it is reported that COF dispersions can be continuously processed into macroscopic, meter&#8208;long, and pure COF fibers using a wet spinning approach. The two presented COF fibers can be directly used for capturing of osmotic energy, avoiding the production of composite materials that require other additives and face challenges such as phase separation and environmental issues induced by the additives. A COF fiber exhibits power densities of 70.2 and 185.3 W m&#8722;2 at 50&#8208;fold and 500&#8208;fold salt gradients, respectively. These values outperform those of most reported systems, which indicate the high potential of COF fibers for capturing of blue osmotic energy.

         <title>Annual Energy&#8208;Saving Smart Windows with Actively Controllable Passive Radiative Cooling and Multimode Heating Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This smart window not only achieves multistage passive radiative cooling (PRC) efficiency in hot climates but also possesses the capability to deal with complicated heating scenarios due to the combination of triple heating modes including passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH), which provides a feasible way for on&#8208;demand thermal management and reducing year&#8208;round heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) energy loads.








Abstract
Smart windows with radiative heat management capability using the sun and outer space as zero&#8208;energy thermodynamic resources have gained prominence, demonstrating a minimum carbon footprint. However, realizing on&#8208;demand thermal management throughout all seasons while reducing fossil energy consumption remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an energy&#8208;efficient smart window that enables actively tunable passive radiative cooling (PRC) and multimode heating regulation is demonstrated by integrating the emission&#8208;enhanced polymer&#8208;dispersed liquid crystal (SiO2@PRC PDLC) film and a low&#8208;emission layer deposited with carbon nanotubes. Specifically, this device can achieve a temperature close to the chamber interior ambient under solar irradiance of 700&#160;W m&#8722;2, as well as a temperature drop of 2.3&#160;&#176;C at sunlight of 500&#160;W m&#8722;2, whose multistage PRC efficiency can be rapidly adjusted by a moderate voltage. Meanwhile, synchronous cooperation of passive radiative heating (PRH), solar heating (SH), and electric heating (EH) endows this smart window with the capability to handle complicated heating situations during cold weather. Energy simulation reveals the substantial superiority of this device in energy savings compared with single&#8208;layer SiO2@PRC PDLC, normal glass, and commercial low&#8208;E glass when applied in different climate zones. This work provides a feasible pathway for year&#8208;round thermal management, presenting a huge potential in energy&#8208;saving applications.

         <title>Tuneable Current Rectification Through a Designer Graphene Nanoribbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pair of substitutional boron dopants inside a semiconducting graphene nanoribbon localizes a positive&#8208;ion resonance within its bandgap, creating a double&#8208;barrier resonant electronic device. Electric transport through this single&#8208;molecule device suspended between tip and sample of a scanning tunneling microscope reveals unipolar resonant hole tunneling and a peculiar diode effect that can be tuned and reversed with tip&#8208;sample distance.








Abstract
Unimolecular current rectifiers are fundamental building blocks in organic electronics. Rectifying behavior has been identified in numerous organic systems due to electron&#8208;hole asymmetries of orbital levels interfaced by a metal electrode. As a consequence, the rectifying ratio (RR) determining the diode efficiency remains fixed for a chosen molecule&#8208;metal interface. Here, a mechanically tunable molecular diode exhibiting an exceptionally large rectification ratio (&gt;105) and reversible direction is presented. The molecular system comprises a seven&#8208;armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) doped with a single unit of substitutional diboron within its structure, synthesized with atomic precision on a gold substrate by on&#8208;surface synthesis. The diboron unit creates half&#8208;populated in&#8208;gap bound states and splits the GNR frontier bands into two segments, localizing the bound state in a double barrier configuration. By suspending these GNRs freely between the tip of a low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscope and the substrate, unipolar hole transport is demonstrated through the boron in&#8208;gap state's resonance. Strong current rectification is observed, associated with the varying widths of the two barriers, which can be tuned by altering the distance between tip and substrate. This study introduces an innovative approach for the precise manipulation of molecular electronic functionalities, opening new avenues for advanced applications in organic&#160;electronics.

         <title>Design of Excellent Mechanical Performances and Magnetic Refrigeration via In Situ Forming Dual&#8208;Phase Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal and straightforward method for preparing high&#8208;performance magnetocaloric effect (MCE) materials is proposed in this study. By employing a direct melting approach, the magnetocaloric phase precipitates within MCE intermetallic compounds. The prepared dual&#8208;phase alloy achieves a commendable equilibrium between refrigeration capacity and mechanical properties. This strategy holds significant promise for the large&#8208;scale production of magnetic refrigeration materials.








Abstract
Magnetic refrigeration technology can achieve higher energy efficiency based on the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). However, the practical application of MCE materials is hindered by their poor mechanical properties, making them challenging to process into devices. Conventional strengthening strategies usually lead to a trade&#8208;off with refrigeration capacity reduction. Here, a novel design is presented to overcome this dilemma by forming dual&#8208;phase alloys through in situ precipitation of a tough magnetic refrigeration phase within an intermetallic compound with excellent MCE. In the alloy 87.5Gd&#8211;12.5Co, incorporating the interconnected tough phase Gd contributes to enhanced strength (&#8776;505&#160;MPa) with good ductility (&#8776;9.2%). The strengthening phase Gd simultaneously exhibits excellent MCE, enabling the alloy to achieve a peak refrigeration capacity of 720 J kg&#8722;1. Moreover, the alloy shows low thermal expansion induced by the synergistic effect of the two phases. It is beneficial for maintaining structural stability during heat exchange in magnetic refrigeration. The coupling interaction between the two magnetic phases can broaden the refrigeration temperature range and reduce hysteresis. This study guides the development of new high&#8208;performance materials with an excellent combination of mechanical and magnetic refrigeration properties as needed for gas liquefaction and refrigerators.

         <title>Two&#8208;Terminal Perovskite Optoelectronic Synapse for Rapid Trained Neuromorphic Computation with High Accuracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the synergistic effect between ion migration barrier (Ea) and readout voltage (Vread), a stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current is achieved in a dual&#8208;terminal perovskite synapse. The gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs.








Abstract
Emerging neural morphological vision sensors inspired by biological systems that integrate image perception, memory, and information computing are expected to transform the landscape of machine vision and artificial intelligence. However, stable and reconfigurable light&#8208;induced synaptic behavior always relies on independent gateport modulation. Despite its potential, the limitations of uncontrollable defects and ionic characteristics have led to simpler, smaller, and more integration&#8208;friendly two&#8208;terminal devices being used as sidelines. In this work, the synergy between ion migration barriers and readout voltage is proven to be the key to realizing stable, reconfigurable, and precisely controllable postsynaptic current in two&#8208;terminal devices. Following the same mechanism, optical and electrical signal synchronous triggering is proposed to serve as a preprocessing method to achieve a recognition accuracy of 96.5%. Impressively, the gradual ion accumulation during the training process induces photocurrent evolution, serving as a reference for the dynamic learning rate and boosting accuracy to 97.8% in just 10 epochs. The PSC modulation potential under short optical pulse of 20 ns is also revealed. This optoelectronic device with perception, memory, and computation capabilities can promote the development of new devices for future photonic neural morphological circuits and artificial vision.

         <title>Toughening Hydrogels with Fibrillar Connected Double Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough hydrogels with low plastic deformations based on fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN) are presented. The efficient transfer of stress between the polyacrylamide and agarose fibril networks via chemical crosslinks and better fibril alignment under stretch result in high fracture strength and toughness (55 MJ m&#8722;3). The fc&#8208;DN provides a new toughening strategy and application potential for load&#8208;bearing soft devices.








Abstract
Biological tissues, such as tendons or cartilage, possess high strength and toughness with very low plastic deformations. In contrast, current strategies to prepare tough hydrogels commonly utilize energy dissipation mechanisms based on physical bonds that lead to irreversible large plastic deformations, thus limiting their load&#8208;bearing applications. This article reports a strategy to toughen hydrogels using fibrillar connected double networks (fc&#8208;DN), which consist of two distinct but chemically interconnected polymer networks, that is, a polyacrylamide network and an acrylated agarose fibril network. The fc&#8208;DN design allows efficient stress transfer between the two networks and high fibril alignment during deformation, both contributing to high strength and toughness, while the chemical crosslinking ensures low plastic deformations after undergoing high strains. The mechanical properties of the fc&#8208;DN network can be readily tuned to reach an ultimate tensile strength of 8 MPa and a toughness of above 55 MJ m&#8722;3, which is 3 and 3.5 times more than that of fibrillar double network hydrogels without chemical connections, respectively. The application potential of the fc&#8208;DN hydrogel is demonstrated as load&#8208;bearing damping material for a jointed robotic lander. The fc&#8208;DN design provides a new toughening mechanism for hydrogels that can be used for soft robotics or bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Boosting External Quantum Efficiency of Blue Perovskite QLEDs Exceeding 23% by Trifluoroacetate Passivation and Mixed Hole Transportation Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Blue perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diode (QLED) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.5% at 490 nm is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivated by trifluoroacetate and optimal device design through a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dot&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been considered a promising display technology due to their wide color gamut for authentic color expression. Currently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art blue perovskite QLEDs is about 15%, which still lags behind its green and red counterparts (&gt;25%) and blue film&#8208;based LEDs. Here, blue perovskite QLEDs that achieve an EQE of 23.5% at 490&#160;nm is presented, to the best knowledge, which is the highest value reported among blue perovskite&#8208;based LED fields. This impressive efficiency is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivation and optimal device design. First, blue mixed halide perovskite CsPbCl3&#8722;xBrx QDs passivated by trifluoroacetate exhibit excellent exciton recombination behavior with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 84% due to reducing uncoordinated Pb surface defects. Furthermore, the device is designed by introducing a mixed hole&#8208;transport layer (M&#8208;HTL) to increase hole injection and transportation capacity and improve carrier balance. It is further found that M&#8208;HTL can decrease carrier leakage and increase radiative recombination in the device, evidenced by the visual electroluminescence spectrum at 2.0&#160;V. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite&#8208;based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.

&lt;p&gt;Blue perovskite quantum dot-based light-emitting diode (QLED) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.5% at 490 nm is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivated by trifluoroacetate and optimal device design through a mixed hole-transport layer. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite-based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite quantum dot-based light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) have been considered a promising display technology due to their wide color gamut for authentic color expression. Currently, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) for state-of-the-art blue perovskite QLEDs is about 15%, which still lags behind its green and red counterparts (&amp;gt;25%) and blue film-based LEDs. Here, blue perovskite QLEDs that achieve an EQE of 23.5% at 490&#160;nm is presented, to the best knowledge, which is the highest value reported among blue perovskite-based LED fields. This impressive efficiency is achieved through a combination of quantum dot (QD) passivation and optimal device design. First, blue mixed halide perovskite CsPbCl&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Br&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; QDs passivated by trifluoroacetate exhibit excellent exciton recombination behavior with a photoluminescence quantum yield of 84% due to reducing uncoordinated Pb surface defects. Furthermore, the device is designed by introducing a mixed hole-transport layer (M-HTL) to increase hole injection and transportation capacity and improve carrier balance. It is further found that M-HTL can decrease carrier leakage and increase radiative recombination in the device, evidenced by the visual electroluminescence spectrum at 2.0&#160;V. The work breaks through the EQE gap of 20% for blue perovskite-based QLEDs and significantly promotes their commercialization process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heterogeneous Nucleating Agent for High&#8208;Boiling&#8208;Point Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The heterogeneous nucleating agent (BTO&#8208;BO) is developed to suppress the excessive aggregation of L8&#8208;BO in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents processing, achieving the active layer with high crystallinity and nano&#8208;scaled phase separation morphology. The resultant OSCs achieve record power conversion efficiencies of 19.42% (0.062&#8208;cm2) and 16.35% (15. 03&#8208;cm2) with excellent operational stabilities.








Abstract
High&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents are superior solvents to produce large&#8208;area organic solar cells (OSCs) in industry because of their wide processing window and low toxicity; while, these solvents with slow evaporation kinetics will lead excessive aggregation of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art small molecule acceptors (e.g. L8&#8208;BO), delivering serious efficiency losses. Here, a heterogeneous nucleating agent strategy is developed by grafting oligo (ethylene glycol) side&#8208;chains on L8&#8208;BO (BTO&#8208;BO). The formation energy of the obtained BTO&#8208;BO; while, changing from liquid in a solvent to a crystalline phase, is lower than that of L8&#8208;BO irrespective of the solvent type. When BTO&#8208;BO is added as the third component into the active layer (e.g. PM6:L8&#8208;BO), it easily assembles to form numerous seed crystals, which serve as nucleation sites to trigger heterogeneous nucleation and increase nucleation density of L8&#8208;BO through strong hydrogen bonding interactions even in high&#8208;boiling&#8208;point nonhalogenated solvents. Therefore, it can effectively suppress excessive aggregation during growth, achieving ideal phase&#8208;separation active layer with small domain sizes and high crystallinity. The resultant toluene&#8208;processed OSCs exhibit a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.42% (certificated 19.12%) with excellent operational stability. The strategy also has superior advantages in large&#8208;scale devices, showing a 15.03&#8208;cm2 module with a record PCE of 16.35% (certificated 15.97%).

         <title>Precise Capture and Dynamic Release of Circulating Liver Cancer Cells with Dual&#8208;Histidine&#8208;Based Cell Imprinted Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Targeting the sialylated glycans present on circulating tumor cells&#8217; (CTCs) surface, an ultrastrong affinity ligand His&#8208;His is designed and integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinting copolymer based on polyethylene glycol dimethacrylate. Precise size matching, specific interactions, and satisfactory biocompatibility endow the material with excellent capabilities for precise capture of CTCs and intact release, significantly facilitating liver cancer early diagnosis and single&#8208;cell multiproteomics analysis.








Abstract
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) detection presents significant advantages in diagnosing liver cancer due to its noninvasiveness, real&#8208;time monitoring, and dynamic tracking. However, the clinical application of CTCs&#8208;based diagnosis is largely limited by the challenges of capturing low&#8208;abundance CTCs within a complex blood environment while ensuring them alive. Here, an ultrastrong ligand, l&#8208;histidine&#8211;l&#8208;histidine (HH), specifically targeting sialylated glycans on the surface of CTCs, is designed. Furthermore, HH is integrated into a cell&#8208;imprinted polymer, constructing a hydrogel with precise CTCs imprinting, high elasticity, satisfactory blood compatibility, and robust anti&#8208;interference capacities. These features endow the hydrogel with excellent capture efficiency (&gt;95%) for CTCs in peripheral blood, as well as the ability to release CTCs controllably and alive. Clinical tests substantiate the accurate differentiation between liver cancer, cirrhosis, and healthy groups using this method. The remarkable diagnostic accuracy (94%), lossless release of CTCs, material reversibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness ($6.68 per sample) make the HH&#8208;based hydrogel a potentially revolutionary technology for liver cancer diagnosis and single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Li Promoting Long Afterglow Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Memory Optocoupler Module</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low power consumption long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors are fabricated to simultaneously accomplish the functions of in&#8208;memory calculation, light&#8208;emission, and decision&#8208;making process. When combined with optically switchable transistors and photodiode amplifiers, the biological neurotransmitter transfer and biological firing action after spiking excess threshold are mimicked in the chip.








Abstract
The artificial brain is conceived as advanced intelligence technology, capable to emulate in&#8208;memory processes occurring in the human brain by integrating synaptic devices. Within this context, improving the functionality of synaptic transistors to increase information processing density in neuromorphic chips is a major challenge in this field. In this article, Li&#8208;ion migration promoting long afterglow organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, which display exceptional postsynaptic brightness of 7000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 under low operational voltages of 10&#160;V is presented. The postsynaptic current of 0.1&#160;mA operating as a built&#8208;in threshold switch is implemented as a firing point in these devices. The setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow is employed to drive the photoisomerization process of photochromic molecules that mimic neurotransmitter transfer in the human brain for realizing a key memory rule, that is, the transition from long&#8208;term memory to permanent memory. The combination of setting&#8208;condition&#8208;triggered long afterglow with photodiode amplifiers is also processed to emulate the human responding action after the setting&#8208;training process. Overall, the successful integration in neuromorphic computing comprising stimulus judgment, photon emission, transition, and encoding, &#160;to emulate the complicated decision tree of the human brain is demonstrated.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaic Cells for Underwater Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acceptor is designed and named ITO&#8208;4Cl and provides a comprehensive evaluation of its photovoltaic performance, stability, and pressure resistance when incorporated into organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Particularly, the OPV cells exhibit a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.6% at a depth of 1&#160;m underwater, confirming the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.








Abstract
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) technology holds tremendous promise as a sustainable power source for underwater off&#8208;grid systems. However, research on underwater OPV cells is relatively scarce. Here, this gap is addressed by focusing on the exploration and development of OPV cells specifically designed for underwater applications. An acceptor, named ITO&#8208;4Cl, with excellent water resistance, is rationally designed and synthesized. Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well&#8208;suited to the underwater environment, the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1&#160;m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO&#8208;4Cl&#8208;based OPV cell exceeds 7000&#160;h. Additionally, a flexible OPV cell is fabricated that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5&#160;cm2 flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. This work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.

Benefiting from its low energetic disorder and an absorption spectrum well-suited to the underwater environment, the ITO-4Cl-based OPV cell achieves an unprecedented power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 25.6% at a water depth of 1&#160;m. Additionally, under 660&#160;nm laser irradiation, the cell demonstrates a notable PCE of 31.6%, indicating its potential for underwater wireless energy transfer. Due to the mitigation of thermal effects from solar irradiation, the lifetime of the ITO-4Cl-based OPV cell exceeds 7000&#160;h. Additionally, a flexible OPV cell is fabricated that maintains its initial PCE even under exposure to high pressures of 5&#160;MPa. A 32.5&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible module achieves an excellent PCE of 17%. This work fosters a deeper understanding of underwater OPV cells and highlights the promising prospects of OPV cells for underwater applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Immunogenic Material Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy by Structure&#8208;Dependent Immune Cell Trafficking and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Immunogenic material vaccines offer enormous prospects in treating cancer. Here we&#160;report how the structure of materials containing immunopotentiator manganese impacts the dynamic coordination of innate and adaptive immune response. The outperformed rod&#8208;shaped hollow manganese material with an aspect ratio of 4.5 demonstrates the highest competence in immune cell modulation and cellular immunity against cancer in multiple aggressive tumor models.








Abstract
Inherently immunogenic materials offer enormous prospects in enhancing vaccine efficacy. However, the understanding and improving material adjuvanticity remain elusive. Herein how the structural presentation of immunopotentiators in a material governs the dynamic dialogue between innate and adaptive immunity for enhanced cancer vaccination is reported. The immunopotentiator manganese into six differing structures that resemble the architectures of two types of pathogens (spherical viruses or rod&#8208;like bacteria) is precisely manipulated. The results reveal that innate immune cells accurately sense and respond to the architectures, of which two outperformed material candidates (151&#160;nm hollow spheres and hollow microrods with an aspect ratio of 4.5) show higher competence in creating local proinflammatory environment with promoted innate immune cell influx and stimulation on dendritic cells (DCs). In combination with viral peptides, model proteins, or cell lysate antigens, the outperformed microrod material remarkably primes antigen&#8208;specific CD8 cytolytic T cells. In prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, the microrod adjuvanted vaccines display optimal aptitude in tumor suppression in four aggressive murine tumor models, by promoting the infiltration of heterogeneous cytolytic effector cells while decreasing suppressive immunoregulatory populations in tumors. This study demonstrates that a rationally selected architecture of immunogenic materials potentially advances the clinical reality of cancer vaccination.

         <title>Chlorination Design for Highly Stable Electrolyte toward High Mass Loading and Long Cycle Life Sodium&#8208;Based Dual&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorination design strategy is proposed for sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries, and as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the chlorinated electrolyte based on chloromethyl ethyl carbonate displays notably enhanced oxidative stability and highly reversible anion intercalation into the graphite cathode; meanwhile, the uniform and efficient plating/stripping of Na+ ions on the anode is also achieved.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;based dual ion batteries (SDIBs) have garnered significant attention as novel energy storage devices offering the advantages of high&#8208;voltage and low&#8208;cost. Nonetheless, conventional electrolytes exhibit low resistance to oxidation and poor compatibility with electrode materials, resulting in rapid battery failure. In this study, for the first time, a chlorination design of electrolytes for SDIB, is proposed. Using ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as a representative, chlorine (Cl)&#8208;substituted EMC not only demonstrates increased oxidative stability ascribed to the electron&#8208;withdrawing characteristics of chlorine atom, electrolyte compatibility with both the cathode and anode is also greatly improved by forming Cl&#8208;containing interface layers. Consequently, a discharge capacity of 104.6 mAh g&#8722;1 within a voltage range of 3.0&#8211;5.0&#160;V is achieved for Na||graphite SDIB that employs a high graphite cathode mass loading of 5.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, along with almost no capacity decay after 900 cycles. Notably, the Na||graphite SDIB can be revived for an additional 900 cycles through the replacement of a fresh Na anode. As the mass loading of graphite cathode increased to 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, Na||graphite SDIB is still capable of sustaining over 700 times with &#8776;100% capacity retention. These results mark the best outcome among reported SDIBs. This study corroborates the effectiveness of chlorination design in developing high&#8208;voltage electrolytes and attaining enduring cycle stability of Na&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Enzymatic Mesoporous Metal Nanocavities for Concurrent Electrocatalysis of Nitrate to Ammonia Coupled with Polyethylene Terephthalate Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as an enzymatic bifunctional electrocatalyst for concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and glycolic acid from waste pollutants (NO3&#8722; and polyethylene&#8208;terephthalate&#8208;derived alcohol). Thanks to structural synergies, the performance of PdCu MC nanozymes outperforms the most of the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Electrochemical upcycling of waste pollutants into high value&#8208;added fuels and/or chemicals is recognized as a green and sustainable solution that can address the resource utilization on earth. Despite great efforts, their progress has seriously been hindered by the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. In this work, bimetallic PdCu mesoporous nanocavities (MCs) are reported as a new bifunctional enzymatic electrocatalyst that realizes concurrent electrocatalytic upcycling of nitrate wastewater and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic waste. Abundant metal mesopores and open nanocavities of PdCu MCs provide the enzymatic confinement of key intermediates for the deeper electroreduction of nitrate and accelerate the transport of reactants/products within/out of electrocatalyst, thus affording high ammonia Faradic efficiency (FENH3) of 96.6% and yield rate of 5.6&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;mg&#8722;1 at the cathode. Meanwhile, PdCu MC nanozymes trigger the selective electrooxidation of PET&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) into glycolic acid (GA) and formic acid with high FEs of &gt;90% by a facile regulation of potentials at the anode. Moreover, concurrent electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added NH3 and GA is disclosed in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system, further confirming the high efficiency of bifunctional PdCu MC nanozymes in producing value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals from waste pollutants in a sustainable manner.

         <title>Noncontact Microfluidics of Highly Viscous Liquids for Accurate Self&#8208;Splitting and Pipetting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the highly transparent PS platform, the liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s (epoxy) can be noncontact split with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source. Compared with commercial pipettes or droppers (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate PS platform (&gt;83.5%) shows great potential in the quantification of highly viscous liquids.








Abstract
Accurate dosing for various liquids, especially for highly viscous liquids, is fundamental in wide&#8208;ranging from molecular crosslinking to material processing. Despite droppers or pipettes being widely used as pipetting devices, they are powerless for quantificationally splitting and dosing highly viscous liquids (&gt;100&#160;mPa s) like polymer liquids due to the intertwined macromolecular chains and strong cohesion energy. Here, a highly transparent photopyroelectric slippery (PS) platform is provided to achieve noncontact self&#8208;splitting for liquids with viscosity as high as 15&#160;000&#160;mPa s, just with the assistance of sunlight and a cooling source to provide a local temperature difference (&#916;T). Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy for pipetting liquids (&gt;80%), the ultrathin MXene film (within a thickness of 20&#160;nm) is self&#8208;assembled as the photo&#8208;thermal layers, overcoming the trade&#8208;off between transparency and photothermal property. Compared with traditional pipetting strategies (&#8776;1.3% accuracy for pipetting polymer liquids), this accurate microfluidic chip shows great potential in adhesive systems (bonding strength, twice than using the droppers or pipettes).

         <title>Anchored Cobalt Nanoparticles on Layered Perovskites for Rapid Peroxymonosulfate Activation in Antibiotic Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy for perovskite oxide catalysts is proposed to address two limiting factors in the development of advanced oxidation process (AOPs): the activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and the cycling stability of metal catalysts. The comprehensive performance of the catalysts is tested to highlight the technical potential of the PMS heterogeneous reaction&#8208;activated in situ exsolved strategy.








Abstract
In the Fenton&#8208;like reaction, revealing the dynamic evolution of the active sites is crucial to achieve the activity improvement and stability of the catalyst. This study reports a perovskite oxide in which atomic (Co0) in situ embedded exsolution occurs during the high&#8208;temperature phase transition. This unique anchoring strategy significantly improves the Co3+/Co2+ cycling efficiency at the interface and inhibits metal leaching during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. The Co@L&#8208;PBMC catalyst exhibits superior PMS activation ability and could achieve 99% degradation of tetracycline within 5&#160;min. The combination of experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidates that the electron&#8208;deficient oxygen vacancy accepts an electron from the Co 3d&#8208;orbital, resulting in a significant electron delocalization of the Co site, thereby facilitating the adsorption of the *HSO5/*OH intermediate onto the &#8220;metal&#8208;VO bridge&#8221; structure. This work provides insights into the PMS activation mechanism at the atomic level, which will guide the rational design of next&#8208;generation catalysts for environmental remediation.

         <title>Sulfur&#8208;Tuned Main&#8208;Group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C Catalysts for Selective 2&#8208;Electron and 4&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts are developed with varied oxidation states of the Sb sites via changing the contents of sulfur dopants, resulting in tunable ORR selectivity toward either the 4&#8208;electron or 2&#8208;electron pathway.








Abstract
The selective oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is important for various energy conversion processes such as the fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries for the 4e&#8722; pathway and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis for the 2e&#8722; pathway. However, it remains a challenge to tune the ORR selectivity of a catalyst in a controllable manner. Herein, an efficient strategy for introducing sulfur dopants to regulate the ORR selectivity of main&#8208;group Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C single&#8208;atom catalysts&#160; is reported. Significantly, Sb&#8722;N&#8722;C with the highest sulfur content follows a 2e&#8722; pathway with high H2O2 selectivity (96.8%) and remarkable mass activity (96.1 A g&#8722;1 at 0.65&#160;V), while the sister catalyst with the lowest sulfur content directs a 4e&#8722; pathway with a half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.89&#160;V) that is more positive than commercial Pt/C. In addition, practical applications for these two 2e&#8722;/4e&#8722; ORR catalysts are demonstrated by bulk H2O2 electrosynthesis for the degradation of organic pollutants and a high&#8208;power zinc&#8208;air battery, respectively. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the excellent selectivity for the sulfurized Sb&#8722;N&#8722;Cs is attributed to the optimal adsorption&#8208;desorption of the ORR intermediates realized through the electronic structure modulation by the sulfur dopants.

         <title>Thermal Welding of Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep understanding of the assembly behavior of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) that are generated in situ at the oil&#8211;water interface through host&#8211;guest interactions is presented. Taking advantage of the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, thermal&#8208;controlled cargo release and welding of liquids can be achieved, opening a pathway to the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics.








Abstract
Welding of thermoplastics is a common practice in many industrial sectors, but it has yet to be realized with fluids. Here, the thermal welding of liquids by using the assembly and jamming of nanoparticle surfactants (NPSs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces is reported. By fine&#8208;tuning the dynamic interaction strength within NPSs, the interfacial activity of NPSs, as well as the binding energy of NPSs to the interface can be precisely controlled, leading to a dynamic exchange of NPSs, maximizing the reduction in the interfacial energy. With NPSs jammed at the interface, the structures of liquids can be manipulated to complex geometries by applying an external force and, due to the temperature responsiveness of NPSs, when bringing liquids into contact and heating the system, welding of liquids can be achieved. This work provides a straightforward strategy for the construction of modular all&#8208;liquid fluidics, opening up numerous opportunities in fields like biotechnology, healthcare, and materials science.

         <title>Universal Design Strategy for Air&#8208;Stable Layered Na&#8208;Ion Cathodes toward Sustainable Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon footprint of Na&#8208;ion batteries is significantly increased due to the air stability issue of layered cathodes. In this paper, the air degradation origins and mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, and a universal design strategy is proposed for the rational design of air&#8208;stable Na&#8208;ion cathodes toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.








Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries (NIBs) are sustainable alternatives to Li&#8208;ion technologies due to the abundant and widely&#8208;distributed resources. However, the most promising cathode materials of NIBs so far, O3 layered oxides, suffer from serious air instability issues, which significantly increases the manufactural cost and carbon footprint because of the long&#8208;term use of dry rooms. While some feasible strategies are proposed via case studies, universal design strategies for air&#8208;stable cathodes are yet to be established. Herein, the air degradation mechanisms of O3 cathodes are investigated via combined first&#8208;principles and experimental approaches, with bond dissociation energy proposed as an effective descriptor for predicting air stability. Experimental validations in various unary, binary, and ternary O3 cathodes confirm that the air stability can indeed be effectively improved via simple compositional design. Guided by the predictive model, the designed material can sustain 30&#8208;day air&#8208;storage without structural or electrochemical degradation. It is calculated that such air&#8208;stable cathodes can significantly reduce both energy consumption (&#8776;4&#8201;100&#8201;000&#160;kWh) and carbon footprint (&#8776;2200&#8208;ton CO2) annually for a 2 GWh NIBs manufactory. Therefore, the fundamental understandings and universal design strategy presented open an avenue for rational materials design of NIBs toward both elemental and manufactural sustainability.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Antisymmetric Magnetoresistance in van der Waals Ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic material Fe3GaTe2 is synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method. An unconventional room&#8208;temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance is observed in 2D Fe3GaTe2 devices with the planar symmetry breaking. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room&#8208;temperature thickness&#8208;controlled antisymmetric magnetoresistance.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic materials have emerged as a promising platform for the development of 2D spintronic devices. However, studies to date are restricted to vdW ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature (Tc) and small magnetic anisotropy. Here, a chemical vapor transport method is developed to synthesize a high&#8208;quality room&#8208;temperature ferromagnet, Fe3GaTe2 (c&#8208;Fe3GaTe2), which boasts a high Tc = 356 K and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.

&lt;p&gt;A high-quality room-temperature ferromagnetic material Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is synthesized by the chemical vapor transport method. An unconventional room-temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance is observed in 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices with the planar symmetry breaking. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room-temperature thickness-controlled antisymmetric magnetoresistance.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnetic materials have emerged as a promising platform for the development of 2D spintronic devices. However, studies to date are restricted to vdW ferromagnetic materials with low Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;) and small magnetic anisotropy. Here, a chemical vapor transport method is developed to synthesize a high-quality room-temperature ferromagnet, Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (c-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which boasts a high &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 356 K and large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Due to the planar symmetry breaking, an unconventional room-temperature antisymmetric magnetoresistance (MR) is first observed in c-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; devices with step features, manifesting as three distinctive states of high, intermediate, and low resistance with the sweeping magnetic field. Moreover, the modulation of the antisymmetric MR is demonstrated by controlling the height of the surface steps. This work provides new routes to achieve magnetic random storage and logic devices by utilizing the room-temperature thickness-controlled antisymmetric MR and further design room-temperature 2D spintronic devices based on the vdW ferromagnet c-Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GaTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Harvesting Multicolor Photoluminescence in Nonaromatic Interpenetrated Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanocrystals via Pressure&#8208;Modulated Carbonyls Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 IRMOF&#8208;0 nanocrystals (NCs)&#160;show a photoluminescence&#160;turn&#8208;on behavior via pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect, where aggregation of carbonyls&#160;results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;). IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit an ultrabroad emission tunability, which mainly arises from the retention at varying degrees of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions achieved by pressure&#8208;treated engineering.








Abstract
Interpenetrated metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with nonaromatic ligands provide a unique platform for adsorption, catalysis, and sensing applications. However, nonemission and the lack of optical property tailoring make it challenging to fabricate smart responsive devices with nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs based on ligand&#8208;centered emission. In this paper, the pressure&#8208;induced aggregation effect is introduced in nonaromatic interpenetrated Zn4O(ADC)4(Et3N)6 (IRMOF&#8208;0) nanocrystals (NCs), where carbonyl groups aggregation results in O&#9472;O distances smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii (3.04 &#197;), triggering the photoluminescence turn&#8208;on behavior. It is noteworthy that the IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs display an ultrabroad emission tunability of 130&#160;nm from deep blue (440&#160;nm) to yellow (570&#160;nm) upon release to ambient conditions at different pressures. The eventual retention of through&#8208;space n&#8211;&#960;* interactions in different degrees via pressure treatment is primarily responsible for achieving a controllable multicolor emission behavior in initially nonemissive IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs. The fabricated multicolor phosphor&#8208;converted light&#8208;emitting diodes based on the pressure&#8208;treated IRMOF&#8208;0 NCs exhibit excellent thermal, chromaticity, and fatigue stability. The proposed strategy not only imparts new vitality to nonaromatic interpenetrated MOFs but also offers new perspectives for advancements in the field of multicolor displays and daylight illumination.

         <title>Influence of Li Content on the Topological Inhibition of Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In Li&#8208;rich layered oxide cathodes, the formation of a migration network of redox&#8208;active oxygen ions can be prevented when the transition metal ions occupy over 5/6 of the sites in the transition metal layer, and thereby, the oxidized oxygen species can be encaged in the lattice, leading to topological inhibition of oxygen loss during cycling.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;rich layer oxide cathodes are promising energy storage materials due to their high energy densities. However, the oxygen loss during cycling limits their practical applications. Here, the essential role of Li content on the topological inhibition of oxygen loss in lithium&#8208;rich cathode materials and the relationship between the migration network of oxygen ions and the transition metal (TM) component are revealed. Utilizing first&#8208;principles calculations in combination with percolation theory and Monte Carlo simulations, it is found that TM ions can effectively encage the oxidized oxygen species when the TM concentration in TM layer exceeds 5/6, which hinders the formation of a percolating oxygen migration network. This study demonstrates the significance of rational compositional design in lithium&#8208;rich cathodes for effectively suppressing irreversible oxygen release and enhancing cathode cycling performance.

         <title>Boosting Contact Electrification by Amorphous Polyvinyl Alcohol Endowing Improved Contact Adhesion and Electrochemical Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stronger binding to water molecules, and the consequent higher water uptake, is shown to be responsible for the improved electrical output of triboelectric generators and sensors based on an amorphous polyvinyl alcohol compared to the more common homopolymer derivative. The specific role played by the increased material softness, adhesive contact, and ionic conductivity on devices performance is highlighted.








Abstract
Ion conductive hydrogels are relevant components in wearable, biocompatible, and biodegradable electronics. Polyvinyl&#8208;alcohol (PVA) homopolymer is often the favored choice for integration into supercapacitors and energy harvesters as in sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). However, to further improve hydrogel&#8208;based TENGs, a deeper understanding of the impact of their composition and structure on devices performance is necessary. Here, it is shown how ionic hydrogels based on an amorphous&#8208;PVA (a&#8208;PVA) allow to fabricate TENGs that outperform the one based on the homopolymer. When used as tribomaterial, the Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA allows to achieve a twofold higher pressure sensitivity compared to PVA, and to develop a conformable e&#8208;skin. When used as an ionic conductor encased in an elastomeric tribomaterial, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 average power is obtained, providing 25% power increase compared to PVA. At the origin of such enhancement is the increased softness, stronger adhesive contact, higher ionic mobility (&gt; 3,5&#8208;fold increase), and long&#8208;term stability achieved with Li&#8208;doped a&#8208;PVA. These improvements are attributed to the high density of hydroxyl groups and amorphous structure present in the a&#8208;PVA, enabling&#160;a strong binding to water molecules. This work discloses novel insights on those&#160;parameters allowing to&#160;develop&#160;easy&#8208;processable,&#160;stable, and highly conductive hydrogels for integration in conformable, soft, and biocompatible TENGs.

         <title>Ultimately Adaptive Fluid Interfacial Phospholipid Membranes Unveiled Unanticipated High Cellular Mechanical Work</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ideally adaptive cellular scaffold is developed by decorating a fluid interface with phospholipid membranes. In contrast to conventional solid or hydrogel scaffolds, cell adhesion behaviors thereon follow an adaptive wetting regime with surprisingly high mechanical work, which highlights an analogy of cell adhesion behaviors and droplet wetting on surfaces with a low Young's modulus.








Abstract
Living cells actively interact biochemically and mechanically with the surrounding extracellular matrices (ECMs) and undergo dramatic morphological and dimensional transitions, concomitantly remodeling ECMs. However, there is no suitable method to quantitatively discuss the contribution of mechanical interactions in such mutually adaptive processes. Herein, a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold is developed to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8211;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell&#8208;adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid&#8208;like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime is identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process is one order of magnitude higher than those reported with&#160;conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular&#8208;force&#8208;driven high&#8208;energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.

Herein, a highly deformable &#8220;living&#8221; cellular scaffold is developed to evaluate overall mechanical energy transfer between cell and ECMs. It is based on the water&#8211;perfluorocarbon interface decorated with phospholipids bearing a cell-adhesive ligand and fluorescent tag. The bioinert nature of the phospholipid membranes prevents the formation of solid-like protein nanofilms at the fluid interface, enabling to visualize and quantify cellular mechanical work against the ultimately adaptive model ECM. A new cellular wetting regime is identified, wherein interface deformation proceeds to cell flattening, followed by its eventual restoration. The cellular mechanical work during this adaptive wetting process is one order of magnitude higher than those reported with&#160;conventional elastic platforms. The behavior of viscous liquid drops at the air&#8211;water interface can simulate cellular adaptive wetting, suggesting that overall viscoelasticity of the cell body predominates the emergent wetting regime and regulates mechanical output. Cellular-force-driven high-energy states on the adaptive platform can be useful for cell fate manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Durable Perovskite Solar Cells with 24.5% Average Efficiency: The Role of Rigid Conjugated Core in Molecular Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dibenzo[g,p]chrysene, a non&#8208;planar double helicene, displays enhanced rigidity compared to tetraphenylethene, enabling the development of a molecular semiconductor with elevated cohesive energy density and hole mobility. Applied in high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cell fabrication, it exhibits remarkable operational stability at 45&#160;&#176;C and storage stability at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Efficient and robust n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells necessitate superior organic hole&#8208;transport materials with both mechanical and electronic prowess. Deciphering the structure&#8211;property relationship of these materials is crucial for practical perovskite solar cell applications. Through direct arylation, two high glass transition temperature molecular semiconductors, DBC&#8208;ETPA (202&#160;&#176;C) and TPE&#8208;ETPA (180&#160;&#176;C) are synthesized, using dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (DBC) and 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetraphenylethene (TPE) tetrabromides with triphenylene&#8211;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;dimethoxytriphenylamine (ETPA). In comparison to spiro&#8208;OMeTAD, both semiconductors exhibit shallower HOMO energy levels, resulting in increased hole densities (generated by air oxidation doping) and accelerated hole extraction from photoexcited perovskite. Experimental and theoretical studies highlight the more rigid DBC core, enhancing hole mobility due to reduced reorganization energy and lower energy disorder. Importantly, DBC&#8208;ETPA possesses a higher cohesive energy density, leading to lower ion diffusion coefficients and higher Young's moduli. Leveraging these attributes, DBC&#8208;ETPA is employed as the primary hole&#8208;transport layer component, yielding perovskite solar cells with an average efficiency of 24.5%, surpassing spiro&#8208;OMeTAD reference cells (24.0%). Furthermore, DBC&#8208;ETPA&#8208;based cells exhibit superior operational stability and 85&#160;&#176;C thermal storage stability.

         <title>A Glucose&#8208;Responsive Cannula for Automated and Electronics&#8208;Free Insulin Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is presented for automated insulin delivery without the use of electronics. This cannula, composed of a resilient elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid, changes its permeability in response to glucose levels. Tested in diabetic mice, it effectively maintains blood glucose levels within target ranges for &#8776;3&#160;d, offering a potential solution for user&#8208;centric insulin delivery.








Abstract
Automated delivery of insulin based on continuous glucose monitoring is revolutionizing the way insulin&#8208;dependent diabetes is treated. However, challenges remain for the widespread adoption of these systems, including the requirement of a separate glucose sensor, sophisticated electronics and algorithms, and the need for significant user input to operate these costly therapies. Herein, a user&#8208;centric glucose&#8208;responsive cannula is reported for electronics&#8208;free insulin delivery. The cannula&#8212;made from a tough, elastomer&#8208;hydrogel hybrid membrane formed through a one&#8208;pot solvent exchange method&#8212;changes permeability to release insulin rapidly upon physiologically relevant varying glucose levels, providing simple and automated insulin delivery with no additional hardware or software. Two prototypes of the cannula are evaluated in insulin&#8208;deficient diabetic mice. The first cannula&#8212;an ends&#8208;sealed, subcutaneously inserted prototype&#8212;normalizes blood glucose levels for 3&#160;d and controls postprandial glucose levels. The second, more translational version&#8212;a cannula with the distal end sealed and the proximal end connected to a transcutaneous injection port&#8212;likewise demonstrates tight, 3&#8208;d regulation of blood glucose levels when refilled twice daily. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study may aid in the development of &#8220;smart&#8221; cannulas and next&#8208;generation insulin therapies at a reduced burden&#8208;of&#8208;care toll and cost to end&#8208;users.

         <title>Boosting Formate Electrooxidation by Heterostructured PtPd Alloy and Oxides Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant heterojunction interfaces and defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method. PtPd&#8208;ox NWs with optimal electronic structure achieve dual regulation via both regulating key intermediate adsorption behavior and coupling key reaction processes, demonstrating remarkable performance toward formate electrooxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct formate fuel cells (DFFCs) receive increasing attention as promising technologies for the future energy mix and environmental sustainability, as formate can be made from carbon dioxide utilization and is carbon neutral. Herein, heterostructured platinum&#8208;palladium&#160;alloy and oxides nanowires (PtPd&#8208;ox NWs) with abundant defect sites are synthesized through a facile self&#8208;template method and demonstrated high activity toward formate electrooxidation reaction (FOR). The electronic tuning arising from the heterojunction between alloy and oxides influence the work function of PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. The sample with optimal work function reveals the favorable adsorption behavior for intermediates and strong interaction in the d&#8722;p orbital hybridization between Pt site and oxygen in formate, favoring the FOR direct pathway with a low energy barrier. Besides the thermodynamic regulation, the heterostructure can also provide sufficient hydroxyl species to facilitate the formation of carbon dioxide due to the ability of combining absorbed hydrogen and carbon monoxide at adjacent active sites, which contributes to the improvement of FOR kinetics on PtPd&#8208;ox NWs. Thus, heterostructured PtPd&#8208;ox NWs achieve dual regulation of FOR thermodynamics and kinetics, exhibiting remarkable performance and demonstrating potential in practical systems.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanometer Mono&#8208;Layered Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets for Simulated Flue Gas Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) is successfully prepared with remarkable performance in selective CO2 photo&#8208;reduction into formic acid under simulated flue gas.








Abstract
The dilemma between the thickness and accessible active site triggers the design of porous crystalline materials with mono&#8208;layered structure for advanced photo&#8208;catalysis applications. Here, a kind of sub&#8208;nanometer mono&#8208;layered nanosheets (Co&#8208;MOF MNSs) through the exfoliation of specifically designed Co3 cluster&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is reported. The sub&#8208;nanometer thickness and inherent light&#8208;sensitivity endow Co&#8208;MOF MNSs with fully exposed Janus Co3 sites that can selectively photo&#8208;reduce CO2 into formic acid under simulated flue gas. Notably, the production efficiency of formic acid by Co&#8208;MOF MNSs (0.85&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) is &#8776;13 times higher than that of the bulk counterpart (0.065&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) under a simulated flue gas atmosphere, which is the highest in reported works up to date. Theoretical calculations prove that the exposed Janus Co3 sites with simultaneously available sites possess higher activity when compared with single Co site, validating the importance of mono&#8208;layered nanosheet morphology. These results may facilitate the development of functional nanosheet materials for CO2 photo&#8208;reduction in potential flue gas treatment.

         <title>Ultrathin High&#8208;Entropy Fe&#8208;Based Spinel Oxide Nanosheets with Metalloid Band Structures for Efficient Nitrate Reduction toward Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified sol&#8211;gel method has developed to synthesize ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxide (denotes A5Fe2O4) nanosheets. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the high&#8208;Entropy A5Fe2O4 nanosheets have metalloid band structures with remarkedly enhanced performance for the electrochemical nitrate reduction toward ammonia.








Abstract
Spinel oxides with tunable chemical compositions have emerged as versatile electrocatalysts, however their performance is greatly limited by small surface area and low electron conductivity. Here, ultrathin high&#8208;entropy Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides nanosheets are rationally designed (i.e., (Co0.2Ni0.2Zn0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2)Fe2O4; denotes A5Fe2O4) in thickness of &#8776;4.3&#160;nm with large surface area and highly exposed active sites via a modified sol&#8211;gel method. Theoretic and experimental results confirm that the bandgap of A5Fe2O4 nanosheets is significantly smaller than that of ordinary Fe&#8208;based spinel oxides, realizing the transformation of binary spinel oxide from semiconductors to metalloids. As a result, such A5Fe2O4 nanosheets manifest excellent performance for the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8722;RR) to ammonia (NH3), with a NH3 yield rate of &#8776;2.1&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V versus Reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming other spinel&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Systematic mechanism investigations reveal that the NO3&#8722;RR is mainly occurred on Fe sites, and introducing high&#8208;entropy compositions in tetrahedral sites regulates the adsorption strength of N and O&#8208;related intermediates on Fe for boosting the NO3&#8722;RR. The above findings offer a high&#8208;entropy platform to regulate the bandgap and enhance the electrocatalytic performance of spinel oxides.

         <title>Unraveling Paradoxical Effects of Large Current Density on Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The paradox between oriented Zn deposition and poor cell lifetime during large current operation is revealed to be relevant with the multiplied current density in the separator channels. Furthermore, this phenomenon is described as the separator permeation effect, which explains the rapid short circuit despite smooth Zn deposition.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBs) have been widely investigated owing to their intrinsic safety, low cost, and simple assembly. However, the actual behavior of Zn deposition under large current density is still a severe issue associated with obscure mechanism interpretation of ZBs under high loading. Here, differing from the conventional understanding that short circuit is induced by dendrite penetrating under large current density (10&#8211;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the separator permeation effect is unraveled to illustrate the paradox between smooth deposition and short lifespan. Generally, a dense plating morphology is achieved under large current density because of intensive nuclei and boosted plane growth. Nevertheless, in the scenes applying separators, the multiplied local current density derived from narrow separator channels leads to rapid Zn2+ exhaustion, converting the Zn deposition mode from nucleation control to concentration control, which eventually results in separator permeation and short circuit. This effect is validated in other aqueous metal anodes (Cu, Sn, Fe) and receives similar results. Based on the understanding, a micro&#8208;pore (150&#160;&#181;m) sponge foam is proposed as separators for large&#8208;current anodes to provide broader Zn2+ path and mitigate the separator permeation effect. This work provides unique perspectives on coordinating fast&#8208;charging ability and anode stability of ZBs.

         <title>Reverse Atom Capture on Perovskite Surface Enabling Robust and Efficient Cathode for Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced reverse atom capture technique is developed to capture surface segregated Ba and Sr cations from PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) perovskite, resulting in a unique (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructured cathode for protonic ceramic fuel cells. The single cell using such heterostructured cathode delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and a robust durability for 240&#160;h.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) hold potential for sustainable energy conversion, yet their widespread application is hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior stability of cathode materials. Here, a facile and efficient reverse atom capture technique is developed to manipulate the surface chemistry of PrBa0.5Sr0.5Co1.5Fe0.5O5+&#948; (PBSCF) cathode for PCFCs. This method successfully captures segregated Ba and Sr cations on the PBSCF surface using W species, creating a (Ba/Sr)(Co/Fe/W)O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCFW)@PBSCF heterostructure. Benefiting from enhanced kinetics of proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction and strengthened chemical stability, the single cell using the optimized 2W&#8208;PBSCF cathode demonstrates an exceptional peak power density of 1.32&#160;W cm&#8722;2 at 650&#160;&#176;C and maintains durable performance for 240&#160;h. Theoretical calculations unveil that the BSCFW perovskite delivers lower oxygen vacancy formation energy, hydration energy, and proton transfer energy compared to the PBSCF perovskite. This protocol offers new insights into advanced atom capture techniques for sustainable energy infrastructures.

Abstract
The lignin derived ultrathin all&#8208;solid composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with a thickness of only 13.2&#160;&#181;m, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single&#8208;ion lignin&#8208;based lithium salt (L&#8208;Li) and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF&#8208;HFP) as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) as the filler, is obtained through electrospinning/spraying and hot&#8208;pressing. t. The Li&#8208;symmetric cell assembled with the CPE can stably cycle more than 6000&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with little Li dendrites growth. Moreover, the assembled Li||CPE||LiFePO4 cells can stably cycle over 700 cycles at 0.2 C with a super high initial discharge capacity of 158.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at room temperature, and a favorable capacity of 123 mAh g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C for 250 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the reason that the nanofiber ionic bridge network can afford uniformly dispersed single&#8208;ion L&#8208;Li through electrospinning, which synergizes with the LiTFSI well dispersed in PEO to form abundant and efficient 3D Li+ transfer channels. The ultrathin CPE induces uniform deposition of Li+ at the interface, and effectively inhibit the lithium dendrites. This work provides a promising strategy to achieve ultrathin biobased electrolytes for solid&#8208;state lithium ion batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The lignin derived ultrathin all-solid composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) with a thickness of only 13.2&#160;&#181;m, which possess 3D nanofiber ionic bridge networks composed of single-ion lignin-based lithium salt (L-Li) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) as the framework, and poly(ethylene oxide)/lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (PEO/LiTFSI) as the filler, is obtained through electrospinning/spraying and hot-pressing. t. The Li-symmetric cell assembled with the CPE can stably cycle more than 6000&#160;h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with little Li dendrites growth. Moreover, the assembled Li||CPE||LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cells can stably cycle over 700 cycles at 0.2 C with a super high initial discharge capacity of 158.5 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature, and a favorable capacity of 123 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C for 250 cycles. The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly attributed to the reason that the nanofiber ionic bridge network can afford uniformly dispersed single-ion L-Li through electrospinning, which synergizes with the LiTFSI well dispersed in PEO to form abundant and efficient 3D Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transfer channels. The ultrathin CPE induces uniform deposition of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; at the interface, and effectively inhibit the lithium dendrites. This work provides a promising strategy to achieve ultrathin biobased electrolytes for solid-state lithium ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Polymerization Facilitating Practical High&#8208;Safety Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining the high&#8208;safety liquid electrolyte with in situ polymerization, the safety of quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries is significantly enhanced. The in&#8208;depth investigation demonstrates that the thermally stable polymer skeleton covering the electrodes impedes various exothermic reactions at elevated temperatures, promoting the self&#8208;heating temperature (T1) and onset temperature (T2), and reducing the temperature rise rate (dT dt&#8722;1) during battery thermal runaway process.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (QSSBs) are gaining widespread attention as a promising solution to improve battery safety performance. However, the safety improvement and the underlying mechanisms of QSSBs remain elusive. Herein, a novel strategy combining high&#8208;safety ethylene carbonate&#8208;free liquid electrolyte and in situ polymerization technique is proposed to prepare practical QSSBs. The Ah&#8208;level QSSBs with LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 cathode and graphite&#8211;silicon anode demonstrate significantly improved safety features without sacrificing electrochemical performance. As evidenced by accelerating rate calorimetry tests, the QSSBs exhibit increased self&#8208;heating temperature and onset temperature (T2), and decreased temperature rise rate during thermal runaway (TR). The T2 has a maximum increase of 48.4&#160;&#176;C compared to the conventional liquid batteries. Moreover, the QSSBs do not undergo TR until 180&#160;&#176;C (even 200&#160;&#176;C) during the hot&#8208;box tests, presenting significant improvement compared to the liquid batteries that run into TR at 130&#160;&#176;C. Systematic investigations show that the in situ formed polymer skeleton effectively mitigates the exothermic reactions between lithium salts and lithiated anode, retards the oxygen release from cathode, and inhibits crosstalk reactions between cathode and anode at elevated temperatures. The findings offer an innovative solution for practical high&#8208;safety QSSBs and open up a new sight for building safer high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Super&#8208;Ionic Conductor Soft Filler Promotes Li+ Transport in Integrated Cathode&#8211;Electrolyte for Solid&#8208;State Battery at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on dipole interaction between super&#8208;ionic conductive soft filler (Li+ conductivity nanocellulose, Li&#8208;NC) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), a tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) is constructed. The anchoring effect of Li&#8208;NC prevents local concentration polarization in TDCT. An integrated electrode design effectively enhances the Li+ transport at the cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Composite polymer solid electrolytes (CPEs), possessing good rigid flexible, are expected to be used in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. The integration of fillers into polymer matrices emerges as a dominant strategy to improve Li+ transport and form a Li+&#8208;conducting electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface. However, challenges arise as traditional fillers: 1) inorganic fillers, characterized by high interfacial energy, induce agglomeration; 2) organic fillers, with elevated crystallinity, impede intrinsic ionic conductivity, both severely hindering Li+ migration. Here, a concept of super&#8208;ionic conductor soft filler, utilizing a Li+ conductivity nanocellulose (Li&#8208;NC) as a model, is introduced which exhibits super&#8208;ionic conductivity. Li&#8208;NC anchors anions, and enhances Li+ transport speed, and assists in the integration of cathode&#8211;electrolyte electrodes for room temperature solid&#8208;state batteries. The tough dual&#8208;channel Li+ transport electrolyte (TDCT) with Li&#8208;NC and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) demonstrates a high Li+ transfer number (0.79) due to the synergistic coordination mechanism in Li+ transport. Integrated electrodes&#8217; design enables stable performance in LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2|Li cells, with 720&#160;cycles at 0.5 C, and 88.8% capacity retention. Furthermore, the lifespan of Li|TDCT|Li cells over 4000&#160;h and Li&#8208;rich Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2|Li cells exhibits excellent performance, proving the practical application potential of soft filler for high energy density solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries at room temperature.

Glucan Materials Synthesized by Biocatalysis
Bottom&#8208;up enzymatically synthesized glucans are promising biomaterials of tunable structure and properties. In article number 2400436 by Chao Zhong and Bernd Nidetzky, they are reviewed with particular focus on the enzymes used in the polymerization reactions. Bottom&#8208;up approaches offer interesting opportunities of the preparation of hydrogels, fibers, supramolecular hybrids, non&#8208;natural glycans, and co&#8208;polymers. These resultant polymeric materials exhibit promise for applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and coating, emphasizing the important role of biocatalysis in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials.

Smart Contact Lenses
In article number 2313848, the groups around Ar&#225;nzazu del Campo and Christoph Wittmann present a new design concept for long&#8208;term, self&#8208;lubricating hydrogels based on embedded self&#8208;replenishable reservoirs that can autonomously produce and release a lubricating agent. The reservoirs are living biofactories programmed to produce and release hyaluronic acid. The release is passively regulated by the composition and crosslinking of the hydrogel network. The living hydrogel can be processed as a CL laboratory prototype with durable&#8208;by&#8208;design wetting and lubrication.

Vertically&#8208;Aligned Graphene Micro Helices
In article number 2401451, Jeong&#8208;Hyun Cho and co&#8208;workers introduce a dual&#8208;component self&#8208;assembly method that facilitates the creation of vertically&#8208;aligned monolayer graphene micro helices with heights in the millimeter range. The vertically aligned graphene helices enhance light interactions beyond what is achievable with chiral graphene realized by conventional 2D plane methods, resulting in greatly enhanced optical chiral properties.

Drug Delivery
In article number 2311283, Hee&#8208;Seung Lee, Sangyong Jon, and co&#8208;workers have develop an organ&#8208;selective drug delivery platform based on a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles (GlyNPs). Direct in vivo library screening enable identification of GlyNP hits targeting liver, spleen, lung, kidneys, heart, and brain and, moreover, each organ&#8208;selective GlyNP hit shows cellular tropism within the organ. When liver&#8208;, kidney&#8208;, and spleen&#8208;selective GlyNP hits are equipped with therapeutics, the formulations effectively alleviated symptoms in organ&#8208;associated disease models.

         <title>Advances in Cell&#8208;Rich Inks for Biofabricating Living Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biofabrication of biomimetic architectures leveraging on cell&#8208;rich living inks matching human tissue cellular densities can lead to unprecedented advances in generating architectures with life&#8208;like features and biofunctionalities, thus moving far beyond conventional biofabricated constructs where biomaterial&#8208;to&#8208;cell ratios remain nonphysiologic. This review showcases recent advances in the design of cell&#8208;rich inks and discusses key challenges toward translation to mainstream clinical applications.








Abstract
Advancing biofabrication toward manufacturing living constructs with well&#8208;defined architectures and increasingly biologically relevant cell densities is highly desired to mimic the biofunctionality of native human tissues. The formulation of tissue&#8208;like, cell&#8208;dense inks for biofabrication remains, however, challenging at various levels of the bioprinting process. Promising advances have been made toward this goal, achieving relatively high cell densities that surpass those found in conventional platforms, pushing the current boundaries closer to achieving tissue&#8208;like cell densities. On this focus, herein the overarching challenges in the bioprocessing of cell&#8208;rich living inks into clinically grade engineered tissues are discussed, as well as the most recent advances in cell&#8208;rich living ink formulations and their processing technologies are highlighted. Additionally, an overview of the foreseen developments in the field is provided and critically discussed.

         <title>Engineering Triple&#8208;Phase Interfaces around the Anode toward Practical Alkali Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. In contrast to most previous efforts devoted to developing advanced air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity, here the significance of addressing the challenge facing the complex triple&#8208;phase interface around the anodes from the perspective of materials system engineering is highlighted.








Abstract
Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts are devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, this critical review shows the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating electrolytes to build protective interphases, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering are highlighted, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Pore Engineering of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework&#8208;Based Materials for Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of metal&#8211;organic frameworks&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis is reviewed. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with the optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives during the electrocatalytic applications is emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering.








Abstract
Ordered pore engineering that embeds uniform pores with periodic alignment in electrocatalysts opens up a new avenue for achieving further performance promotion. Hierarchically ordered porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (HOP&#8208;MOFs) possessing multilevel pores with ordered distribution are the promising precursors for the exploration of ordered porous electrocatalysts, while the scalable acquisition of HOP&#8208;MOFs with editable components and adjustable pore size regimes is critical. This review presents recent progress on hierarchically ordered pore engineering of MOF&#8208;based materials for enhanced electrocatalysis. The synthetic strategies of HOP&#8208;MOFs with different pore size regimes, including the self&#8208;assembly guided by reticular chemistry, surfactant, nanoemulsion, and nanocasting, are first introduced. Then the applications of HOP&#8208;MOFs as the precursors for exploring hierarchically ordered porous electrocatalysts are summarized, selecting representatives to highlight the boosted performance. Especially, the intensification of molecule and ion transport integrated with optimized electron transfer and site exposure over the hierarchically ordered porous derivatives are emphasized to clarify the directional transfer and integration effect endowed by ordered pore engineering. Finally, the remaining scientific challenges and an outlook of this field are proposed. It is hoped that this review will guide the hierarchically ordered pore engineering of nanocatalysts for boosting the catalytic performance and promoting the practical applications.

         <title>Remote Control of Energy Transformation&#8208;Based Cancer Imaging and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article focuses on a detailed summary of the energy transformation remote control strategy design for efficient cancer targeting long&#8208;term imaging and therapy, thereby expanding the remote control energy transformation window. By reviewing current research progress, this review paves the way for remote control applications of energy transformation&#8208;based cancer imaging and therapy.








Abstract
Cancer treatment requires precise tumor&#8208;specific targeting at specific sites that allows for high&#8208;resolution diagnostic imaging and long&#8208;term patient&#8208;tailorable cancer therapy; while, minimizing side effects largely arising from non&#8208;targetability. This can be realized by harnessing exogenous remote stimuli, such as tissue&#8208;penetrative ultrasound, magnetic field, light, and radiation, that enable local activation for cancer imaging and therapy in deep tumors. A myriad of nanomedicines can be efficiently activated when the energy of such remote stimuli can be transformed into another type of energy. This review discusses the remote control of energy transformation for targetable, efficient, and long&#8208;term cancer imaging and therapy. Such ultrasonic, magnetic, photonic, radiative, and radioactive energy can be transformed into mechanical, thermal, chemical, and radiative energy to enable a variety of cancer imaging and treatment modalities. The current review article describes multimodal energy transformation where a serial cascade or multiple types of energy transformation occur. This review includes not only mechanical, chemical, hyperthermia, and radiation therapy but also emerging thermoelectric, pyroelectric, and piezoelectric therapies for cancer treatment. It also illustrates ultrasound, magnetic resonance, fluorescence, computed tomography, photoluminescence, and photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapies. It highlights afterglow imaging that can eliminate autofluorescence for sustained signal emission after the excitation.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Synthesized Glucan Materials: Opportunities from Applied Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 27, July 4, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Linear d&#8208;glucans, simple yet versatile polysaccharides, shape nanostructures crucial for biomaterial development. Shifting from top&#8208;down to bottom&#8208;up synthesis using natural and engineered enzymes provides meticulous control over polymer structures, fostering diversification for macromolecular materials. This review introduces advancements in non&#8208;natural glucans, copolymers, and supramolecular hybrids, obtained through bottom&#8208;up enzymatic approaches. It emphasizes the potential of enzyme biocatalysis in material development.








Abstract
Linear d&#8208;glucans are natural polysaccharides of simple chemical structure. They are comprised of d&#8208;glucosyl units linked by a single type of glycosidic bond. Noncovalent interactions within, and between, the d&#8208;glucan chains give rise to a broad variety of macromolecular nanostructures that can assemble into crystalline&#8208;organized materials of tunable morphology. Structure design and functionalization of d&#8208;glucans for diverse material applications largely relies on top&#8208;down processing and chemical derivatization of naturally derived starting materials. The top&#8208;down approach encounters critical limitations in efficiency, selectivity, and flexibility. Bottom&#8208;up approaches of d&#8208;glucan synthesis offer different, and often more precise, ways of polymer structure control and provide means of functional diversification widely inaccessible to top&#8208;down routes of polysaccharide material processing. Here the natural and engineered enzymes (glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases and phosphorylases, glycosynthases) for d&#8208;glucan polymerization are described and the use of applied biocatalysis for the bottom&#8208;up assembly of specific d&#8208;glucan structures is shown. Advanced material applications of the resulting polymeric products are further shown and their important role in the development of sustainable macromolecular materials in a bio&#8208;based circular economy is discussed.

         <title>Chirality&#8208;Induced Spin Selectivity Enables New Breakthrough in Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The spin&#8208;polarization approach enhances spin&#8208;dependent electrochemical (EC) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) redox reactions by utilizing the chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon. This perspective provides the promising potential of CISS&#8208;driven EC and PEC systems involving various redox reactions, anticipating significant advancements in renewable energy conversion and storage.








Abstract
To facilitate the transition from a carbon&#8208;energy&#8208;dependent society to a sustainable society, conventional engineering strategies, which encounter limitations associated with intrinsic material properties, should undergo the paradigm shift. From a theoretical viewpoint, the spin&#8208;dependent feature of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reveals the potential of a spin&#8208;polarization strategy in enhancing the performance of electrochemical (EC) reactions. The chirality&#8208;induced spin selectivity (CISS) phenomenon attracts unprecedented attention owing to its potential utility in achieving novel breakthroughs. This paper starts with the experimental results aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the spin&#8208;dependent OER focusing on the EC system based on the CISS phenomenon. The applicability of spin&#8208;polarization to EC system is verified through various analytical methodologies to clarify the theoretical groundwork and mechanisms underlying the spin&#8208;dependent reaction pathway. The discussion is then extended to effective spin&#8208;control strategies in photoelectrochemical system based on the CISS effect. Exploring the influence of spin&#8208;state control on the kinetic and thermodynamic aspects, this perspective also discusses the effect of spin polarization induced by the CISS phenomenon on spin&#8208;dependent OER. Lastly, future directions for enhancing the performance of spin&#8208;dependent redox systems are discussed, including expansion to various chemical reactions and the development of materials with spin&#8208;control capabilities.

         <title>Reversible Solar Heating and Radiative Cooling Devices via Mechanically Guided Assembly of 3D Macro/Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices employing mechanically guided 3D architectures demonstrate dual&#8208;mode actuation with uniaxial strain. These devices, which are applicable on macro/microscales, utilize optimized 3D platforms that accommodate both rigid and soft materials. Heating/cooling layers achieve heating/cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. The fabricated devices exhibit effective heating/cooling on diverse surfaces.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling are promising solutions for decreasing global energy consumption because these strategies use the Sun (&#8776;5800&#160;K) as a heating source and outer space (&#8776;3&#160;K) as a cooling source. Although high&#8208;performance thermal management can be achieved using these eco&#8208;friendly methods, they are limited by daily temperature fluctuations and seasonal changes because of single&#8208;mode actuation. Herein, reversible solar heating and radiative cooling devices formed via the mechanically guided assembly of 3D architectures are demonstrated. The fabricated devices exhibit the following properties: i) The devices reversibly change between solar heating and radiative cooling under uniaxial strain, called dual&#8208;mode actuation. ii) The 3D platforms in the devices can use rigid/soft materials for functional layers owing to the optimized designs. iii) The devices can be used for dual&#8208;mode thermal management on a macro/microscale. The devices use black paint&#8208;coated polyimide (PI) films as solar absorbers with multilayered films comprising thin layers of polydimethylsiloxane/silver/PI, achieving heating and cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Moreover, mode changes according to the angle of the 3D structures are demonstrated and the heating/cooling performance with skin, glass, steel, aluminum, copper, and PI substrates is investigated.

The fabricated devices exhibit the following properties: i) The devices reversibly change between solar heating and radiative cooling under uniaxial strain, called dual-mode actuation. ii) The 3D platforms in the devices can use rigid/soft materials for functional layers owing to the optimized designs. iii) The devices can be used for dual-mode thermal management on a macro/microscale. The devices use black paint-coated polyimide (PI) films as solar absorbers with multilayered films comprising thin layers of polydimethylsiloxane/silver/PI, achieving heating and cooling temperatures of 59.5 and &#8722;11.9&#160;&#176;C, respectively. Moreover, mode changes according to the angle of the 3D structures are demonstrated and the heating/cooling performance with skin, glass, steel, aluminum, copper, and PI substrates is investigated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Colloidal Quantum Dots: Progress and Opportunities in Solar Technologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) show potential in solar technologies due to their photostability and adjustable properties. However, high&#8208;performing QDs often contain hazardous metals like Cd and Pb. Heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs are reviewed for solar applications, analyzing synthetic strategies to optimize optical properties and improve charge dynamics. Structure&#8208;property relationships and future challenges like machine learning&#8208;based design and sustainable synthesis are also discussed.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) hold great promise as building blocks in solar technologies owing to their remarkable photostability and adjustable properties through the rationale involving size, atomic composition of core and shell, shapes, and surface states. However, most high&#8208;performing QDs in solar conversion contain hazardous metal elements, including Cd and Pb, posing significant environmental risks. Here, a comprehensive review of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free colloidal QDs for solar technologies, including photovoltaic (PV) devices, solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical fuel conversion, and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs), is presented. Emerging synthetic strategies to optimize the optical properties by tuning the energy band structure and manipulating charge dynamics within the QDs and at the QDs/charge acceptors interfaces, are analyzed. A comparative analysis of different synthetic methods is provided, structure&#8208;property relationships in these materials are discussed, and they are correlated with the performance of solar devices. This work is concluded with an outlook on challenges and opportunities for future work, including machine learning&#8208;based design, sustainable synthesis, and new surface/interface engineering.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Photocatalytic Reactivity of Conjugated Microporous Polymer Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Decreasing the size of conjugated microporous polymer (CMP) nanoparticles is proposed to overcome diffusional resistance of substrates in the porous polymer photocatalysts and improve energy efficiency of photocatalytic reactions. Smaller CMP nanoparticles show higher photocatalytic reactivity, achieving more than 1000% enhancement in the photocatalytic reaction rates by decreasing the particle size.








Abstract
Particle size is a critical factor for improving photocatalytic reactivity of conjugated microporous polymers (CMPs) as mass transfer in the porous materials is often the rate&#8208;limiting step. However, due to the synthetic challenge of controlling the size of CMPs, the impact of particle size is yet to be investigated. To address this problem, a simple and versatile dispersion polymerization route that can synthesize dispersible CMP nanoparticles with controlled size from 15 to 180&#160;nm is proposed. Leveraging the precise control of the size, it is demonstrated that smaller CMP nanoparticles have dramatically higher photocatalytic reactivity in various organic transformations, achieving more than 1000% enhancement in the reaction rates by decreasing the size from 180 to 15&#160;nm. The size&#8208;dependent photocatalytic reactivity is further scrutinized using a kinetic model and transient absorption spectroscopy, revealing that only the initial 5&#160;nm&#8208;thick surface layer of CMP nanoparticles is involved in the photocatalytic reactions because of internal mass transfer limitations. This finding substantiates the potential of small CMP nanoparticles to efficiently use photo&#8208;generated excitons and improve energy&#8208;efficiency of numerous photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Charged Black&#8208;Hole&#8208;Like Electronic Structure Driven by Geometric Potential of 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is found that curvature in 2D semiconductors triggers the modified geometric potential with curvature&#8208;induced bandgap change, resembling the effective potential of black holes. The atomic&#8208;scale observation of bound states in the modified geometric potential shows an analog of the stable orbits near black holes. The modified geometric potential is related to curvature&#8208;induced variations in both band gap and spin&#8208;orbit interaction.








Abstract
One of the exotic expectations in the 2D curved spacetime is the geometric potential from the curvature of the 2D space, still possessing unsolved fundamental questions through Dirac quantization. The atomically thin 2D materials are promising for the realization of the geometric potential, but the geometric potential in 2D materials is not identified experimentally. Here, the curvature&#8208;induced ring&#8208;patterned bound states are observed in structurally deformed 2D semiconductors and formulated the modified geometric potential for the curvature effect, which demonstrates the ring&#8208;shape bound states with angular momentum. The formulated modified geometric potential is analogous to the effective potential of a rotating charged black hole. Density functional theory and tight&#8208;binding calculations are performed, which quantitatively agree well with the results of the modified geometric potential. The modified geometric potential is described by modified Gaussian and mean curvatures, corresponding to the curvature&#8208;induced changes in spin&#8208;orbit interaction and band gap, respectively. Even for complex structural deformation, the geometric potential solves the complexity, which aligns well with experimental results. The understanding of the modified geometric potential provides us with an intuitive clue for quantum transport and a key factor for new quantum applications such as valleytronics, spintronics, and straintronics in 2D semiconductors.

Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices offer a promising platform towards direct solar light harvesting and chemical storage. However, most prototypes employ wide bandgap semiconductors, moisture&#8208;sensitive inorganic light absorbers, or corrosive electrolytes. Here, we introduce the design and assembly of PEC devices based on an organic donor&#8208;acceptor bulk heterojunction (BHJ), which demonstrate long&#8208;term H2 evolution and CO2 reduction in benign aqueous media using a carbon&#8208;based encapsulant. Accordingly, PCE10:EH&#8208;IDTBR photocathodes display long&#8208;term H2 production for 300&#160;h in a near&#8208;neutral pH solution, whereas photocathodes with a molecular CO2 reduction catalyst attain a CO:H2 selectivity of 5.41&#177;0.53 under 0.1 sun irradiation. Their early onset potentials enable the construction of PCE10:EH&#8208;IDTBR &#8211; BiVO4 artificial leaves, which couple unassisted syngas production with O2 evolution in a reactor completely powered by sunlight, sustaining a 1:1 ratio of CO to H2 over 96&#160;h of operation.

Abstract
High&#8208;quality imaging units are indispensable in modern&#160;optoelectronic systems for accurate recognition and processing of optical information. To fulfill massive and complex imaging tasks in&#160;digital age, devices with remarkable photoresponsive characteristics and versatile reconfigurable functions on a single device platform are&#160;in demand but remain challenging to fabricate. We report an AlGaN/GaN&#8208;based double&#8208;heterostructure, incorporated with a unique compositionally graded AlGaN structure to generate a channel of polarization&#8208;induced two&#8208;dimensional electrons that can be modulated to control electron separation, collection, and storage process in the channel of the fabricated phototransistor. As a result, when exposed to different light sources, the device shows reconfigurable multifunctional photoresponsive behaviors with superior characteristics owing to the successful programming of the 2DEGs by the combined gate and drain voltage inputs. A self&#8208;powered mode with a responsivity over 100 A/W and a photoconductive mode with a responsivity of &#8764;108&#160;A/W were achieved, with the ultimate demonstration of a 10&#215;10 device array for imaging. More intriguingly, the device can be switched to photoelectric synapse mode, emulating synaptic functions to denoise the imaging process while prolonging the image storage capability. Demonstrating three&#8208;in&#8208;one operational characteristics in a single device offers a new path toward future integrated and multifunctional imaging units.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high Performance Thermochromic Polymers via a Solid&#8208;solid Phase Transition Mechanism and Their Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermochromic materials are substances that change colour in response to temperature variations. Today, sustainability concerns are the main drivers of thermochromic research, with smart, energy efficient windows being one of primary applications. While vanadium oxides and leuco dyes are traditionally the main thermochromic materials, hydrogels operating based on change of solvation have risen as some of the most promising materials due to their high optical transparency and good solar modulating abilities. In this work, a distinct mechanism for thermochromism arising from the crystalline solid to amorphous solid polymer transition, with a corresponding transition from an opaque state to a transparent state is disclosed. Both ultra&#8208;high optical transparency (Tlum up to 99%) and ultra&#8208;high solar modulation (&#916;Tsolar up to 87%) were observed. The transition temperature was tunable from 11 to 61 &#870; C by tuning the polymer structure. When incorporated into applications such as greenhouse materials and thermoelectric devices, significant performance enhancement was observed, due to the thermochromic material functioning as a thermal valve, speeding up solar heat absorbance while inhibiting the cooling process via its phase transition.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. Here, we controlled TCR clustering via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibited higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. Our approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provide the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;Broadband Sunlight&#8208;Like Emission in Single&#8208;Phase Phosphors: The Interplay of Structure and Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quest for artificial light sources that mimic sunlight's spectral characteristics has been a long&#8208;standing endeavor, particularly for applications in anticounterfeiting, agriculture, and color hue detection. Conventional sunlight simulators, such as xenon lamps, are often cost&#8208;prohibitive and bulky, limiting their adoption. In this regard, the development of a series of single&#8208;phase phosphors Ca9LiMg1&#8208;xAl2x/3(PO4)7:0.1Eu2+ (x = 0&#8208;0.75) with sunlight&#8208;like emission described in this work holds immense promise as a compact and economical light source alternative. The phosphors have been obtained by an original heterovalent substitution method and emit a broad spectrum that encompasses the entire visible region, spanning from violet to deep red. Notably, the phosphor with x = 0.5 exhibits an impressive full width at half maximum of 330&#160;nm. A synergistic interplay of experimental investigations and density&#8208;functional theory calculations unveils the underlying mechanism behind sunlight&#8208;like emission. It is attributed to the local structural perturbations introduced by the heterovalent substitution of Al3+ for Mg2+, leading to a varied distribution of Eu2+ within the lattice. Subsequent characterization of a series of organic dyes combining absorption spectroscopy with convolutional neural network analysis convincingly demonstrates the potential of this phosphor in portable photodetection devices. Broad&#8208;spectrum light source testing empowers our model to precisely differentiate dye patterns. This points to the phosphor being ideal for mimicking sunlight. And beyond this demonstrated application, we envision the phosphor's utility in other relevant domains, including visible light communication and smart agriculture. These findings not only enrich our understanding of luminescent materials design but also pave the way for advancements in various application areas.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) was synthesized via a spatial confinement growth strategy. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibited superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of the atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs was favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reached nearly 100% in a range of 0.2 &#8764; 0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieved 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, which exceeded most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 was converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promoted the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the in&#8208;situ generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Piezoelectric Biomaterials Inspired by Nature for Applications in Biomedicine and Nanotechnology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Bioelectricity provides electrostimulation to regulate cell/tissue behaviors and functions. In the human body, bioelectricity can be generated in electromechanically responsive tissues and organs, as well as biomolecular building blocks that exhibit piezoelectricity, with a phenomenon known as the piezoelectric effect. Inspired by natural bio&#8208;piezoelectric phenomenon, efforts have been devoted to exploiting high&#8208;performance synthetic piezoelectric biomaterials, including molecular materials, polymeric materials, ceramic materials, and composite materials. Notably, piezoelectric biomaterials polarize under mechanical strain and generate electrical potentials, which can be used to fabricate electronic devices. Herein, we propose a review article to summarize the design and research progress of piezoelectric biomaterials and devices toward bionanotechnology. We first introduce the functions of bioelectricity in regulating human electrophysiological activity from cellular to tissue level. Next, recent advances as well as structure&#8208;property relationship of various natural and synthetic piezoelectric biomaterials are provided in detail. In the following part, we systematically classify and discuss the applications of piezoelectric biomaterials in tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensing, energy harvesting, and catalysis. Finally, the challenges and future prospects of piezoelectric biomaterials are presented. We believe that this review will provide inspiration for the design and development of innovative piezoelectric biomaterials in the fields of biomedicine and nanotechnology.

         <title>Sodiophilic Substrate Induces NaF&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Anode</title>

Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) substrate with abundant sodiophilic active sites holds promise for implementing dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anodes and high&#8208;performance sodium batteries. However, the heightened electrode/electrolyte side reactions stemming from high specific surface area still hinder electrode structure stability and cycling reversibility, particularly under high current densities. Herein, we regulated the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) component and restrained detrimental side reactions through the uniform loading of Na&#8208;Sn alloy onto a porous 3D nanofiber framework (NaSn&#8208;PCNF). The strong interaction between Na&#8208;Sn alloy and PF6&#8722; anions facilitates the dissociation of sodium salts and releases more free sodium ions for effective charge transfer. Simultaneously, the modulations of the interfacial electrolyte solvation structure and the construction of a high NaF content SEI layer stabilize the electrode/electrolyte interface. NaSn&#8208;PCNF symmetrical battery demonstrates stable cycling for over 600 hours with an ultralow overpotential of 24.5&#160;mV under harsh condition of 10&#8197;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the full cells and pouch cells exhibit accelerated reaction kinetics and splendid capacity retention, providing valuable insights into the development of advanced Na substrates for high&#8208;energy sodium metal batteries.

Abstract
In the dynamic landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI), two notable phenomena are becoming predominant: the exponential growth of large AI model sizes and the explosion of massive amount of data. Meanwhile, scientific research such as quantum computing and protein synthesis increasingly demand higher computing capacities. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the mechanism and functionality of human brains, uses physical artificial neurons to do computations and is drawing widespread attention. Conventional electronic computing has experienced certain difficulties, particularly concerning the latency, crosstalk, and energy consumption of digital processors. As the Moore's law approaches its terminus, there is a urgent need for alternative computing architectures that can satisfy this growing computing demand and break through the von Neumann model. Recently, the expansion of optoelectronic devices on photonic integration platforms has led to significant growth in photonic computing, where photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have enabled ultrafast artificial neural networks (ANN) with sub&#8208;nanosecond latencies, low heat dissipation, and high parallelism. Such non&#8208;von Neumann photonic computing systems hold the promise to cater to the escalating requirements of AI and scientific computing. In this review, we&#160;study recent advancements in integrated photonic neuromorphic systems, and from the perspective of materials and device engineering, we&#160;lay out the scientific and technological breakthroughs necessary to advance the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. In particular, we&#160;examine various technologies and devices employed in neuromorphic photonic AI accelerators, spanning from traditional optics to PICs. We&#160;evaluate the performances of different designs by energy efficiency in operations per joule (OP/J) and compute density in operations per squared millimeter per second (OP/mm2/s). Putting special emphasis on photonic components such as VCSEL lasers, optical interconnects, and frequency microcombs, we&#160;highlight the most recent breakthroughs in photonic engineering and materials science used to create advanced neuromorphic computing chips. Lastly, we&#160;recognize that existing technologies encounter obstacles in achieving photonic AI accelerators with peta&#8208;level computing speed and energy efficiency, and we&#160;also explore potential approaches in new devices, fabrication, materials, and integration to drive innovation. As the current challenges and barriers in cost, scalability, footprint, and computing capacity are resolved one&#8208;by&#8208;one, photonic neuromorphic systems are bound to co&#8208;exist with, if not replace, conventional electronic computers and transform the landscape of AI and scientific computing in the foreseeable future.

         <title>Unveiling the In Situ Evolution of Li2O&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interface on CoOx Embedded Carbon Fibers as Li Anode Host</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modification of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon hosts with metal oxides has been considered as advantageous for the formation of Li2O&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI), which could show fast Li+ diffusion, and meanwhile alleviate dendrite problems caused by fragility and non&#8208;uniformity of native SEIs. However, the lack of convincing experimental evidence has made it difficult to unveil the true origin of oxygen in Li2O&#8208;rich SEIs until now. Herein, we successfully prepared CoOx embedded carbon nanofibers (CNF&#8208;CoOx) as high&#8208;performance Li anode hosts. By employing 18O isotope labeling, we aimed to elucidate the role of CoOx during SEI evolution that CoOx contributes significantly to Li2O formation by delivering oxygen. Benefiting from the rich Li2O content, the as&#8208;formed SEIs greatly improve the Li+ migration kinetics, and therefore the CNF&#8208;CoOx@Li anode could exhibit excellent cycling stability in half, symmetrical, and full cells.

         <title>Efficient Orbitronic Terahertz Emission Based on CoPt Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Orbitronic devices operate by manipulating orbitally polarized currents. Recent studies have shown that these orbital currents can be excited by femtosecond laser pulses in a ferromagnet such as Ni and converted into ultrafast charge currents via orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, the terahertz emission from orbitronic terahertz emitters based on Ni is still much weaker than that of the typical spintronic terahertz emitter. Here, we report a more efficient light&#8208;induced generation of orbital current from a CoPt alloy, and the terahertz emission from CoPt/Cu/MgO is comparable to that of benchmark spintronic terahertz emitters. By varying the composition of the CoPt alloy, the thickness of Cu, and the capping layer, we confirm that THz emission primarily originates from the orbital accumulation generated within CoPt, propagating through Cu, followed by subsequent orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion due to the inverse orbital Rashba&#8208;Edelstein effect at the Cu/MgO interface. This study provides strong evidence for the efficient orbital current generation in CoPt alloy, paving the way for efficient orbital terahertz emitters.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity towards NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here we present a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction. We achieve a high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8208;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation-driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering-designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally-obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation-driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering-designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0-3.1 MW&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering-enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high-temperature and high-heat-flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long-lasting, and large-scale solutions for thermal protection.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Interstitials in Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Defect structure is pivotal in advancing thermoelectric performance with interstitials being widely recognized for their remarkable roles in optimizing both phonon and electron transport properties. Diverse interstitial atoms have been identified in previous works according to their distinct roles and can be classified into rattling interstitial, decoupling interstitial, interlayer interstitial, dynamic interstitial and liquid interstitial. Specifically, rattling interstitial can cause phonon resonance in cage compound to scatter phonon transport; decoupling interstitial can contribute to phonon blocking and electron transport due to their significantly different mean free paths; interlayer interstitial can facilitate out&#8208;of&#8208;layer electron transport in layered compounds; dynamic interstitial can tune temperature&#8208;dependent carrier density and optimize electrical transport properties at wide temperatures; liquid interstitial could improve the carrier mobility at homogeneous dispersion state. All of these interstitials have positive impact on thermoelectric performance by adjusting transport parameters. This perspective therefore intends to provide a thorough overview of advances in interstitial strategy and highlight their significance for optimizing thermoelectric parameters. Finally, the profound potential for extending interstitial strategy to various other thermoelectric systems is discussed and some future directions in thermoelectric material are also outlined.

         <title>Band Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dot Solids for High&#8208;Performance Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) shows high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their tunable surface chemistry, good solution&#8208;processability and unique photophysical properties. However, the remained long&#8208;chain ligand attached to the PQD surface significantly impedes the charge carrier transport within the PQD solids, thereby predominantly influencing the charge extraction of PQD solar cells (PQDSCs). Herein, a ligand&#8208;induced energy level modulation is reported for band engineering of PQD solids to improve the charge extraction of PQDSCs. Detailed theoretical calculations and systemic experimental studies are performed to comprehensively understand the photophysical properties of the PQD solids dominated by the surface ligands of PQDs. The results reveal that 4&#8208;nitrobenzenethiol and 4&#8208;methoxybenzenethiol molecules with different dipole moments could firmly anchor to the PQD surface thoroughly the thiol group to modulate the energy levels of PQDs, and a gradient band structure within the PQD solid is subsequently realized. Consequently, the band&#8208;engineered PQDSC delivers an efficiency of up to 16.44%, which is one of the highest efficiencies of CsPbI3 PQDSCs. This work provides a feasible avenue for the band engineering of PQD solids by tuning the surface chemistry of PQDs for high&#8208;performing solar cells or other optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Fully Reprogrammable 2D Array of Multi&#8208;State Molecular Switching Units</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Integration of molecular switching units into complex electronic circuits is considered to be the next step towards the realization of novel logic and memory devices. Here, we&#160;report on an ordered 2D network of neighboring ternary switching units represented by triazatruxene (TAT) molecules organized in a honeycomb lattice on a Ag(111) surface. Using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we&#160;are able to control the bonding configurations of individual TAT molecules within the lattice, realizing up to 12 distinct states per molecule. The switching between those states shows a particularly strong bias dependence ranging from tens of millivolts to volts. Based on a single TAT molecule as a fundamental building block, we&#160;then explore the low&#8208;bias switching behavior in units consisting of two and more interacting TAT molecules purposefully defined by the high&#8208;bias switching within the honeycomb lattice. we&#160;demonstrate the possibility to realize up to 9 and 19 distinguishable states in a dyad and a tetrad of coupled switching units, respectively. The switching dynamics can be triggered and accessed by single&#8208;point measurements on a single molecule. High experimental control over the desired state, owing to hierarchical switching and pronounced switching directionality, as well as the observed full reversibility, makes this system particularly appealing, paving the way to design complex molecule&#8208;based memory&#160;systems.

         <title>Synchronous Switching Strategy to Enhance the Real&#8208;Time Powering and Charging Performance of Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) are of great significance as sustainable power sources that harvest energy from the human body and environment. Nevertheless, due to TENG's impedance&#8208;dependent output voltage characteristics, in traditional strategy (TS), real&#8208;timely powering a sensor with TENG has a poor sensing on/off ratio (or response), and directly charging a capacitor with TENG shows a low charging efficiency. This degraded real&#8208;time powering and charging performance of TENG compared to a commercial constant voltage source has been a huge challenge of the TENG field for a long time. Here, we propose a synchronous switching strategy (SSS) for TENG to real&#8208;timely power sensors or charge capacitors without degrading its performance. Compared with TS, this new strategy enables sensors to have 5&#8211;7 times sensing on/off ratio enhancement when using TENG as a power source, reaching the powering ability of a commercial constant voltage source, it makes the powering performance of TENG stable under different driving frequency, improving the powering robustness of TENG. In addition, compared with TS, SSS can also enhance the charging efficiency of TENG in every charging cycle by up to 2.4 times when charging capacitors. This work contributes to real&#8208;timely powering or charging the distributed, mobile and wireless electronics using TENG.

         <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Phase&#8208;Change Transmissive Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide&#8208;based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non&#8208;volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub&#8208;micron&#8208;sized.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmable and reconfigurable optics hold significant potential for transforming a broad spectrum of applications, spanning space explorations to biomedical imaging, gas sensing, and optical cloaking. The ability to adjust the optical properties of components like filters, lenses, and beam steering devices could result in dramatic reductions in size, weight, and power consumption in future optoelectronic devices. Among the potential candidates for reconfigurable optics, chalcogenide-based phase change materials (PCMs) offer great promise due to their non-volatile and analogue switching characteristics. Although PCM have found widespread use in electronic data storage, these memory devices are deeply sub-micron-sized. To incorporate phase change materials into free-space optical components, it is essential to scale them up to beyond several hundreds of microns while maintaining reliable switching characteristics. This study demonstrated a non-mechanical, non-volatile transmissive filter based on low-loss PCMs with a 200 &#181;m&#215;200 &#181;m switching area. The device/metafilter can be consistently switched between low- and high-transmission states using electrical pulses with a switching contrast ratio of 5.5 dB. The device was&#160;reversibly switched for 1250 cycles before accelerated degradation took place. The work represents an important step toward realizing free-space reconfigurable optics based on&#160;PCMs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Reorganizing Helmholtz Adsorption Plane Enables Sodium Layered&#8208;Oxide Cathode Beyond High Oxidation Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium layered&#8208;oxides (NaxTMO2) sustain severe interfacial stability issues when subjected to battery applications. Particularly at high potential, the oxidation limits including transition metal dissolution and SEI reformation are intertwined upon the cathode, resulting in poor cycle ability. Herein, by rearranging the complex and structure of Helmholtz absorption plane adjacent to NaxTMO2 cathodes, the mechanism of constructing stable cathode/electrolyte interphase to push up oxidation limits is clarified. The strong absorbent fluorinated anions replace the solvents into the inner Helmholtz plane, thereby reorganizing the Helmholtz absorption structure and spontaneously inducing an anion&#8208;dominated interphase to envelop more active sites for layered oxides. More importantly, such multi&#8208;component cathode/electrolyte interphase proves effective for long&#8208;term durability of a series of manganese&#8208;based oxide cathodes, which achieves 1500&#8208;cycles lifetime against high oxidation voltage limit beyond 4.3&#160;V. This work unravels the key role of breaking high&#8208;oxidation limits in attaining higher energy density of layered&#8208;oxide systems.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
