         <title>Hierarchical Composite Self&#8208;Sorted Supramolecular Gel Noodles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multicomponent assembly of 2NapFF with the structurally similar functionalized dipeptide 2NapLG causes changes to the formed first&#8208;order supramolecular structures. These changes to assembly allow access to new properties and behaviors. This multicomponent system can be used to form mechanically robust supramolecular noodles. Through a change in external conditions (a reduction in pH), crystals can be formed within these noodles.








Abstract
Multicomponent supramolecular systems can be used to achieve different properties and new behaviors compared to their corresponding single component systems. Here, a two&#8208;component system is used, showing that a non&#8208;gelling component modifies the assembly of the gelling component, allowing access to co&#8208;assembled structures that cannot be formed from the gelling component alone. The systems are characterized across multiple length scales, from the molecular level by NMR and CD spectroscopy to the microstructure level by SANS and finally to the material level using nanoindentation and rheology. By exploiting the enhanced mechanical properties achieved through addition of the second component, multicomponent noodles are formed with superior mechanical properties to those formed by the single&#8208;component system. Furthermore, the non&#8208;gelling component can be triggered to crystallize within the multicomponent noodles, allowing the preparation of new types of hierarchical composite noodles.

         <title>B&#63743;N&#8208;Bond&#8208;Embedded Triplet Terpolymers with Small Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Gaps for Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and Improving Blend Morphology in Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of terpolymers are developed by introducing the B&#63743;N bond into the polymer chain of PM6, which lowers the HOMO level, reduces the &#916;EST, and optimizes the morphology of the active blend, contributing to a high PCE of 19.02% with reduced Eloss and charge recombination.








Abstract
Suppressing the photon energy loss (Eloss), especially the non&#8208;radiative loss, is of importance to further improve the device performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, typical &#960;&#8208;conjugated semiconductors possess a large singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST), leading to a lower triplet state than charge transfer state and contributing to a non&#8208;radiative loss channel of the photocurrent by the triplet state. Herein, a series of triplet polymer donors are developed by introducing a BNIDT block into the PM6 polymer backbone. The high electron affinity of BNIDT and the opposite resonance effect of the B&#63743;N bond in BNIDT results in a lowered highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and a largely reduced &#916;EST. Moreover, the morphology of the active blends is also optimized by fine&#8208;tuning the BNIDT content. Therefore, non&#8208;radiative recombination via the terminal triplet loss channels and morphology traps is effectively suppressed. The PNB&#8208;3 (with 3% BNIDT):L8&#8208;BO device exhibits both small &#916;EST and optimized morphology, favoring more efficient charge transfer and transport. Finally, the simultaneously enhanced Voc of 0.907&#160;V, Jsc of 26.59&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and FF of 78.86% contribute to a champion PCE of 19.02%. Therefore, introducing B&#63743;N bonds into benchmark polymers is a possible avenue toward higher&#8208;performance of OSCs.

         <title>Band Engineering of the Second Phase to Reach High Thermoelectric Performance in Cu2Se&#8208;Based Composite Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The band energy of the second phase is proposed to diminish the electric scattering caused by nanophase incorporation. It realizes similar electronic structures and different phonon structures between the Cu2Se and dispersed nano&#8208;Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, which maintain a high power factor and suppress the thermal conductivity, resulting in a figure of merit (zT) value of 2.34 at 850 K.








Abstract
Hitherto, Cu2Se incorporated with a dispersed second phase shows extremely low thermal conductivity and excellent thermoelectric properties. However, the significant mismatch in electronic band structure between the second phases and the matrix often causes a deterioration of carrier mobility. In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the electronic band structure of the second phase is adjusted through doping S and Te. It is found that Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 has a highly similar electronic band structure to the Cu2Se matrix, which results in high carrier mobility and power factor in Cu2Se&#8208;based composite materials. Additionally, the dispersed second&#8208;phase Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06, dislocations, and nanograins are observed in the Cu2Se/5 wt% Cu2Se0.88S0.06Te0.06 product, which leads to a substantial reduction in the thermal conductivity. Finally, high figure of merit (zT) values of 2.04 (by Dulong&#8211;Petit heat capacity) and 2.34 (by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measured heat capacity) are achieved at 850 K, which are about 65% higher than that of Cu2Se in this work and comparable to the recently reported p&#8208;type Cu2Se with outstanding performance.

         <title>Efficient Nanoscale Exciton Transport in Non&#8208;fullerene Organic Solar Cells Enables Reduced Bimolecular Recombination of Free Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The highest efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV)&#8208;based solar cells, made from blends of electron donating and accepting organic semiconductors, are often characterized by strongly reduced (non&#8208;Langevin) bimolecular recombination. Although the origins of the reduced recombination are debated, mechanisms related to the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and free&#8208;carrier encounter dynamics controlled by the size of donor and acceptor domains have been proposed as underlying factors. In this communication we report a novel photoluminescence&#8208;based probe to accurately quantify the donor&#8208;acceptor domain size in OPV blends. Specifically, we measure the domain size in high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene (NFA) acceptor systems and compare them to a conventional fullerene. We find that the NFA&#8208;based blends form larger domains but that the expected reductions in bi&#8208;molecular recombination attributed to the enhanced domain sizes are too small to account for the observed reduction factors. Further, we show that the reduction of bimolecular recombination is correlated to enhanced exciton dynamics within the NFA domains. This indicates that the processes responsible for efficient exciton transport also enable strongly non&#8208;Langevin recombination in high efficiency NFA&#8208;based solar cells with low energy offsets.

Abstract
Hydrogels have entered the spotlight for applications in soft electronic devices and machines. It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, i.e., 30%&#8211;90% relative humidity (RH) and &#8722;20&#8211;40&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;(2&#8208;methylprop&#8208;2&#8208;enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compare to the commonly&#8208;used glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30%&#8211;90% RH. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non&#8208;leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&#8722;1), wide humidity and temperature applicability. A wide&#8208;humidity healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag@poly(DMAPS) paste. Integrating the high&#8208;performance electrode and dielectric layer, a full&#8208;device healable and highly&#8208;sensitive sensor is developed. This study is a pioneering work that tackles the broad humidity applicability issue of hydrogel materials, and demonstrates the ion&#8208;leakage&#8208;free ionic skins with zwitterionic dielectrics. We believe, the outcomes of the study will considerably promote advancements in the fields of hydrogel electronics and iontronic sensors.

It is essential and challenging to obtain hydrogels that can function properly under varying environmental circumstances, i.e., 30%&#8211;90% relative humidity (&lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;) and &#8722;20&#8211;40&#176;C due to their intrinsic nature to lose and absorb water upon variations in humidity and temperature. In this work, a green solvent, solketal, is introduced into poly 3-dimethyl-2-(2-methylprop-2-enoyloxy)ethyl azaniumyl propane-1-sulfonate (poly(DMAPS)) zwitterionic hydrogels. Compare to the commonly-used glycerol, solketal endows hydrogels with greater possibility for further modification as well as improved water content and mechanical performance consistency over 30%&#8211;90% &lt;i&gt;RH&lt;/i&gt;. Encouragingly, the optimized hydrogel demonstrates its unique merits as a dielectric layer in iontronic sensors, featuring non-leaky ions, high sensitivity (1100 kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), wide humidity and temperature applicability. A wide-humidity healable and stretchable electrode is attained by combining the hydrogel substrate with Ag@poly(DMAPS) paste.

         <title>Repeatedly Recyclable 3D Printing Catalyst&#8208;free Dynamic Thermosetting Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology has promoted the advanced manufacturing in various fields, but has exacerbated the environmental crisis by the demand for the chemically cross&#8208;linked thermosetting photopolymers. Here, we report a generic strategy to develop catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers, based on photopolymerization and transesterification, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing, providing a practical solution to the environmental challenges. We demonstrate that the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group adjacent to the ester group greatly accelerates the rate of transesterification. The generated resins from the immobilization of the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers leads to a dynamic covalently crosslinked network structure upon UV based 3D printing, which exhibit controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network can be reverted into an acrylate&#8208;functioned photopolymer that is suitable for 3D printing again, presenting an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.

         <title>Pyroptosis&#8208;Mediated Synergistic Photodynamic and Photothermal Immunotherapy Enabled by Tumor Membrane&#8208;Targeted Photosensitive Dimer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Overcoming the resistance to apoptosis and immunosuppression of tumor cells is a significant challenge in augmenting the effect of cancer immunotherapy. Pyroptosis, a lytic programmed cell death pathway unlike apoptosis, is considered a type of immunogenic cell death (ICD) that can intensify the ICD process in tumor cells, releasing dramatically increased tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns to promote cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we report a tumor cell membrane&#8208;targeted aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitive dimer D1 that is found to be able to achieve highly efficient ICD under the synergistic effect of photodynamic and photothermal therapy. The photosensitive dimer can efficiently produce type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) by photodynamic therapy in hypoxic tumor tissue, leading to pyroptosis by direct cell membrane damage, which is further reinforced by its photothermal effect. Furthermore, the enhanced ICD effect based on the dimer can completely eliminate the primary tumor on the seventh day of treatment, and can also boost systemic antitumor immunity by generating immune memory, which is demonstrated by the superior antitumor therapeutic effects on both solid tumors and metastatic tumors when healing 4T1 tumor mouse models with poor immunogenicity.

         <title>Deciphering Structural Origins of Highly Reversible Lithium Storage in High Entropy Oxides with In Situ Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have been considered revolutionary electrode materials with both reversible lithium storage and high specific capacity that are difficult to fulfill simultaneously by conventional electrodes. However, precise understanding of lithium storage mechanisms in such HEOs remains controversial due to complex multi&#8208;cationic oxide systems. Here, distinct reaction dynamics and structural evolutions in rocksalt&#8208;type HEOs upon cycling are carefully studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including imaging, electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy at atomic scale. The mechanisms of composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics along with spatiotemporal variations of valence states upon lithiation are revealed, characterized by disappearance of the original rocksalt phase. Unexpectedly, we find the first visualization evidence that the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase state can be recovered to the original rocksalt&#8208;structured HEOs via reversible and symmetrical delithiation reactions, which is unavailable for monometallic oxide systems. Rigorous electrochemical tests coupled with postmortem ex situ TEM and bulk&#8208;level phase analyses further validate the crucial role of structural recovery capability in ensuring the reversible high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;storage in HEOs. Our findings can provide valuable guidelines to design compositionally engineer HEOs for almighty electrodes of next&#8208;generation long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Dynamic Stabilization of Metastable States in Triple&#8208;well Ferroelectric Sn2P2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polarization dynamics in ferroelectric materials is governed by the effective potential energy landscape of the order parameter. The unique aspect of ferroelectrics compared to many other transitions is the possibility of more than two potential wells; this prospect leads to complicated energy landscapes with new fundamental and functional properties. In this work, we reveal direct dynamic evidence of a triple&#8208;well potential in the metal thiophosphate Sn2P2S6 compound using multivariate scanning probe microscopy combined with theoretical simulations. Our key finding is that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a gradual switching process and is surprisingly stabilized over a broad range of electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the non&#8208;polar state of the triple well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the triple well of Sn2P2S6 becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric hysteresis loop. Therefore, this material combines the robust and well&#8208;defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in an antiferroelectric state. Moreover, the triple&#8208;well also enhances mem&#8208;capacitive effects in Sn2P2S6 which are forbidden for ideal double&#8208;well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high&#8208;density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on three thermodynamically stable ferroelectric states.

         <title>Monolayer superconductivity and tunable topological electronic structure at the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The interface between two&#8208;dimensional topological Dirac states and an s&#8208;wave superconductor is expected to support Majorana bound states that can be used for quantum computing applications. Realizing these novel states of matter and their applications requires control over superconductivity and spin&#8208;orbit coupling to achieve spin&#8208;momentum locked topological surface states which are simultaneously superconducting. While signatures of Majorana bound states have been observed in the magnetic vortex cores of bulk FeTe0.55Se0.45, inhomogeneity and disorder from doping makes these signatures unclear and inconsistent between vortices. Here we report superconductivity in monolayer FeTe1&#8208;ySey (Fe(Te,Se)) grown on Bi2Te3 by molecular beam epitaxy. Spin and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly resolves the interfacial spin and electronic structure of Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 heterostructures. We find that for y = 0.25 the Fe(Te,Se) electronic structure overlaps with the topological Bi2Te3 interfacial states and the desired spin&#8208;momentum locking is not observed. In contrast, for y = 0.1 we find reduced inhomogeneity measured by scanning tunneling microscopy and a smaller Fe(Te,Se) Fermi surface with clear spin&#8208;momentum locking in the topological states. Hence, we demonstrate the Fe(Te,Se)/Bi2Te3 system is a highly tunable platform for realizing Majorana bound states where reduced doping can improve characteristics important for Majorana interrogation and potential applications.

         <title>Colorful Electrochromic Displays with High Visual Quality Based on Porous Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The introduction of metamaterials into electrochromic (EC) displays has recently inspired a great breakthrough in the EC field, as this can offer a variety of new attractive features, from a very wide gamut of colors to very fast switching times. However, such metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays still face significant constraints when developing from single electrodes to full devices, because other supportive&#160;components in devices, such as counter electrodes and electrolytes, significantly affect light propagation and the subsequent perceived color quality in metamaterial&#8208;based EC devices. Herein, we report a new, cost&#8208;effective device design structured around a new type of porous metamaterial to circumvent the critical problem in metamaterial&#8208;based EC displays. Owing to its unique design, the metamaterial&#8208;based EC device achieves good color quality with no drop in brightness or shift in color chromaticity when compared with a single electrode. Moreover, the porous metamaterial&#8208;based EC device can exhibit non&#8208;iridescence and be viewed from a wide range of angles (5&#176;&#8211;85&#176;) and has fast switching response (2.4 and 2.5 s for coloration and bleaching, respectively), excellent cycling performance (at least 2000 cycles), and extremely low power consumption (4.0&#160;mW/cm2).

         <title>Supporting Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks on S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hybrid materials, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the rational construction of hybrid structures with decent physical/electrochemical properties is yet challenging. Herein, we delicately fabricate a promising OER electrocatalyst composed of trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) via a cation&#8208;exchange strategy. Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating exposure of active sites, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers outstanding activity and stability for alkaline OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 296&#160;mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. In combination with X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed Fe/Co&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during the OER operation is revealed to account for the high OER performance of S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF.

         <title>Doping by Design: Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of GeSe Alloys Through Metavalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Doping is usually the first step to tailor thermoelectrics. It enables precise control of the charge carrier concentration and concomitant transport properties. Doping should also turn GeSe, which features intrinsically a low carrier concentration, into a competitive thermoelectric. Yet, elemental doping fails to improve the carrier concentration. In contrast, alloying with Ag&#8208;V&#8208;VI2 compounds causes a remarkable enhancement of thermoelectric performance. This advance is closely related to a transition in the bonding mechanism, as evidenced by sudden changes in the optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, the Born effective charge, the maximum of the optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), and the bond&#8208;breaking behavior. These property changes are indicative of the formation of metavalent bonding (MVB), leading to an octahedral&#8208;like atomic arrangement. MVB is accompanied by a thermoelectric&#8208;favorable band structure featuring anisotropic bands with small effective masses and a large degeneracy. A quantum&#8208;mechanical map, which distinguishes different types of chemical bonding, reveals that orthorhombic GeSe employs covalent bonding, while rhombohedral and cubic GeSe utilize MVB. The transition from covalent to MVB goes along with a pronounced improvement in thermoelectric performance. The failure or success of different dopants can be explained by this concept, which redefines doping rules and provides a &#8220;treasure map&#8221; to tailor p&#8208;bonded chalcogenides.

         <title>A Mechanistic Insight into the Oxygen Redox of Li&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes and their Related Electronic/Atomic Behaviors Upon Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li&#8208;rich cathodes have been extensively investigated as their energy density is superior to Li stoichiometric cathode materials. In addition to the transition metal redox, this intriguing electrochemical performance originates from the redox reaction of the anionic sub&#8208;lattice. This new redox process, the so&#8208;called anionic redox or, more directly, oxygen redox in the case of oxides, almost doubles the energy density of Li&#8208;rich cathodes compared to conventional cathodes. Numerous theoretical and experimental investigations have thoroughly established the current understanding of the oxygen redox of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. However, different reports are occasionally contradictory, indicating that current knowledge remains incomplete. Moreover, several practical issues still hinder the real&#8208;world application of Li&#8208;rich cathodes. As these issues are related to phenomena resulting from the electronic to atomic evolution induced by unstable oxygen redox, a fundamental multiscale understanding is essential for solving the problem. In this review, we attempt to summarize the current mechanistic understanding of oxygen redox, the origin of the practical problems, and how current studies tackle the issues.

         <title>Organic Binary and Ternary Cocrystal Engineering Based on Halogen Bonding Aimed at Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, there has been intense interest in pure organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (ORTP) from cocrystals composed of 1,4&#8208;diiodotetrafluorobenzene (DITFB) and a variety of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or their derivatives. To expand the possibility of halogen bonding&#8208;based cocrystals, we investigate the relationship between the crystal packing motifs and ORTP characteristics in binary cocrystals composed of DITFB and PAHs of phenanthrene (Phen), chrysene (Chry), and pyrene (Pyr), respectively. The &#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interactions determine not only the crystal packing motifs but also photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs). The Phen&#8208;DITFB and Chry&#8208;DITFB binary cocrystals with&#160;&#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;interactions show higher PLQY compared with that of the Pyr&#8208;DITFB binary cocrystal with &#960;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;&#160;interaction. Further, to clarify the effect of crystal structures on PLQY, ternary cocrystals are prepared by partially doping Pyr into Phen&#8208;DITFB. The backbone of the crystal packing motif of the ternary cocrystal originates from a Phen&#8208;DITFB cocrystal with &#963;&#8208;hole&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; interaction, and some of the Phen sites are randomly replaced with Pyr molecules. The ORTP emission is derived from Pyr. The maximum PLQY is more than 20% due to suppressing nonradiative decay by changing the crystal packing motif.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Induced Optimization Mechanism for an Ultrathin&#8208;Strut Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Vascular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
To reduce incidences of in&#8208;stent restenosis and thrombosis, the use of a thinner&#8208;strut stent has been clinically proven to be effective. Therefore, the contemporary trend is towards the use of ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#956;m) designs for durable stents. However, stents made from biodegradable platforms have failed to achieve intergenerational breakthroughs due to their excessively thick struts. Here, microalloying was used to create an ultrathin&#8208;strut (65&#160;&#956;m) Zn scaffold with modified biodegradation behavior and improved biofunction, by adding Li. The scaffold backbone consists of an ultrafine&#8208;grained Zn matrix (average grain diameter 2.28&#160;&#956;m) with uniformly distributed nanoscale Li&#8208;containing phases. Grain refinement and precipitation strengthening enable it to achieve twice the radial strength with only 40% of the strut thickness of the pure Zn scaffold. Adding Li altered the thermodynamic formation pathways of products during scaffold biodegradation, creating an alkaline microenvironment. Li2CO3 may actively stabilize this microenvironment due to its higher solubility and better buffering capability than Zn products. The co&#8208;release of ionic zinc and lithium enhances the beneficial differential effects on activities of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, resulting in good endothelialization and limited intimal hyperplasia in porcine coronary arteries. Findings here may break the predicament of the next&#8208;generation biodegradable scaffolds.

         <title>Recent Advances of Seed&#8208;Mediated Growth of Metal Nanoparticles: from Growth to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Unprecedented advances in metal nanoparticle synthesis have paved the way for broad applications in sensing, imaging, catalysis, diagnosis and therapy by tuning optical properties, enhancing catalytic performance, and improving chemical and biological properties of metal nanoparticles. The central guiding concept for regulating the size and morphology of metal nanoparticles has been identified as the precise manipulation of nucleation and subsequent growth, often known as seed&#8208;mediated growth methods. However, since the growth process is sensitive not only to the metal seeds but also to capping agents, metal precursors, growth solution, growth/incubation time, reductant and other influencing factors, the precise control of metal nanoparticle morphology is multifactorial. Further, multiple reaction parameters are entangled with each other, so it is necessary to clarify the mechanism by which each factor precisely regulates the morphology of metal nanoparticles. In this review, to exploit the generality and extendibility of metal nanoparticle synthesis, we systematically summarized the mechanism of growth influencing factors in seed&#8208;mediated growth methods. Second, we focus on a variety of critical properties and applications enabled by grown metal nanoparticles. Finally, we review the current progress and offer insights on the challenges, opportunities, and future directions for the growth and applications of grown metal nanoparticles.

         <title>The transition from Elasto&#8208;Hydrodynamic to Mixed Regimes in Lubricated Friction of Soft Solid Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lubrication regime transition from the elasto&#8208;hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL)&#160;regime to the mixed lubrication (ML) regime for soft solids can happen when the lubricant film thickness is much larger than the substrate surface roughness. During sliding, wave&#8208;like undulations are observed, accompanied by fingering instabilities at the trailing edge. These instabilities are closely related to the lubrication regime transition.








Abstract
Lubricated contacts in soft materials are common in various engineering and natural settings, such as tires, haptic applications, contact lenses, and the fabrication of soft electronic devices. Two major regimes are elasto&#8208;hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL), in which solid surfaces are fully separated by a fluid film, and mixed lubrication (ML), in which there is partial solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid contact. The transition between these regimes governs the minimum sliding friction achievable and is thus very important. Generally, the transition from EHL to ML regimes is believed to occur when the thickness of the lubricant layer is comparable with the amplitude of surface roughness. Here, it is reported that in lubricated sliding experiments on smooth, soft, poly(dimethylsiloxane) substrates, the transition can occur when the thickness of the liquid layer is much larger than the height of the asperities. Direct visualization of the &#8220;contact&#8221; region shows that the transition corresponds to the formation of wave&#8208;like surface wrinkles at the leading contact edge and associated instabilities at the trailing contact edge, which are believed to trigger the transition to the mixed regime. These results change the understanding of what governs the important EHL&#8211;ML transition in the lubricated sliding of soft solids.

         <title>Organic Synthetic Photonic Systems with Reconfigurable Parity&#8211;Time Symmetry Breaking for Tunable Single&#8208;Mode Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic photonic material system with reconfigurable parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry breaking is proposed theoretically and realized experimentally. The composite system of functional organic molecules is deliberately designed and processed into reconfigurable PT symmetric microcavities. The molecular photoisomerization process reconfigures the PT symmetry breaking in the organic microcavity system, allowing for a record&#8208;breaking tunable single&#8208;mode laser performance.








Abstract
Synthetic photonic materials exploiting the quantum concept of parity&#8211;time (PT) symmetry lead to an emerging photonic paradigm&#8212;non&#8208;Hermitian photonics, which is revolutionizing the photonic sciences. The non&#8208;Hermitian photonics dealing with the interplay between gain and loss in PT synthetic photonic material systems offers a versatile platform for advancing microlaser technology. However, current PT&#8208;symmetric microcavity laser systems only manipulate imaginary parts of the refractive indices, suffering from limited laser spectral bandwidth. Here, an organic composite material system is proposed to synthesize reconfigurable PT&#8208;symmetric microcavities with controllable complex refractive indices for realizing tunable single&#8208;mode laser outputs. A grayscale electron&#8208;beam direct&#8208;writing technique is elaborately designed to process laser dye&#8208;doped polymer films in one single step into microdisk cavities with periodic gain and loss distribution, which enables thresholdless PT&#8208;symmetry breaking and single&#8208;mode laser operation. Furthermore, organic photoisomerizable compounds are introduced to reconfigure the PT&#8208;symmetric systems in real&#8208;time by tailoring the real refractive index of the polymer microresonators, allowing for a dynamically and continuously tunable single&#8208;mode laser output. This work fundamentally enhances the PT&#8208;symmetric photonic systems for innovative design of synthetic photonic materials and architectures.

         <title>Defect&#8208;induced, Ferroelectric&#8208;like Switching and Adjustable Dielectric Tunability in Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Antiferroelectrics, which undergo a field&#8208;induced phase transition to ferroelectric order that manifests as double&#8208;hysteresis polarization switching, exhibit great potential for dielectric, electromechanical, and electrothermal applications. Compared to their ferroelectric cousins, however, considerably fewer efforts have been made to understand and control antiferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated that the polarization switching behavior of an antiferroelectric can be strongly influenced and effectively regulated by point defects. In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during deposition (and thus increasing adatom kinetic energy) causes unexpected &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching although the films remain in the expected antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase. This &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; switching is correlated with the creation of bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes which pin the antiferroelectric&#8208;ferroelectric phase boundaries, and thus effectively delay the phase transition under changing field. The effective pinning energy is extracted via temperature&#8208;dependent switching&#8208;kinetics studies. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of the PbZrO3 can be adjusted, including being able to convert between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability near zero field. This work reveals the important role and strong capability of defects to engineer antiferroelectrics for new performance and functionalities.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of In&#8208;Memory Computing in a Ferrofluid System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic fluids are excellent candidates for several important research fields including energy harvesting, biomedical applications, soft robotics and exploration.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic fluids are excellent candidates for several important research fields including energy harvesting, biomedical applications, soft robotics and exploration. However, notwithstanding relevant advancements such as shape reconfigurability, that have been demonstrated, there is no evidence for their computing capability, including the emulation of synaptic functions, which requires complex non-linear dynamics. Here, we&#160;experimentally demonstrate that a Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; water-based Ferrofluid (FF) can perform electrical analogue computing and be programmed using quasi DC signals and read at Radio Frequency (RF) mode. We&#160;have observed features in all respects attributable to a memristive behaviour, featuring both short and long-term information storage capacity and plasticity. The colloid was&#160;capable of classifying digits of a 8&#160;&#215;&#160;8 pixel dataset using a custom in-memory signal processing scheme, and through Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) by training a readout layer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of in-memory computing using an amorphous FF system in a liquid aggregation state. This work poses the basis for the exploitation of a FF colloid as both an in-memory computing device and as a full-electric liquid computer thanks to its fluidity and the reported complex dynamics, via probing read-out and programming&#160;ports.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reaction Site Designation by Intramolecular Electric Field in Tr&#246;ger's&#8208;Base&#8208;Derived Conjugated Microporous Polymer for Near&#8208;Unity Selectivity of CO2 Photoconversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rigid V&#8208;shaped configured Tr&#246;ger's base is introduced to the construction of a covalent microporous polymer. Superior CO2 adsorption/activation capacity and an intramolecular electric field of the polymer are demonstrated. The carrier&#8208;recombination suppression and reaction&#8208;site designation from the synergy of the conjugated network and intramolecular electric field result in a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with approximately unity CO selectivity.








Abstract
To facilitate solar&#8208;driven overall CO2 and H2O convsersion into fuels and O2, a series of covalent microporous polymers derived from Tr&#246;ger's base are synthesized featuring flexural backbone and unusual charge&#8208;transfer properties. The incorporation of rigid structural twist Tr&#246;ger's base unit grants the polymers enhanced microporosity and CO2 adsorption/activation capacity. Density function theory calculations and photo&#8208;electrochemical analyses reveal that an electric dipole moment (from negative to positive) directed to the Tr&#246;ger's base unit is formed across two obliquely opposed molecular fragments and induces an intramolecular electric field. The Tr&#246;ger's base unit located at folding point becomes an electron trap to attract photogenerated electrons in the molecular network, which brings about suppression of carrier recombination and designates the reaction site in synergy with the conjugated network. In response to the discrepancy in reaction pathways across the reaction sites, the product allocation in the catalytic reaction is thereby regulated. Optimally, CMP&#8208;nTB achieves the highest photocatalytic CO production of 163.53&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with approximately unity selectivity, along with H2O oxidation to O2 in the absence of any photosensitizer or co&#8208;catalyst. This work provides new insight for developing specialized artificial organic photocatalysts.

         <title>Porous Organic Polymer with Hierarchical Structure and Limited Volume Expansion for Ultrafast and Highly Durable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing sustainable organic electrode materials with high&#8208;rate capability and satisfactory cycle lifespan is one of the key parameters for exploiting the next&#8208;generation sodium&#8208;ion batteries at practical levels. In this work, a facile polymerization strategy is developed for preparing a porous organic polymer with a hierarchical structure and limited volume expansion that enables ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage.








Abstract
Sustainable organic electrode materials, as promising alternatives to conventional inorganic electrode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), are still challenging to realize long&#8208;lifetime and high&#8208;rate batteries because of their poor conductivity, limited electroactivity, and severe dissolution. It is also urgent to deeply reveal their electrochemical mechanism and evolution processes. A porous organic polymer (POP) with a conjugated and hierarchical structure is designed and synthesized here. The unique molecule and structure endow the POP with electron delocalization, high ionic diffusivity, plentiful active sites, exceptional structure stability, and limited solubility in electrolytes. When evaluated as an anode for SIBs, the POP exhibits appealing electrochemical properties regarding reversible capacity, rate behaviors, and long&#8208;duration life. Importantly, using judiciously combined experiments and theoretical computation, including in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and ex situ spectroscopy,&#160;we&#160;reveal the Na&#8208;storage mechanism and dynamic evolution processes of the POP, including 12&#8208;electron reaction process with Na, low volume expansion (125&#8211;106% vs the initial 100%), and stable composition and structure evolution during repeating sodiation/de&#8208;sodiation processes. This quantitative design for ultrafast and highly durable sodium storage in the POP could be of immediate benefit for the rational design of organic electrode materials with ideal electrochemical properties.

         <title>DNA Nanoclusters Combined with One&#8208;Shot Radiotherapy Augments&#160;Cancer Immunotherapy Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable CpG DNA nanocluster termed as DNAnc loads &#8776;8125 copies of CpG ODNs in a single nanoparticle. It efficiently repolarizes macrophages from an M2&#8208;like phenotype into an M1&#8208;like phenotype to elicit a robust abscopal effect, which successfully stimulates CD8+&#8208;T&#8208;cells&#8208;mediated suppression of tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence after one&#8208;shot radiotherapy.








Abstract
Immunotherapy shows immense promise for improving cancer treatment. Combining immunotherapy with radiotherapy provides a conspicuous advantage due to its enhanced abscopal effect. However, established immune tolerance mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment can hamper the generation of a sufficient abscopal effect. Herein, a type of DNA nanocluster (DNAnc) that is self&#8208;assembled by a CpG&#8208;ODNs&#8208;loaded Y&#8208;shaped double&#8208;stranded DNA vector based on the unique complementary base&#8208;pairing rules is designed. The unique structure of DNAnc makes it load more than &#8776;8125.5 &#177; 822.5 copies of CpG ODNs within one single nanostructure, which effectively increases resistance to nuclease degradation and elevates the efficiency of repolarizing macrophages to an M1&#8208;like phenotype. Mechanistic studies reveal that more DNAncs are endocytosed by macrophages in the cancer tissue and repolarized macrophages to elicit a robust abscopal effect with the accumulation of macrophages induced by radiotherapy, generating potent, long&#8208;term, and durable antitumor immunity for the inhibition of tumor metastasis and the prevention of tumor recurrence, which provides a novel strategy to boost cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Strongly Correlated Exciton&#8208;Magnetization System for Optical Spin Pumping in CrBr3 and CrI3.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chromium trihalides are considered canonical two&#8208;dimensional ferromagnets. The emergent magnetization is coupled with the photoexcited excitons via exchange interactions. Despite chemical and structural similarities, the nature of this coupling is qualitatively different between CrBr3 and CrI3. The opposite sign of the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling enables realization of optical spin pumping in CrBr3, revealing the origin of ferromagnetic hysteresis in photoluminescence experiments.








Abstract
Ferromagnetism in van der Waals systems, preserved down to a monolayer limit, attracted attention to a class of materials with general composition CrX3 (X=I, Br, and Cl), which are treated now as canonical 2D ferromagnets. Their diverse magnetic properties, such as different easy axes or varying and controllable character of in&#8208;plane or interlayer ferromagnetic coupling, make them promising candidates for spintronic, photonic, optoelectronic, and other applications. Still, significantly different magneto&#8208;optical properties between the three materials have been presenting a challenging puzzle for researchers over the last few years. Herewith, it is demonstrated that despite similar structural and magnetic configurations, the coupling between excitons and magnetization is qualitatively different in CrBr3 and CrI3 films. Through a combination of the optical spin pumping experiments with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theory describing bound excitonic states in the presence of magnetization, we&#160;concluded that the hole&#8208;magnetization coupling has the opposite sign in CrBr3 and CrI3 and also between the ground and excited exciton state. Consequently, efficient spin pumping capabilities are demonstrated in CrBr3 driven by magnetization via spin&#8208;dependent absorption, and the different origins of the magnetic hysteresis in CrBr3 and CrI3 are unraveled.

         <title>Optimizing the Fermi Level of a 3D Current Collector with Ni3S2/Ni3P Heterostructure for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on theoretical simulation, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) with high work function is developed as a current collector for dendrite&#8208;free sodium&#8208;metal anodes. The excellent electrochemical performance of Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na can be attributed to enhanced sodiophilicity, fast ion&#8208;transport kinetics, and uniform solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase structures.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries (RSMBs) with high energy density and low cost are attracting extensive attention as promising energy&#8208;storage technologies. However, the poor cyclability and safety issues caused by unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) structure and dendrite issues limit their practical application. Herein, it is theoretically predicted that constructing the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure with high work function can lower the Fermi energy level, and therefore effectively suppressing continuous electrolyte decomposition derived from the electron&#8208;tunneling effect after long&#8208;term sodiation process. Furthermore, the Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure on 3D porous nickel foam (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF) is experimentally fabricated as an advanced Na&#8208;anode current collector. The seamless Ni3S2/Ni3P heterostructure not only offers abundant active sites to induce uniform Na+ deposition and enhance ion&#8208;transport kinetics, but also facilitates the formation of stable SEI for dendrite&#8208;free sodium anode, which are confirmed by cryogenic components transmission electron microscopy tests and in situ spectroscopy characterization. As a result, the Na&#8208;composite anode (Ni3S2/Ni3P@NF@Na) delivers stable plating/stripping process of 5000 h and high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 2500 cycles. More impressively, the assembled sodium&#8208;ion full cell displays ultralong cycle life of 10&#160;000 cycles at 20 C. The strategy of stabilizing the sodium&#8208;metal anode gives fundamental insight into the potential construction of advanced RSMBs.

         <title>Strong&#8208;Proton&#8208;Adsorption Co&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts Achieve Active and Stable Neutral Seawater Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct electrolysis of pH&#8208;neutral seawater is not only a promising approach to produce clean hydrogen energy, but also of great significance to seawater desalination. Now, both the simulations and experimental characterizations illustrate that incorporating the strong&#8208;proton&#8208;adsorption cations into Co3O4 can increase the rate&#8208;determining water dissociation step and achieve industrially required current density of &gt;200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in natural seawater.








Abstract
Direct electrolysis of pH&#8208;neutral seawater to generate hydrogen is an attractive approach for storing renewable energy. However, due to the anodic competition between the chlorine evolution and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), direct seawater splitting suffers from a low current density and limited operating stability. Exploration of catalysts enabling an OER overpotential below the hypochlorite formation overpotential (&#8776;490&#160;mV) is critical to suppress the chloride evolution and facilitate seawater splitting. Here, a proton&#8208;adsorption&#8208;promoting strategy to increase the OER rate is reported, resulting in a promoted and more stable neutral seawater splitting. The best catalysts herein are strong&#8208;proton&#8208;adsorption (SPA) materials such as palladium&#8208;doped cobalt oxide (Co3&#8211;xPdxO4) catalysts. These achieve an OER overpotential of 370&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in pH&#8208;neutral simulated seawater, outperforming Co3O4 by a margin of 70&#160;mV. Co3&#8211;xPdxO4 catalysts provide stable catalytic performance for 450&#160;h at 200&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 20&#160;h at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 in neutral seawater. Experimental studies and theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of SPA cations accelerates the rate&#8208;determining water dissociation step in neutral OER pathway, and control studies rule out the provision of additional OER sites as a main factor herein.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure Dynamics of Nanocrystals Revealed By In Situ and Environmental Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state of the art of in situ and environmental transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and recent advances in structure dynamics of nanocrystals are reviewed. The nucleation and growth of nanocrystals, structure dynamics, and structure evolution under reaction conditions are discussed in detail. The methodologies and challenges of in situ TEM are also proposed.








Abstract
Nanocrystals are of great importance in material sciences and industry. Engineering nanocrystals with desired structures and properties is no doubt one of the most important challenges in the field, which requires deep insight into atomic&#8208;scale dynamics of nanocrystals during the process. The rapid developments of in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), especially environmental TEM, reveal insights into nanocrystals to digest. According to the considerable progress based on in situ electron microscopy, a comprehensive review on nanocrystal dynamics from three aspects: nucleation and growth, structure evolution, and dynamics in reaction conditions are given. In the nucleation and growth part, existing nucleation theories and growth pathways are organized based on liquid and gas&#8211;solid phases. In the structure evolution part, the focus is on in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the evolution, including defects, phase, and disorder/order transitions. In the part of dynamics in reaction conditions, solid&#8211;solid and gas&#8211;solid interfaces of nanocrystals in atmosphere are discussed and the structure&#8211;property relationship is correlated. Even though impressive progress is made, additional efforts are required to develop the integrated and operando TEM methodologies for unveiling nanocrystal dynamics with high spatial, energy, and temporal resolutions.

         <title>Monolithic Zirconium&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Energy&#8208;Efficient Water Adsorption Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Space cooling and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) accounts for roughly 10% of global electricity use and is responsible for ca. 1.13 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions annually. Adsorbent&#8208;based HVAC technologies have long been touted as an energy&#8208;efficient alternative to traditional refrigeration systems. However, thus far, no suitable adsorbents have been developed which overcome the drawbacks associated with traditional sorbent materials such as silica gels and zeolites. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) offer order of magnitude improvements in water adsorption and regeneration energy requirements. However, the deployment of MOFs in HVAC applications has been hampered by issues related to MOF powder processing. Herein, we develop three high&#8208;density, shaped, monolithic MOFs (UiO&#8208;66, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 and Zr&#8208;Fumarate) with exceptional volumetric gas/vapor uptake &#8211; solving previous issues in MOF&#8208;HVAC deployment. We visualized the monolithic structures across the mesoporous range using SAXS and lattice&#8208;gas models, giving accurate predictions of adsorption characteristics of the monolithic materials. We also demonstrate that a fragile MOF such as Zr&#8208;fumarate can be synthesized in monolithic form with a bulk density of 0.76 gcm&#8722;3 without losing any adsorption performance, having a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.71 with a low regeneration temperature (&#8804; 100 &#7506;C).

         <title>An Edible Rechargeable Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Edible electronics is a growing field that aims to produce digestible devices using only food ingredients and additives, thus addressing many of the shortcomings of ingestible electronic devices. Edible electronic devices would have major implications for gastrointestinal tract monitoring, therapeutics, as well as rapid food quality monitoring. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of edible circuits and sensors, but to realize fully edible electronic devices edible power sources are required, of which there have been very few examples. Drawing inspiration from living organisms, which use redox cofactors to power biochemical machines, we develop a rechargeable edible battery formed from materials eaten in everyday life. The battery is realized by immobilizing riboflavin and quercetin, common food ingredients and dietary supplements, on activated carbon, a widespread food additive. Riboflavin was used as the anode, while quercetin was used as the cathode. By encapsulating the electrodes in beeswax, a fully edible battery was fabricated capable of supplying power to small electronic devices. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept battery cell operated at 0.65&#160;V, sustaining a current of 48&#160;&#956;A for 12 minutes. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept would open the doors to new edible electronic applications, enabling safer and easier medical diagnostics, treatments, and unexplored ways to monitor food quality.

         <title>Move Aside Pentacene: Diazapentacene Doped Para&#8208;Terphenyl, a Zero&#8208;Field Room&#8208;Temperature Maser with Strong Coupling for Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Masers can deliver ultra&#8208;low&#8208;noise amplification of microwave signals in medical imaging and deep&#8208;space communication, with recent research being rekindled through the discovery of gain media operating at room&#8208;temperature, eschewing bulky cryogenics that hindered their use. This work shows the discovery of 6,13&#8208;diazapentacene doped in para&#8208;terphenyl (DAP:PTP) as a maser gain medium that can operate at room&#8208;temperature, without an external magnetic field. With a maser output power of &#8208;10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene&#8208;doped para&#8208;terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups. Furthermore, the maser bursts from DAP:PTP allow one to reach the strong coupling regime for cavity quantum electrodynamics, where it has a high cooperativity of 182. The optical and microwave spin dynamics of DAP:PTP are studied in order to evaluate its capabilities as a maser gain medium, where it features fast intersystem crossing and an advantageously higher triplet quantum yield. The results pave the way for the future discovery of similar maser materials and help designate them as promising candidates for quantum sensors, optoelectronic devices and the study of cavity quantum electrodynamic effects at&#160;room&#8208;temperature.

With a maser output power of -10 dBm, it is on par with pentacene-doped para-terphenyl in masing power, while possessing compelling advantages such as faster amplification startup times, being pumped by longer wavelength light at 620 nm and greater chemical stability from nitrogen groups.

         <title>Unusual Temperature Dependence of Water Sorption in Semi&#8208;Crystalline Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water vapor sorption is a ubiquitous phenomenon in nature and plays an important role in various applications including humidity regulation, energy storage, thermal management, and water harvesting. In particular, capturing moisture at elevated temperatures is highly desirable to prevent dehydration and enlarge the tunability of water uptake. However, owing to the thermodynamic limit of conventional materials, sorbents inevitably tend to capture less water vapor at higher temperatures, impeding their broad applications. Here, we report an inverse temperature dependence of water sorption observed in polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels, where their water uptake can be doubled with increasing temperature from 25 to 50&#176;C. With mechanistic modeling of water&#8208;polymer interactions, we show that this unusual water sorption is attributed to the first&#8208;order phase transformation of PEG structures and identify the key parameters for a more generalized strategy in materials development. This work elucidates a new regime of water sorption with an unusual temperature dependence, enabling a promising engineering space for harnessing moisture and heat.

         <title>Biomimetic Construction of Ferrite Quantum Dot/Graphene Heterostructure for Enhancing Ion/charge Transfer in Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spinel ferrites are regarded as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) in virtue of their low cost and high theoretical specific capacitances. However, bulk ferrites suffer from limited electrical conductivity, sluggish ion transport, and inadequate active sites. Therefore, rational structural design and composition regulation of the ferrites are approaches to overcome these limitations. Herein, a general biomimetic mineralization synthetic strategy is proposed to synthesize ferrite (XFe2O4, X = Ni, Co, Mn) quantum dot/graphene (QD/G) heterostructures. Anchoring ferrite QD on the graphene sheets not only strengthens the structural stability, but also forms the electrical conductivity network needed to boost the ion diffusion and charge transfer. The optimized NiFe2O4 QD/G heterostructure exhibits specific capacitances of 697.5 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and exceptional cycling performance. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetrical SCs deliver energy densities of 24.4 and 17.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at power densities of 499.3 and 4304.2&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively. Density functional theory calculations indicate the combination of NiFe2O4 QD and graphene facilitates the adsorption of potassium atoms, ensuring rapid ion/charge transfer. This work enriches the application of the biomimetic mineralization synthesis and provides effective strategies for boosting ion/charge transfer, which may offer a new way to develop advanced electrodes for SCs.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries: From Fundamental Research to Industrialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are on the verge of transitioning from lab&#8208;level fundamental research to large&#8208;scale manufacturing. In this review, approaches to address the intrinsic physicochemical shortcomings of LMBs at the material and electrode levels are summarized. Issues relating to scaling up lab&#8208;scale knowledge and the adoption and resolution thereof by industry are reviewed together with processing and economic considerations.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) are representative of post&#8208;lithium&#8208;ion batteries with the great promise of increasing the energy density drastically by utilizing the low operating voltage and high specific capacity of metallic lithium. LMBs currently stand at a point of transition at which the accumulation of knowledge from fundamental research is being translated into large&#8208;scale commercialization. This review summarizes the available strategies for addressing the intrinsic shortcomings of LMBs, such as the suppression of dendritic growth and parasitic reactions from the material to the electrode to the cell level. The discussion pertaining to the cell level includes efforts and concerns relating to scaling up established knowledge and expertise with the view of commercialization. This review intends to encourage researchers in both fundamental research institutions and industry to make a synergistic effort and share their views comprehensively to ensure that LMB technology continues to evolve in harmony to become a mature technology.

         <title>Rapid Data&#8208;Efficient Optimization of Perovskite Nanocrystal Syntheses through Machine Learning Algorithm Fusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing and optimizing novel, efficient nanomaterials for renewable energies is arduous; however, machine learning can support this process. Here, three machine&#8208;learning algorithms are merged with Bayesian optimization to significantly improve halide perovskite nanoplatelets&#8217; homogeneity and optical properties. Significantly, the algorithm fusion results in a data&#8208;efficient pipeline, requiring an order of magnitude fewer syntheses than previous methods to function proficiently.








Abstract
With the demand for renewable energy and efficient devices rapidly increasing, a need arises to find and optimize novel (nano)materials. With sheer limitless possibilities for material combinations and synthetic procedures, obtaining novel, highly functional materials has been a tedious trial and error process. Recently, machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to help optimize syntheses; however, most approaches require a substantial amount of input data, limiting their pertinence. Here, three well&#8208;known machine&#8208;learning models are merged with Bayesian optimization into one to optimize the synthesis of CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets with limited data demand. The algorithm can accurately predict the photoluminescence emission maxima of nanoplatelet dispersions using only the three precursor ratios as input parameters. This allows us to fabricate previously unobtainable seven and eight monolayer&#8208;thick nanoplatelets. Moreover, the algorithm dramatically improves the homogeneity of 2&#8211;6&#8208;monolayer&#8208;thick nanoplatelet dispersions, as evidenced by narrower and more symmetric photoluminescence spectra. Decisively, only 200 total syntheses are required to achieve this vast improvement, highlighting how rapidly material properties can be optimized. The algorithm is highly versatile and can incorporate additional synthetic parameters. Accordingly, it is readily applicable to other less&#8208;explored nanocrystal syntheses and can help rapidly identify and improve exciting compositions&#8217; quality.

Accordingly, it is readily applicable to other less-explored nanocrystal syntheses and can help rapidly identify and improve exciting compositions&#8217; quality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Localized bound multiexcitons in engineered quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites grains at room temperature for efficient lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reducing the excitation threshold to minimize the Joule heating is critical for the realization of perovskite laser diodes. Although bound excitons are promising for low threshold laser, how to generate them at room temperature for laser applications is still unclear in quasi two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, via engineering quasi&#8208;2D perovskite PEA2(CH3NH3)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 microscopic grains by the anti&#8208;solvent method, we successfully demonstrate room&#8208;temperature multiexciton radiative recombination at a remarkably low pump density of 0.97 &#956;J cm&#8722;2, which is only one&#8208;fourth of that required in 2D CdSe nanosheets. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination which is detrimental to radiative emission. Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains are favorable for increasing binding energies of excitons and biexcitons and so as the related radiative recombination. Consequently, the prepared &lt;n = 8&gt; phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film renders a threshold of room&#8208;temperature stimulated emission as low as 13.7 &#956;J cm&#8722;2, reduced by 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains. The findings in this work are expected to facilitate the development of solution&#8208;processable perovskite multiexcitonic laser diodes.

         <title>Highly Efficient Mixed Conduction in a Fused Oligomer n&#8208;Type Organic Semiconductor Enabled by Three&#8208;Dimensional Transport Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tailoring organic semiconductors to facilitate mixed conduction of ionic and electronic charges when interfaced with an aqueous media has spurred many recent advances in organic bioelectronics. The field is still restricted, however, by very few n&#8208;type (electron&#8208;transporting) organic semiconductors with adequate performance metrics. Here, a new electron&#8208;deficient, fused polycyclic aromatic system, TNR, is reported with excellent n&#8208;type mixed conduction properties including a &#956;C* figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value exceeding 30 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for the best performing derivative. Comprising three naphthalene bis&#8208;isatin moieties, this new molecular design builds on successful small&#8208;molecule mixed conductors; by extending the molecular scaffold into the oligomer domain, good film&#8208;forming properties, strong pi&#8208;pi interactions, and consequently excellent charge transport properties are obtained. Through judicious optimization of the side chains, the linear oligoether and branched alkyl chain derivative bgTNR is obtained which shows superior mixed conduction in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) configuration including an electron mobility around 0.3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. By optimizing the side chains, the dominant molecular packing can be changed from a preferential edge&#8208;on orientation (with high charge transport anisotropy) to an oblique orientation that can support three&#8208;dimensional transport pathways which in turn ensure highly efficient mixed conduction properties across the bulk semiconductor film.

         <title>Coordination chemistry of large&#8208;size yttrium single&#8208;atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although being transition metals, the Fenton&#8208;inactive group 3&#8211;4 elements (Sc, Y, La, Ti, Zr, and Hf) could easily lose all the outermost s and d electrons, leaving behind ionic sites with nearly empty outermost orbitals that are stable but inactive for oxygen involved catalysis. We demonstrate here that the dynamic coordination network could turn these commonly inactive ionic sites into platinum&#8208;like catalytic centers for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Using density functional theory calculations, we identify a macrocyclic ligand coordinated yttrium single&#8208;atom (YN4) moiety, which is originally ORR inactive because of the too strong binding of hydroxyl intermediate, while it could be activated by an axial ligand X through the covalency competition between Y&#8208;X and Y&#8208;OH bonds. Strikingly, it is also found that the binding force of the axially coordinated ligand is an effective descriptor, and the chlorine ligand is screened out with an optimal binding force that behaves self&#8208;adaptively to facilitate each ORR intermediate steps by dynamically changing its Y&#8208;Cl covalency. Our experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed YN4&#8208;Cl moieties embedded within the carbon framework exhibit a high half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.85&#160;V) in alkaline media, the same as that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst, and it delivers a maximum power density of 162 mWcm&#8722;2 in a zinc&#8208;air cell, outperforming the commercial Pt/C (152&#160;mW cm&#8722;2).

         <title>A Nanotherapeutic Strategy to Reverse NK Cell Exhaustion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As a specialized immune effector cell, natural killer (NK) cells play a very important role in immunotherapy, but tumor immunosuppression caused by abnormal expression of cancer cells seriously weakens its therapeutic effect and leads to exhaustion. Here, we developed a self&#8208;assembled selenium containing nanoparticles (NPs) composed of Cetuximab, C5SeSeC5 and inhibitor LY345899 to reverse NK cell exhaustion. The obtained NPs can target EGFR on the surface of cancer cells and locate in mitochondria. The released LY345899 could inhibit the activity of methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) and produce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the formation of seleninic acid, further reducing the expression of HLA&#8208;E, which was responsible for the NKG2A&#8208;related NK cell inhibition. As a result, the enhanced NK cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy in conjunction with the Cetuximab&#8208;mediated ADCC effect can not only effectively inhibit the growth of xenograft tumors, but also significantly suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect. This work, the combination of seleninic acid, LY345899 and Cetuximab, provides a new strategy for reversing NK cell exhaustion and has great potential for use in the treatment of metastatic tumors.

         <title>Impairing Tumor Metabolic Plasticity Via a Stable Metal&#8208;Phenolic Based Polymeric Nanomedicine to Suppress Colorectal Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Targeting metabolic vulnerability of tumor cells is a promising anti&#8208;cancer strategy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of existing metabolism&#8208;regulating agents is often compromised due to tolerance resulting from tumor metabolic plasticity, as well as their poor bioavailability and tumor&#8208;targetability. Inspired by the inhibitive effect of N&#8208;ethylmaleimide on the mitochondrial function, we developed a dendronized polymer&#8208;functionalized metal&#8208;phenolic nanomedicine (pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP) encapsulating N&#8208;ethylmaleimide&#8208;modified doxorubicin (Mal&#8208;DOX) to enable improvement in the overall delivery efficiency and inhibition of the tumor metabolism via multiple pathways. We observe that Mal&#8208;DOX and its derived nanomedicine induce energy depletion of CT26 colorectal cancer cells more efficiently than doxorubicin, and shifts the balance of programmed cell death from apoptosis toward necroptosis. Notably, pOEG&#8208;b&#8208;D&#8208;SH@NP simultaneously inhibits cellular oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, thus potently suppressing cancer growth and peritoneal intestinal metastasis in mouse models. Overall, the study provides a promising dendronized polymer&#8208;derived nano&#8208;platform for the treatment of cancers through impairing metabolic plasticity.

         <title>Superlattice Nanofilm on Touchscreen for Photoexcited Bacteria and Virus Killing by Tuning Electronic Defects in Heterointerface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, the global COVID&#8208;19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high&#8208;frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self&#8208;disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier. In this study, we design a ZnO&#8208;Fe2O3 superlattice nanofilm via atomic layer deposition for photocatalytic bactericidal and virucidal touchscreen. Additionally, we engineer electronic defects in the superlattice heterointerface. Photogenerated electrons and holes will be rapidly separated and transferred into ZnO and Fe2O3 across the heterointerfaces owing to the formation of Zn&#8208;O, Fe&#8208;O, and Zn&#8208;Fe covalent bonds at the heterointerfaces, where ZnO and Fe2O3 function as electronic donors and receptors, respectively. The high generation capacity of reactive oxygen species results in a high antibacterial and antiviral efficacy (&gt;90%) even against drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and H1N1 viruses under simulated solar or low&#8208;power LED light irradiation. Meanwhile, this superlattice nanofilm on a touchscreen shows excellent light transmission (&gt;90%), abrasion resistance (106 times the round&#8208;trip friction), and biocompatibility. This study provides insights into engineered electronic defects in superlattices for the optimization of the charge transfer pathway, thus allowing the photocatalytic performance of self&#8208;disinfection smartphone touchscreens to be enhanced.

&lt;p&gt;Currently, the global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the public attention toward the spread of pathogenic viruses and bacteria on various high-frequency touch surfaces. Developing a self-disinfecting coating on a touchscreen is an urgent and meaningful task. Superlattice materials are among the most promising photocatalysts owing to their efficient charge transfer in abundant heterointerfaces. However, excess electronic defects at the heterointerfaces result in the loss of substantial amounts of photogenerated charge carrier.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Transmission Electron Microscopy for Sodium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries have attracted tremendous attentions in recent years due to the abundance and wide distribution of Na resource on the earth. However, SIBs still face the critical issues of low energy density and unsatisfactory cyclic stability at present. The enhancement of electrochemical performance of SIBs depends on comprehensive and precise understandings on the underlying sodium storage mechanism. Although extensive transmission electron microscopy investigations have been performed to reveal the sodium storage property and mechanism of SIBs, a dedicated review on the in&#8208;situ TEM investigations of SIBs has not been reported. In this review, recent progress in the in&#8208;situ TEM investigations on the morphological, structural and chemical evolutions of cathode materials, anode materials and solid&#8208;electrolyte interface during the sodium storage of SIBs have been comprehensively summarized. The detailed relationship between structure/composition of electrode materials and electrochemical performance of SIBs have been clarified. This review aims to provide insights into the effective selection and rational design of advanced electrode materials for high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Wearable and Implantable Cortisol Sensing Electronics for Stress Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released from the body in response to stress. Although a moderate level of cortisol secretion can help the body maintain homeostasis, excessive secretion can cause various diseases, such as depression and anxiety. Conventional methods for cortisol measurement undergo procedures that limit continuous monitoring, typically collecting samples of bodily fluids, followed by separate analysis in a laboratory setting that takes several hours. Thus, recent studies demonstrate wearable, miniaturized sensors integrated with electronic modules that enable wireless real&#8208;time analysis. In this review, we primarily focus on wearable and implantable electronic devices that continuously measure cortisol concentration. We discuss diverse types of cortisol sensing techniques, such as antibody&#8208;, DNA aptamer&#8208;, and molecularly imprinted polymer&#8208;based sensors, as well as wearable and implantable devices that aim to continuously monitor cortisol in a minimally invasive fashion. In addition to the cortisol monitors that directly measure stress levels, we also summarize other schemes that indirectly measure stress, such as electrophysiological signals and sweat. Finally, we review the challenges and future directions in stress monitoring and management electronics.

         <title>Thermally Latent Bases in Dynamic Covalent Polymer Networks and their Emerging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A novel strategy allowing a temporal control of dynamic bond exchange in covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer networks via latent transesterification catalysts is introduced. Obtained by a straight&#8208;forward air&#8208; and water&#8208;tolerant synthesis, the latent catalyst is designed for an irreversible temperature&#8208;mediated release of a strong organic base. Its long&#8208;term inactivity at temperatures below 50&#176;C provides the unique opportunity to equip dynamic covalent networks with creep resistance and high bond exchange rates, once activated. The presented thermally latent base catalyst is conveniently introducible in readily available building blocks and, as proof of concept, applied in a radically polymerized thiol&#8208;ene network. Light&#8208;mediated curing is used for 3D&#160;printing functional objects on which the possibility of spatially controlled reshaping and welding based on dynamic transesterification are illustrated. Since the catalyst is thermally activated, limitations regarding sample geometry and optical transparency do not apply, which facilitates a transfer to well&#8208;established industrial technologies. Consequently, fiber&#8208;reinforced and highly filled magneto&#8208;active thiol&#8208;ene polymer composites are fabricated by a thermal curing approach. The on&#8208;demand activation of dynamic transesterification is demonstrated by (magneto&#8208;assisted) reshaping experiments, highlighting a wide range of potential future applications offered by the presented concept.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Adaptable Indwelling Microneedles for Diabetic Ulcers Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microneedles provide an effective strategy for transdermal drug delivery. Many endeavors have been devoted to developing smart microneedles that can respond to and interact with pathophysiological environments. Here, we present novel bio&#8208;inspired adaptable indwelling microneedles with therapeutic exosome encapsulation for diabetic wound healing by a combined fabrication strategy of template replication and three&#8208;dimensional transfer printing. Such microneedles are composed of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)&#8208;exosomes encapsulated adjustable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel needle tips and detachable medical 3&#160;M tape supporting substrate. As the mechanical strength of the PVA hydrogel is ionic responsive due to Hofmeister effects, the hardness of the resultant microneedle tips could be up&#8208;regulated by sulfate ions to ensure skin penetration and be softened by nitrate ions after tip&#8208;substrate detachment to adapt to the surrounding tissue and release exosomes. Because the MSC&#8208;exosomes can effectively activate fibroblasts, vascular endothelial cells and macrophages, the indwelling microneedles are demonstrated with the function of promoting tissue regeneration and diabetic wound healing in full&#8208;thickness cutaneous wounds of diabetic rat models. These features indicate that the bio&#8208;inspired adaptable indwelling microneedles are with practical values and clinical prospects in tissue and wound regeneration.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Scanning Second Harmonic Generation Microscopy for Polar Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative aims to discover, develop, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials at twice the speed of conventional approaches. To achieve this, high&#8208;throughput characterization is essential for the rapid screening of candidate materials. In this study, we developed a high&#8208;throughput scanning second harmonic generation (HTS&#8208;SHG) microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning that can rapidly probe and screen polar materials. Using this technique, we first investigated typical ferroelectrics, including periodically poled lithium niobate crystals and PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films, whereby the microscopic domain structures were clearly revealed. We then applied this technique to a compositional&#8208;gradient (100&#8722;x)%BaTiO3&#8722;x%SrTiO3 film and a thickness&#8208;gradient PZT film to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities. Since SHG signal is correlated with the macroscopic remnant polarization over the probed region determined by the laser spot, it is free of artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, while materials symmetries and domain structures must be carefully considered in the data analysis. We believe this work can help promote the high&#8208;throughput development of polar materials, and contribute to Materials Genome Initiative.

         <title>CO2 Adsorption in a Robust Iron(III) Pyrazolate&#8208;Based MOF: Molecular&#8208;Level Details and Frameworks Dynamics From Powder X&#8208;ray Diffraction Adsorption Isotherms</title>

         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;depth CO2 adsorption and structural study enabled by a multi&#8208;technique approach on the robust pyrazolate&#8208;based MOF Fe2(BDP)3 shows that, with a proper treatment of HR&#8208;PXRD data at variable gas pressure and temperature, it is possible go beyond the classical crystallographic description of host&#8211;guest interactions, retrieving thermodynamic information of the adsorption process.








Abstract
Understanding adsorption processes at the molecular level, with multi&#8208;technique approaches, is nowadays at the frontier of porous materials research. In this work it is shown that with a proper data treatment, in situ high&#8208;resolution powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (HR&#8208;PXRD) at variable temperature and gas pressure can reveal atomic details of the accommodation sites, the framework dynamics as well as thermodynamic information (isosteric heat of adsorption) of the CO2 adsorption process in the robust iron(III) pyrazolate&#8208;based MOF Fe2(BDP)3 [H2BDP = 1,4&#8208;bis(1H&#8208;pyrazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)benzene]. Highly reliable &#8220;HR&#8208;PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; can be constructed from occupancy values of CO2 molecules. The &#8220;HR&#8208;PXRD adsorption isotherms&#8221; accurately match the results of conventional static and dynamic gas sorption experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. These results are indicative of the impact of the molecular&#8208;level behavior on the bulk properties of the system under study and of the potential of the presented multi&#8208;technique approach to understand adsorption processes in metal&#8211;organic frameworks.

         <title>Enhancing Photon Utilization Efficiency for High&#8208;Performance Organic Photovoltaic Cells via Regulating Phase&#8208;Transition Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiscale fibril network morphology is constructed using a ternary approach. An ideal morphology is beneficial for charge transfer and transport. Based on the optimized ternary system, outstanding PCEs of over 19.5% for single&#8208;junction cells and over 20% for tandem organic photovoltaic cells (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) are achieved.








Abstract
Efficient photon utilization is key to achieving high&#8208;performance organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. In this study, a multiscale fibril network morphology in a PBQx&#8208;TCl:PBDB&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based system is constructed by regulating donor and acceptor phase&#8208;transition kinetics. The distinctive phase&#8208;transition process and crystal size are systematically investigated. PBQx&#8208;TCl and eC9&#8208;2Cl form fibril structures with diameters of &#8776;25&#160;nm in ternary films. Additionally, fine fibrils assembled by PBDB&#8208;TF are uniformly distributed over the fibril networks of PBQx&#8208;TCl and eC9&#8208;2Cl. The ideal multiscale fibril network morphology enables the ternary system to achieve superior charge transfer and transport processes compared to binary systems; these improvements promote enhanced photon utilization efficiency. Finally, a high power conversion efficiency of 19.51% in a single&#8208;junction OPV cell is achieved. The external quantum efficiency of the optimized ternary cell exceeds 85% over a wide range of 500&#8211;800&#160;nm. A tandem OPV cell is also fabricated to increase solar photon absorption. The tandem cell has an excellent PCE of more than 20%. This study provides guidance for constructing an ideal multiscale fibril network morphology and improving the photon utilization efficiency of OPV cells.

         <title>25.24%&#8208;Efficiency FACsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells Enabled by Intermolecular Esterification Reaction of DL&#8208;Carnitine Hydrochloride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DL&#8208;Carnitine hydrochloride (DL) is incorporated into the perovskite/SnO2 interface for FACsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Oxygen vacancies and Sn&#8208;related defects are concurrently suppressed by the DL, while the DL&#8208;dimer yielded by the intermolecular esterification passivates Pb&#8208;related defects more efficiently than DL. Consequently, a DL&#8208;treated device achieves a record efficiency of 25.24% among all the reported FACsPbI3 PSCs to date.








Abstract
Judicious tailoring of the interface between the SnO2 electron&#8208;transport layer and the perovskite buried surface plays a pivotal role in obtaining highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a DL&#8208;carnitine hydrochloride (DL) is incorporated into the perovskite/SnO2 interface to suppress the defect&#8208;states density. A DL&#8208;dimer is obtained at the interface by an intermolecular esterification reaction. For the SnO2 film, the Cl&#8722; in the DL&#8208;dimer can passivate oxygen vacancies (VO) through electrostatic coupling, while the N in the DL&#8208;dimer can coordinate with the Sn4+ to passivate Sn&#8208;related defects. For the perovskite film, the DL&#8208;dimer can passivate FA+ defects via hydrogen bonding and Pb&#8208;related defects more efficiently than the DL monomer. Upon DL&#8208;dimer modification, the interfacial defects are effectively passivated and the quality of the resultant perovskite film is improved. As a result, the DL&#8208;treated device achieves a gratifying open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20&#160;V and a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.24%, which is a record value among all the reported FACsPbI3 PSCs to date. In addition, the unencapsulated devices exhibit a charming stability, sustaining 99.20% and 90.00% of their initial PCEs after aging in air for 1200&#160;h and continuously operating at the maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h, respectively.

         <title>Restoration of Sinusoid Fenestrae Followed by Targeted Nanoassembly Delivery of an Anti&#8208;Fibrotic Agent Improves Treatment Efficacy in Liver Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liver fibrosis is accompanied by the capillarization of liver sinusoid endothelial cells, which decreases the accessibility of therapeutics in the blood to hepatic stellate cells in the Disse space. A combinational strategy of sinusoid fenestrae restoration followed by HSC&#8208;targeted delivery of an anti&#8208;fibrotic agent is developed for liver fibrosis treatment. The strategy ameliorates fibrosis in the liver fibrosis murine models.








Abstract
During the onset of liver fibrosis, capillarized liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) limit substance exchange between the blood and the Disse space, further accelerating hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation and fibrosis progression. Limited accessibility of therapeutics to the Disse space is often overlooked and remains a major bottleneck for HSCs&#8208;targeted therapy in liver fibrosis. Here, an integrated systemic strategy for liver fibrosis treatment is reported, utilizing pretreatment with the soluble guanylate cyclase stimulator, riociguat, followed by insulin growth factor 2 receptor&#8208;mediated targeted delivery of the anti&#8208;fibrosis agent, JQ1, via peptide&#8208;nanoparticles (IGNP&#8208;JQ1). The riociguat reversed the liver sinusoid capillarization to maintain a relatively normal LSECs porosity, thus facilitating the transport of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 through the liver sinusoid endothelium wall and enhancing the accumulation of IGNP&#8208;JQ1 in the Disse space. IGNP&#8208;JQ1 is then selectively taken up by activated HSCs, inhibiting their proliferation and decreasing collagen deposition in the liver. The combined strategy results in significant fibrosis resolution in carbon tetrachloride&#8208;induced fibrotic mice as well as methionine&#8208;choline&#8208;deficient&#8208;diet&#8208;induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) mice. The work highlights the key role of LSECs in therapeutics transport through the liver sinusoid. The strategy of restoring LSECs fenestrae by riociguat represents a promising approach for liver fibrosis treatment.

Compared with its excellent optoelectronic properties, the good dielectric performance of metal halide perovskite rarely comes into notice. Here, we demonstrate a bi&#8208;functional perovskite&#8208;based photovoltaic detector capable of two&#8208;wavelength demultiplexing. In our BP/Perovskite/MoS2 structured photodetector, the comprehensive utilization of the photosensitive and dielectric properties of 2D perovskite allows the device to work in different modes. The fabricated device shows normal continuous photo response under 405&#8208;nm illumination, while it shows a transient spike response to visible light with longer wavelengths. The linear dynamic range, rise/decay time, and self&#8208;powered responsivity under 405&#160;nm radiation can reach 100, 38 &#956;s/50 &#956;s, and 17.7&#160;mA/W, respectively. We demonstrate the transient spike photocurrent with long wavelength exposure is related to the illumination intensity and can coexist with normal photo response. Two waveband&#8208;dependent signals can be identified and used to reflect more information at the same time. This work provides a new strategy for multispectral detection and demultiplexing, which can be used to improve data&#8208;transfer rates and encrypted communications. This work mode could inspire more multispectral photodetectors with different stacked 2D materials, especially to the optoelectronic application of the wide bandgap, high dielectric photo&#8208;sensitive materials.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Perovskite Photovoltaics Enabled by Solution&#8208;Processed Carbon Electrode</title>

         <dc:description>
A new conductive carbon electrode ink is developed specifically for compatibility with a low&#8208;temperature perovskite device stack. Filling a crucial gap in the ability to mass manufacture highly efficient perovskite photovoltaics and achieving a stabilized efficiency of 10.8%, all layers of the device stack including the electrode are roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll slot&#8208;die coated.








Abstract
Perovskite photovoltaics have shown great promise in device efficiency but also the promise of scalability through solution&#8208;processed manufacture. Efforts to scale perovskites have been taken&#160;through printable mesoporous scaffolds and slot die coating of flexible substrates roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R). However, to date there has been no demonstration of entirely R2R&#8208;coated devices due to the lack of a compatible solution&#8208;processable back electrode; instead,&#160;high&#8208;value evaporated metal contacts are employed as a post process. Here, in this study, the combination of a low&#8208;temperature device structure and R2R&#8208;compatible solution formulations is employed to make a fully R2R printable device architecture overcoming interlayer incompatibilities and recombination losses. Therefore, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p device structure of SnO2/perovskite/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)/carbon is employed to form an ohmic contact between a p&#8208;type semiconductor and printable carbon electrode. In particular, the results show that the small&#8208;scale device efficiencies of 13&#8211;14% are achieved, matching the device performance of evaporated gold electrodes. Also, this entirely R2R&#8208;coated perovskite prototype represents a game changer, reaching over 10% (10.8) stabilized power conversion efficiency with unencapsulated long&#8208;term stability retaining 84% of its original efficiency over 1000 h under 70% RH and 25 &#176;C.

         <title>Organic Chiroptical Detector Favoring Circularly Polarized Light Detecting from Near&#8208;Infrared to Ultraviolet and Magnetic Field Amplifying Dissymmetry in Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Circularly polarized light detecting has attracted growing attention because of its unique application in security surveillance and quantum optics. Here, through designing chiral polymer as a donor, a high&#8208;performance circularly polarized light detector was fabricated successfully enabling the detection from ultraviolet (300&#160;nm) to near&#8208;infrared (1100&#160;nm). The chiroptical detector presents an excellent ability to distinguish the right&#8208;handed and left&#8208;handed circularly polarized light, where dissymmetries in detectivity, responsivity, and electric current are obtained and then optimized. The dissymmetry in electric current can be increased from 0.18 to 0.23 once applying an external magnetic field. This is a very rare report on the dissymmetry tunability by external field in chiroptical detectors. Moreover, the chirality generated orbital angular momentum is one of the key factors determining the performance of circularly polarized light detection. Overall, the organic chiroptical detector presents excellent stability in detecting, which provides a great potential for future flexible and compact integrated platforms.

         <title>Bioinspired Processing: Complex Coacervates as Versatile Inks for 3D Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
3D bioprinting is a powerful fabrication technique in biomedical engineering, which is currently limited by the number of available materials that meet all physicochemical and cytocompatibility requirements for biomaterial inks. Inspired by the key role of coacervations in the extrusion and spinning of many natural materials, hyaluronic acid&#8208;chitosan complex coacervates are proposed here as tunable biomaterial inks. Complex coacervates are obtained through an associative liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation driven by electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged macromolecules. They offer bioactive properties as well as facile modulation of their mechanical properties through mild physicochemical changes in the environment, rendering them attractive for 3D bioprinting. Fine&#8208;tuning the salt concentration, pH, and molecular weight of the constituent polymers results in biomaterial inks that are printable in air and water. The biomaterial ink, initially a viscoelastic fluid, transitions into a viscoelastic solid upon printing due to dehydration (for printing in air) or due to a change in pH and ionic composition (for printing in water). Consequently, scaffolds printed using the complex coacervate inks are stable without the need for post&#8208;printing processing. Cell culture scaffolds fabricated in this way are cytocompatible and show long&#8208;term topological stability. These results pave the way to a new class of easy&#8208;to&#8208;handle tunable biomaterials for biofabrication.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction from Tuneable Naphthalene&#8208;Based Porous Polyimide Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A series of porous polyimides (pPIs) have been synthesised and their surface areas and pore sizes optimised by the previously reported Bristol&#8208;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) approach. We demonstrate how this approach can be used to tune the porous network properties to target and tune their ability to capture CO2. Once optimised, these porous organic frameworks were utilised, for the first time, as electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2. The excellent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the conversion of CO2 to formate (91%) and methanol (85%) present exciting opportunities for the generation of useful fuels and feedstocks from CO2. In addition, the ability to directly address and select the conversion products through tuning of the porous materials&#8217; properties highlights the potential of our approach, and more generally for a wide range of organic frameworks, as future metal&#8208;free CO2 reduction catalysts.

         <title>Cuproptosis Induced by ROS Responsive Nanoparticles with Elesclomol and Copper Combined with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cuproptosis is a new cell death that depends on copper (Cu) ionophores to transport Cu into cancer cells, which induces cell death. However, existing Cu ionophores are small molecules with a short blood half&#8208;life making it hard to transport enough Cu into cancer cells. Herein, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer (PHPM) was designed, which was used to co&#8208;encapsulate elesclomol (ES) and Cu to form nanoparticles (NP@ESCu). After entering cancer cells, ES and Cu, triggered by excessive intracellular ROS, were readily released. ES and Cu worked in a concerted way to not only kill cancer cells by cuproptosis, but also induce immune responses. In vitro, the ability of NP@ESCu to efficiently transport Cu and induce cuproptosis was investigated. In addition, the change in the transcriptomes of cancer cells treated with NP@ESCu was explored by RNA&#8208;Seq. In vivo, NP@ESCu was found to induce cuproptosis in the mice model with subcutaneous bladder cancer, reprograming the tumor microenvironment. Additionally, NP@ESCu was further combined with anti&#8208;programmed cell death protein ligand&#8208;1 antibody (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). This study provides the first report of combining nanomedicine that can induce cuproptosis with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 for enhanced cancer therapy, thereby providing a novel strategy for future cancer therapy.

         <title>Silk fibroin and sericin differentially potentiate the paracrine and regenerative functions of stem cells through multiomics analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, are attractive biomaterials with great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, their biochemical interactions with stem cells remain unclear. In this study, we employed multiomics to obtain a global view of the cellular processes and pathways of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by SF and SS to discern cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions at an in&#8208;depth, high&#8208;throughput molecular level. Integrated RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis confirmed that SF and SS initiated widespread but distinct cellular responses and potentiated the paracrine functions of MSCs that regulate extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation through differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. These paracrine signals of MSCs stimulated by SF and SS effectively improved skin regeneration by regulating the behavior of multiple resident cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) in the skin wound microenvironment. Compared to SS, SF exhibited better immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, indicating its greater potential as a carrier material of MSCs for skin regeneration. This study provides comprehensive and reliable insights into the cellular interactions with SF and SS, enabling the future development of silk&#8208;based therapeutics for tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.

         <title>siRNA delivery against myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury mediated by reversibly camouflaged biomimetic nanocomplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
siRNA&#8208;mediated management of myocardial ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury is greatly hampered by the inefficient myocardial enrichment and cardiomyocyte transfection. Herein, nanocomplexes (NCs) reversibly camouflaged with platelet&#8208;macrophage hybrid membrane (HM) were developed to efficiently deliver Sav1 siRNA (siSav1) into cardiomyocytes, suppressing the Hippo pathway and inducing cardiomyocyte regeneration. The biomimetic BSPC@HM NCs consisted of a cationic nano&#8208;core assembled from a membrane&#8208;penetrating helical polypeptide (P&#8208;Ben) and siSav1, a charge&#8208;reversal intermediate layer of poly(L&#8208;lysine)&#8208;cis&#8208;aconitic acid (PC), and an outer shell of HM. Due to HM&#8208;mediated inflammation homing and microthrombus targeting, intravenously injected BSPC@HM NCs could efficiently accumulate in the IR&#8208;injured myocardium, where the acidic inflammatory microenvironment triggered charge reversal of PC to shed off both HM and PC layers and allow the penetration of the exposed P&#8208;Ben/siSav1 NCs into cardiomyocytes. In rats and pigs, BSPC@HM NCs remarkably down&#8208;regulated Sav1 in IR&#8208;injured myocardium, promoted myocardium regeneration, suppressed myocardial apoptosis, and recovered cardiac functions. This study reports a bio&#8208;inspired strategy to overcome the multiple systemic barriers against myocardial siRNA delivery, and holds profound potentials for gene therapy against cardiac injuries.

         <title>Thermodynamically Stable Dual&#8208;Modified LiF&amp;FeF3 layer Empowering Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes with Superior Cyclabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pushing the limit of cutoff potentials allows nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides to provide greater energy density and specific capacity whereas reducing thermodynamic and kinetic stability. Herein, a one&#8208;step dual&#8208;modified method is proposed for in situ synthesizing thermodynamically stable LiF&amp;FeF3 coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 surfaces by capturing lithium impurity on the surface to overcome the challenges suffered. The thermodynamically stabilized LiF&amp;FeF3 coating can effectively suppress the nanoscale structural degradation and the intergranular cracks. Meanwhile, the LiF&amp;FeF3 coating alleviates the outward migration of O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&lt;2), increases oxygen vacancy formation energies, and accelerates interfacial Li+ diffusion. Benefited from these, the electrochemical performance of LiF&amp;FeF3 modified materials is improved (83.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C), even under exertive operational conditions of elevated temperature (91.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 1C). This work demonstrates that the dual&#8208;modified strategy can simultaneously address the problems of interfacial instability and bulk structural degradation and represents significant progress in developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>Coupling probiotics with 2D CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets as tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive platform for precise NIR&#8208;II photodynamic therapy</title>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising cancer treatment approach with superior advantages. However, it remains a ground challenge to develop tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive photosensitizers (PSs) for tumor&#8208;targeting precise PDT. Herein, we report the coupling Lactobacillus acidophilus probiotics with 2D CoCuMo&#8208;layered double hydroxide nanosheets (LA&amp;LDH) as a TME&#8208;responsive platform for precise NIR&#8208;II PDT. The CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets loaded on LA can be transformed from crystalline into amorphous one through etching by the LA metabolite&#8208;enabled low pH and over&#8208;expressed glutathione. The TME&#8208;induced in&#8208;situ amorphization of CoCuMo&#8208;LDH nanosheets can boost its photodynamic activity for singlet oxygen (1O2) generation under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation with the relative 1O2 quantum yield of 1.06, which is the highest among previously reported NIR&#8208;excited PSs. In vitro and in vivo assays prove that the LA&amp;LDH can effectively achieve complete cell apoptosis and tumor eradication under 1270&#160;nm laser irradiation. This study proves that the probiotics can be used as a tumor&#8208;targeting platform for highly efficient precise NIR&#8208;II PDT.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Bipolar Photoresponse with Amplified Photocurrents in Electrolyte&#8208;Assisted Bipolar p&#8208;n Junction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The p&#8208;n junction with bipolar characteristics sets the fundamental unit to build electronics while its unique rectification behavior constrains the degree of carrier tunability for expanded functionalities. Herein, we report a bipolar&#8208;junction photoelectrode employed with gallium nitride (GaN) p&#8208;n homojunction nanowire array that operates in electrolyte, demonstrating bipolar photoresponse controlled by different wavelengths of light. Significantly, with rational decoration of a ruthenium&#8208;oxides (RuOx) layer on nanowires guided by theoretical modeling, the resulted RuOx/p&#8208;n GaN photoelectrode exhibits unambiguously boosted bipolar photoresponse by an enhancement of 775% and 3000% for positive and negative photocurrents, respectively, compared to the pristine nanowires. The loading of RuOx layer on nanowire surface optimizes surface band bending which facilitates charge transfer across the GaN/electrolyte interface, meanwhile promoting the efficiency of redox reaction for both hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction which corresponds to the negative and positive photocurrents, respectively. Finally, a dual&#8208;band optical communication system incorporated with such photoelectrode is constructed with using only one photoelectrode to decode dual&#8208;channel signals with encrypted property. The proposed bipolar device architecture presents a viable route to manipulate the carrier dynamics for the development of a plethora of multi&#8208;functional optoelectronic devices for future sensing, communication, and imaging systems.

         <title>Effect of Phosphorus Modulation in Iron Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Peroxidase Mimicking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D&#160;phosphorus&#8208;doped single&#8208;atom Fe nanowires are designed to mimic peroxidase&#8208;like activity. The mechanism of phosphorus modulation via long&#8208;range interaction for increasing catalytic activity is fully analyzed. The designed single&#8208;atom catalyst exhibits good sensitivity in an enzyme&#8208;cascade sensor platform for colorimetric acetylcholine sensing. This work provides a strategy for creating enzyme&#8208;like single&#8208;atom catalysts and replacing natural enzymes in biomedical applications.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activity, owing to their well&#8208;defined isolated iron active sites on the carbon substrate, which effectively mimic the structure of natural peroxidase's active center. To further meet the requirements of diverse biosensing applications, SAC POD&#8208;like activity still needs to be continuously enhanced. Herein, a phosphorus (P) heteroatom is introduced to boost the POD&#8208;like activity of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs. A 1D&#160;carbon nanowire (FeNCP/NW) catalyst with enriched Fe&#8211;N4 active sites is designed and synthesized, and P atoms are doped in the carbon matrix to affect the Fe center through long&#8208;range interaction. The experimental results show that the P&#8208;doping process can boost the POD&#8208;like activity more than the non&#8208;P&#8208;doped one, with excellent selectivity and stability. The mechanism analysis results show that the introduction of P into SAC can greatly enhance POD&#8208;like activity initially, but its effect becomes insignificant with increasing amount of P. As a proof of concept, FeNCP/NW is employed in an enzyme cascade platform for highly sensitive colorimetric detection of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.

         <title>An Efficient High&#8208;Entropy Perovskite&#8208;Type Air Electrode for Reversible Oxygen Reduction and Water Splitting in Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>

A high&#8208;entropy Pr0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2La0.2Ca0.2CoO3&#8722;&#948; with highly enhanced activity and structural stability is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, demonstrating encouraging performances in the dual modes of fuel cell and electrolysis cell.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) are emerging as ideal devices for highly efficient energy conversion (generating electricity) and storage (producing H2) at intermediate temperatures (400&#8211;700&#160;&#176;C). However, their commercialization is largely hindered by the development of highly efficient air electrodes for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions. Here, the findings in the design of a highly active and durable air electrode are reported: high&#8208;entropy Pr0.2Ba0.2Sr0.2La0.2Ca0.2CoO3&#8722;&#948; (HE&#8208;PBSLCC), which exhibits impressive activity and stability for oxygen reduction and water&#8208;splitting reactions, as confirmed by electrochemical characterizations and structural analysis. When used as an air electrode of R&#8208;PCEC, the HE&#8208;PBSLCC achieves encouraging performances in dual modes of fuel cells (FCs) and electrolysis cells (ECs) at 650&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating a maximum power density of 1.51 W cm&#8722;2 in FC mode, and a current density of &#8722;2.68 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V in EC mode. Furthermore, the cells display good operational durabilities in FC and EC modes for over 270 and 500 h, respectively, and promising cycling durability for 70 h with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies. This study offers an effective strategy for the design of active and durable air electrodes for efficient oxygen reduction and water splitting.

         <title>Sulfide&#8208;Bridged Covalent Quinoxaline Frameworks for Lithium&#8211;Organosulfide Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox activity of covalent sulfide bridging and chelating ability of quinoxaline nodes in covalent organic frameworks offer dual active sites for a novel lithium&#8211;organosulfide battery. This shows negligible polysulfide shuttle in comparison with typical sulfur cathodes in the lithium&#8211;sulfur battery. Experimental and computational elucidation indicate a reversible mechanism.








Abstract
The chelating ability of quinoxaline cores and the redox activity of organosulfide bridges in layered covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer dual active sites for reversible lithium (Li)&#8208;storage. The designed COFs combining these properties feature disulfide and polysulfide&#8208;bridged networks showcasing an intriguing Li&#8208;storage mechanism, which can be considered as a lithium&#8211;organosulfide (Li&#8211;OrS) battery. The experimental&#8211;computational elucidation of three quinoxaline COFs containing systematically enhanced sulfur atoms in sulfide bridging demonstrates fast kinetics during Li interactions with the quinoxaline core. Meanwhile, bilateral covalent bonding of sulfide bridges to the quinoxaline core enables a redox&#8208;mediated reversible cleavage of the sulfur&#63743;sulfur bond and the formation of covalently anchored lithium&#8211;sulfide chains or clusters during Li&#8208;interactions, accompanied by a marked reduction of Li&#8211;polysulfide (Li&#8211;PS) dissolution into the electrolyte, a frequent drawback of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. The electrochemical behavior of model compounds mimicking the sulfide linkages of the COFs and operando Raman studies on the framework structure unravels the reversibility of the profound Li&#8208;ion&#8211;organosulfide interactions. Thus, integrating redox&#8208;active organic&#8208;framework materials with covalently anchored sulfides enables a stable Li&#8211;OrS battery mechanism which shows benefits over a typical Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>Improved Liquid Collection on a Dual&#8208;Asymmetric Superhydrophilic Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on the shell&#8208;like superhydrophilic 3D channels, here a spontaneous, directional, adaptive, and gravity&#8208;independent fluid collecting process is realized. The further integration of a radiative layer can improve steam collection, proving a potential application in water reusage.








Abstract
Manipulating fluid with an open channel provides a promising strategy to simplify the current systems. Nevertheless, spontaneous on&#8208;surface fluid transport with large flux, high speed, and long distance remains challenging. Inspired by scallop shells, here a shell&#8208;like superhydrophilic origami (S&#8208;SLO) with multiple&#8208;paratactic and dual&#8208;asymmetric channels is presented to improve fluid collection. The origami channel can capture various types of liquids, including droplets, flow, and steam, and then transport collected liquid unidirectionally. The S&#8208;SLO with 2&#160;mm depth can reach maximum flux of 450&#160;mL&#160;h&#8722;1, which is five times the capacity of a flat patterned surface with similar dimension. To diversify the function of such interface, the SLO is further integrated with a superhydrophobic zirconium carbide/silicone coating for enhanced condensation via the collaboration of directional fluid manipulation and a radiative cooling layer. Compared with the unmodified parallel origami, the shell&#8208;like origami with a radiative cooling layer shows a 56% improvement in condensate efficiency as well as the directional liquid drainage. This work demonstrates a more accessible design for the optimization of on&#8208;surface fluid control, and the improved performance of liquid transport should extend the applications of bioinspired fluid&#8208;manipulating interfaces.

         <title>A Hierarchical Structured Fiber Device Remodeling the Acidic Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Acidic microenvironment of tumor significantly reduces the anti&#8208;tumor effect of immunotherapy. Herein, we developed a hierarchically structured fiber device as a local drug delivery system for remodeling the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve the therapeutic effect of immunotherapy. Proton pump inhibitors in the fiber matrix could be sustainedly released to inhibit the efflux of intracellular H+ from tumor cells, resulting in the remodeling of the acidic TME. The targeted micelles and M1 macrophage membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles in internal cavities of fiber could induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and phenotypic transformation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), respectively. The relief of the acidity in the TME further promoted ICD and the polarization of TAMs, alleviating the immunosuppressive microenvironment and synergistically enhancing the antitumor immune response. In vivo results revealed this local drug delivery system restore the pH value of TME from 6.8 to 7.2 and exhibit an excellent immunotherapeutic effect.

         <title>Molecular engineering metal&#8208;organic frameworks as efficient electrochemical catalysis for water oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, we design a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan&#8208;metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF). The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)&#8208;MOF due to the Ni&#8208;S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electro&#8208;conductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)&#8208;MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non&#8208;thiol (e.g., 1,4&#8208;benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)&#8208;MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate&#8208;limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron&#8208;substituted NiFe(DMBD)&#8208;MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.

&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic framework (MOF) solids with their variable functionalities are relevant for energy conversion technologies. However, the development of electroactive and stable MOFs for electrocatalysis still faces challenges. Here, we design a molecularly engineered MOF system featuring a 2D coordination network based on mercaptan-metal links (e.g., nickel, as for Ni(DMBD)-MOF). The crystal structure is solved from microcrystals by continuous rotation electron diffraction (cRED) technique. Computational results indicate a metallic electronic structure of Ni(DMBD)-MOF due to the Ni-S coordination, highlighting the effective design of the thiol ligand for enhancing electro-conductivity. Additionally, both experimental and theoretical studies indicate that (DMBD)-MOF offers advantages in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) over non-thiol (e.g., 1,4-benzene dicarboxylic acid) analog (BDC)-MOF, because it poses fewer energy barriers during the rate-limiting *O intermediate formation step. Iron-substituted NiFe(DMBD)-MOF achieves a current density of 100 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a small overpotential of 280&#160;mV, indicating a new MOF platform for efficient OER catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High Performance Transparent Silver Grid Electrodes for Organic Photovoltaics Fabricated by Selective Metal Condensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report silver grid electrodes on glass and flexible plastic substrates with performance that exceeds that of commercial indium&#8208;tin oxide (ITO) coated glass and show their suitability as a drop&#8208;in replacement for ITO glass in solution processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs). When supported on flexible plastic substrates these electrodes are stable towards repeated bending through a small radius of curvature over tens of thousands of cycles. The grid electrodes are fabricated by the unconventional approach of condensation coefficient modulation using a perfluorinated polymer shown to be far superior to the other compounds used for this purpose to date. The very narrow line&#8208;width and small grid pitch that can be achieved also opens the door to the possibility of using grid electrodes in OPVs without a conducting PEDOT:PSS layer to span the gaps between grid&#8208;lines.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With Near&#8208;Unity Internal Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) commonly comprise a multilayer stack including charge&#8208;transport and charge&#8208; and exciton&#8208;blocking layers, to confine charge recombination to the emissive layer. Here, we demonstrate a highly simplified single&#8208;layer blue&#8208;emitting OLED based on thermally activated delayed fluorescence with the emitting layer simply sandwiched between ohmic contacts consisting of a polymeric conducting anode and a metal cathode. The single&#8208;layer OLED exhibits an external quantum efficiency of 27.7% with minor roll&#8208;off at high brightness. The internal quantum efficiency approaches unity, demonstrating that highly simplified single&#8208;layer OLEDs without confinement layers can achieve state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance, while greatly reducing the complexity of the design, fabrication, and device analysis.

         <title>Highly Selective Transformation of Biomass Derivatives to Valuable Chemicals by Single&#8208;Atom Photocatalyst Ni/TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct light&#8208;driven glycerol conversion to valuable chemicals under mild conditions is not only of scientific significance, but also of economic interest. A highly selective photocatalyst is prepared for the transformation of glycerol to the high&#8208;value product glycolaldehyde, which is composed of nickel single atoms confined on TiO2, presenting nearly three times higher turnover number than NiOx&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalysts.








Abstract
Selective C&#63743;C cleavage of the biomass derivative glycerol under mild conditions is recognized as a promising yet challenging synthesis route to produce value&#8208;added chemicals. Here, a highly selective catalyst for the transformation of glycerol to the high&#8208;value product glycolaldehyde is presented, which is composed of nickel single atoms confined to the surface of titanium dioxide. Driven by light, the catalyst operates under ambient conditions using air as a green oxidant. The optimized catalyst shows a selectivity of over 60% to glycolaldehyde, resulting in 1058 &#181;mol&#160;gCat&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 production rate, and &#8776;3 times higher turnover number than NiOx&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;decorated TiO2 photocatalyst. Diverse operando and in situ spectroscopies unveil the unique function of the Ni single atom, which can significantly promote oxygen adsorption, work as an electron sink, and accelerate the production of superoxide radicals, thereby improving the selectivity toward glycolaldehyde over other by&#8208;products.

         <title>A Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Biomimetic Nanoplatform Enhances Anti&#8208;Leukemia Immunity via Synchronizing DNA Demethylation and RNA Hypermethylation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bimetallic metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;based biomimetic nanoplatform as a &#8220;nano&#8208;epidrug&#8221; (AFMMB) is synthesized for improving anti&#8208;leukemia immunity via dual targeting of DNA and RNA methylation. AFMMB selectively targets leukemic cells and induces autophagy. AFMMB increases the antigenicity of leukemia cells via upregulation of MHC&#8208;I and downregulation of PD&#8208;L1, which in turn enhances their recognition and killing by T cells.








Abstract
Epigenetic&#8208;alterations&#8208;mediated antigenicity reducing in leukemic blasts (LBs) is one of the critical mechanisms of immune escape and resistance to T&#8208;cell&#8208;based immunotherapy. Herein, a bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based biomimetic nanoplatform (termed as AFMMB) that consists of a DNA hypomethylating agent, a leukemia stem cell (LSC) membrane, and pro&#8208;autophagic peptide is fabricated. These AFMMB particles selectively target not only LBs but also LSCs due to the homing effect and immune compatibility of the LSC membrane, and induce autophagy by binding to the Golgi&#8208;apparatus&#8208;associated protein. The autophagy&#8208;triggered dissolution of AFMMB releases active components, resulting in the restoration of the stimulator of interferon genes pathway by inhibiting DNA methylation, upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class&#8208;I molecules, and induction of RNA&#8208;methylation&#8208;mediated decay of programmed cell death protein ligand transcripts. These dual epigenetic changes eventually enhance T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated immune response due to increased antigenicity of leukemic cells. AFMMB also can suppress growth and metastases of solid tumor, which&#160;was&#160;suggestive of a pan&#8208;cancer effect. These findings demonstrate that AFMMB may serve as a promising new nanoplatform for dual epigenetic therapy against cancer and warrants clinical validation.

Flexible polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) based on PNFFN&#8208;FDTE exhibit ambipolar transport characteristic under ambient conditions with the maximum electron mobility of 16.67 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest electron&#8208;transport performance for PFETs reported to date.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors with mobilities exceeding 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, especially ambipolar and n&#8208;type polymer semiconductors, are still rare, although they are of great importance for fabricating polymer field&#8208;effect transistors (PFETs) toward commercial high&#8208;grade electronics. Herein, two novel donor&#8722;acceptor copolymers, PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE, are designed and synthesized based on the electron&#8208;deficient bisisoindigo (NFFN) and electron&#8208;rich dithienylethylenes (DTE or FDTE). The copolymer PNFFN&#8208;DTE, containing NFFN and DTE, possesses a partially locked polymeric conjugated backbone, whereas PNFFN&#8208;FDTE, containing NFFN and FDTE, has a fully locked one. Fluorine atoms in FDTE not only induce the formation of additional CH&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;F hydrogen bonds, but also lower frontier molecular orbitals for PNFFN&#8208;FDTE. Both PNFFN&#8208;DTE and PNFFN&#8208;FDTE form more ordered molecular packing in thin films prepared from a polymer solution in bicomponent solvent containing 1,2&#8208;dichlorobenzene (DCB) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (with volume ratio of 99.2/0.8) than pure DCB. The two copolymers&#8208;based flexible PFETs exhibit ambipolar charge&#8208;transport properties. Notably, the bicomponent solvent&#8208;processed PNFFN&#8208;FDTE&#8208;based PFETs afford a high electron mobility of 16.67 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is the highest electron&#8208;transport mobility for PFETs reported so far. The high electron mobility of PNFFN&#8208;FDTE is attributed to its fully locked conjugated backbone, dense molecular packing, and much matched LUMO energy level.

         <title>Artificial Muscles and Soft Robotic Devices for Treatment of End&#8208;Stage Heart Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the present state and future direction of soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart, focusing on electrothermally artificial heart muscles. The current state of the ventricular assist devices and the key factors for the development of a full soft robotic ventricular assist device were discussed.








Abstract
Medical soft robotics constitutes a rapidly developing field in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with a promising future for millions of patients suffering from heart failure worldwide. Herein, the present state and future direction of artificial muscle&#8208;based soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart are reviewed, focusing on the emerging electrothermally artificial heart muscles (AHMs). Artificial muscle powered soft robotic devices can mimic the action of complex biological systems such as heart compression and twisting. These artificial muscles possess the ability to undergo complex deformations, aiding cardiac function while maintaining a limited weight and use of space. Two very promising candidates for artificial muscles are electrothermally actuated AHMs and biohybrid actuators using living cells or tissue embedded with artificial structures. Electrothermally actuated AHMs have demonstrated superior force generation while creating the prospect for fully soft robotic actuated ventricular assist devices. This review will critically analyze the limitations of currently available devices and discuss opportunities and directions for future research. Last, the properties of the cardiac muscle are reviewed and compared with those of different materials suitable for mechanical cardiac compression.

         <title>Printable Epsilon&#8208;Type Structure Transistor Arrays with Highly Reliable Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) constructed by printed epsilon&#8208;type&#8208;structure indium tin oxide transistor arrays based on a modified coffee&#8208;ring structure are achieved, performing with near&#8208;ideal entropy, uniqueness, reliability, and low power consumption. Additionally, the PUFs are secure against powerful machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based attacks without any postprocessing. The printed epsilon&#8208;type structured transistor provides a printable, simple strategy for high&#8208;equality and large&#8208;scale hardware secure primitive.








Abstract
Printed electronics promises to drive the future data&#8208;intensive technologies, with its potential to fabricate novel devices over a large area with low cost on nontraditional substrates. In these emerging technologies, there exists a large digital information flow, which requires secure communication and authentication. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) offer a promising built&#8208;in hardware&#8208;security system comparable to biometrical data, which can be constructed by device&#8208;specific intrinsic variations in the additive manufacturing process of active devices. However, printed PUFs typically exploit the inherent variation in layer thickness and roughness of active devices. The current in devices with enough significant changes to increase the robustness to external environment noise is still a challenge. Here, printable epsilon&#8208;type&#8208;structure indium tin oxide transistor arrays are demonstrated to construct high&#8208;reliability PUFs by modifying the coffee&#8208;ring structure. The epsilon&#8208;type structure improves the printing scalability, film quality, and device reliability. Furthermore, the print&#8208;induced uncertainty along the channel thickness and length can lead to changes in the carrier concentration. Notably, the randomly distributed printing droplets in a small area significantly increase this uncertainty. As a result, the PUFs exhibit near&#8208;ideal uniformity, uniqueness, randomness, and reliability. Additionally, the PUFs are resilient against machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based attacks with a prediction accuracy of only 55% without postprocessing.

         <title>Thickness&#8208;Dependent Topological Hall Effect in 2D Cr5Si3 Nanosheets with Noncollinear Magnetic Phase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thickness&#8208;dependent magnetic order in 2D Cr5Si3 nanosheets is herein studied. The thickness&#8208;dependent topological Hall effect and its relation to the observed perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are investigated. At the same time, Cr5Si3 nanosheets that are compatible with the complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor&#160;technology are synthesized through the chemical vapor deposition setup. It can be used for reference for the growth of other 2D silicides.








Abstract
Antiferromagnets with noncollinear spin order are expected to exhibit unconventional electromagnetic response, such as spin Hall effects, chiral abnormal, quantum Hall effect, and topological Hall effect. Here, 2D thickness&#8208;controlled and high&#8208;quality Cr5Si3 nanosheets that are compatible with the complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition method. The angular dependence of electromagnetic transport properties of Cr5Si3 nanosheets is investigated using a physical property measurement system, and an obvious topological Hall effect (THE) appears at a large tilted magnetic field, which results from the noncollinear magnetic structure of the Cr5Si3 nanosheet. The Cr5Si3 nanosheets exhibit distinct thickness&#8208;dependent perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), and the THE only emerges in the specific thickness range with moderate PMA. This work provides opportunities for exploring fundamental spin&#8208;related physical mechanisms of noncollinear antiferromagnet in ultrathin limit.

         <title>An Engineered Nanosugar Enables Rapid and Sustained Glucose&#8208;Responsive Insulin Delivery in Diabetic Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanosugar platform is engineered to attain glucose&#8208;responsive and sustained release of insulin. The biodegradable platform enables rapid and extended glucose control&#160;in type 1 diabetes mouse models, upon a single subcutaneous injection. The architecture and morphology of the nanocomplexes are tailored to control the&#160;bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics of insulin&#160;through the direct blood capillaries absorption and the lymphatic&#160;trafficking.








Abstract
Glucose&#8208;responsive insulin&#8208;delivery platforms that are sensitive to dynamic glucose concentration fluctuations and provide both rapid and prolonged insulin release have great potential to control hyperglycemia and avoid hypoglycemia diabetes. Here, biodegradable and charge&#8208;switchable phytoglycogen nanoparticles capable of glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin release are engineered. The nanoparticles are &#8220;nanosugars&#8221; bearing glucose&#8208;sensitive phenylboronic acid groups and amine moieties that allow effective complexation with insulin (&#8776;95% loading capacity) to form nanocomplexes. A single subcutaneous injection of nanocomplexes shows a rapid and efficient response to a glucose challenge in two distinct diabetic mouse models, resulting in optimal blood glucose levels (below 200&#160;mg dL&#8211;1) for up to 13&#160;h. The morphology of the nanocomplexes is found to be key to controlling rapid and extended glucose&#8208;regulated insulin delivery in vivo. These studies reveal that the injected nanocomplexes enabled efficient insulin release in the mouse, with optimal bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles. These results highlight a promising strategy for the development of a glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery system based on a natural and biodegradable nanosugar.

A single subcutaneous injection of nanocomplexes shows a rapid and efficient response to a glucose challenge in two distinct diabetic mouse models, resulting in optimal blood glucose levels (below 200&#160;mg dL&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) for up to 13&#160;h. The morphology of the nanocomplexes is found to be key to controlling rapid and extended glucose-regulated insulin delivery in vivo. These studies reveal that the injected nanocomplexes enabled efficient insulin release in the mouse, with optimal bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles. These results highlight a promising strategy for the development of a glucose-responsive insulin delivery system based on a natural and biodegradable nanosugar.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Mediated Cytocompatible Formation of Supramolecular Hydrogels with Self&#8208;evolving Macropores for 3D Multicellular Spheroid Culture</title>

Abstract
Coacervation driven liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation of biopolymers has aroused considerable attention for diverse applications, especially for the construction of microstructured polymeric materials. Herein, a coacervate&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogel transition strategy is developed to create macroporous hydrogels (MPH), which was formed via the coacervation process of supramolecular assemblies (SA) built by the host&#8211;guest complexation between &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin and anthracene dimer. The weak and reversible supramolecular crosslinks endow the SA with liquid&#8208;like rheological properties, which facilitate the formation of SA&#8208;derived macroporous coacervates and the subsequent transition to MPH (pore size &#8776; 100&#160;&#956;m). The excellent structural dynamics (derived from SA) and the cytocompatible void&#8208;forming process of MPH can better accommodate the dramatic volumetric expansion associated with colony growth of encapsulated multicellular spheroids compared with the non&#8208;porous static hydrogel with similar mechanical properties. The findings of this work not only provide valuable guidance to the design of biomaterials with self&#8208;evolving structures but also present a promising strategy for 3D multicellular spheroid culture and other diverse biomedical applications.

         <title>Efficient and Robust Molecular Solar Thermal Fabric for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel MOST fabric with high energy&#8208;storage capacity and robustness is demonstrated for personal thermal management (PTM). Based on a MOST microcapsule with deep&#8208;UV&#8208;filter shell and encapsulated azopyrazole molecules, the MOST fabric displays ideal energy&#8208;storage density up to 2.5&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 and high robustness in rechargeability, washing, and rubbing.








Abstract
Molecular solar thermal (MOST) materials, which can efficiently capture solar energy and release it as heat on demand, are promising candidates for future personal thermal management (PTM) applications, preferably in the form of fabrics. However, developing MOST fabrics with high energy&#8208;storage capacity and stable working performance remains a significant challenge because of the low energy density of the molecular materials and their leakage from the fabric. Here, an efficient and robust MOST fabric for PTM using azopyrazole&#8208;containing microcapsules with a deep&#8208;UV&#8208;filter shell is reported. The MOST fabric, which can co&#8208;harvest solar and thermal energy, achieves efficient photocharging and photo&#8208;discharging (&gt;90% photoconversion), a high energy density of 2.5&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, and long&#8208;term storage sustainability at month scale. Moreover, it can undergo multiple cycles of washing, rubbing, and recharging without significant loss of energy&#8208;storage capacity. This MOST microcapsule strategy is easily used for the scalable production of a MOST fabric for solar thermal moxibustion. This achievement offers a promising route for the application of wearable MOST materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance and robustness in PTM.

         <title>Improved Carrier Management Via a Multifunctional Modifier for High&#8208;Quality Low&#8208;Bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb Perovskites and Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) hold great promise in terms of ultrahigh efficiency, low manufacturing cost, and flexibility, stepping forward to the next&#8208;generation photovoltaics. However, their further development is hampered by the relatively low performance of low&#8208;bandgap (LBG) tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Improving the carrier management including suppressing trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination and promoting carrier transfer is of great significance to enhance the performance of Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs. Herein, we report a carrier management strategy for using cysteine hydrochloride (CysHCl) simultaneously as a bulky passivator and a surface anchoring agent for Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite. CysHCl processing effectively reduces trap density and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, enabling the growth of high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite with greatly improved carrier diffusion length of &gt; 8&#160;&#956;m. Furthermore, the electron transfer at the perovskite/C60 interface is accelerated due to the formation of surface dipoles and favorable energy band bending. As a result, these advances enable the demonstration of champion efficiency of 22.15% for CysHCl&#8208;processed LBG Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with remarkable enhancement in both open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor. When paired with a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite subcell, we further demonstrate a certified 25.7%&#8208;efficient all&#8208;perovskite monolithic tandem device.

         <title>Fluorinated Li10GeP2S12 enables stable all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The instability of Li10GeP2S12 towards moisture and lithium metal are two challenges for its application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. In this work, Li10GeP2S12 is fluorinated to form a LiF coated core&#8208;shell solid electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm the hydrolysis mechanism of Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte, including H2O adsorption on Li atoms of Li10GeP2S12 and the subsequent PS43&#8722; dissociation affected by hydrogen bond. The hydrophobic LiF shell can reduce the adsorption site, thus resulting in superior moisture stability when exposing in 30% relative humidity air. Moreover, with LiF shell, Li10GeP2S12 shows one order lower electronic conductivity, which can significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth and reduce the side reaction between Li10GeP2S12 and lithium, realizing three times higher critical current density to 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled LiNbO3@LiCoO2/LiF@Li10GeP2S12/Li battery exhibits initial discharge capacity of 101.0 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 Alloyed Double Perovskite Nanoplatelets for Solution&#8208;Processed Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials with potential to be integrated into a wide range of optical and optoelectronic applications. Herein, we demonstrate the first synthesis of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In&#8208;Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self&#8208;trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs. Moreover, the NPLs exhibit good stability under ambient conditions and against polar solvents, which is ideal for all solution&#8208;processing of the materials in low&#8208;cost device manufacturing. We demonstrate the first solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;emitting diodes using the Cs2AgIn0.9Bi0.1Cl6 alloyed double perovskite NPLs as the sole emitting component, showing luminance maximum of 58&#160;cd/m2 and peak current efficiency of 0.013&#160;cd/A. Our study sheds light on morphological control and composition&#8208;property relationships of double perovskite nanocrystals, paving the way toward ultimate utilizations of lead&#8208;free perovskite materials in diverse sets of real&#8208;life applications.

Herein, we demonstrate the first synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgIn&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;1-x&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In-Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self-trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs. Moreover, the NPLs exhibit good stability under ambient conditions and against polar solvents, which is ideal for all solution-processing of the materials in low-cost device manufacturing. We demonstrate the first solution-processed light-emitting diodes using the Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;AgIn&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; alloyed double perovskite NPLs as the sole emitting component, showing luminance maximum of 58&#160;cd/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and peak current efficiency of 0.013&#160;cd/A. Our study sheds light on morphological control and composition-property relationships of double perovskite nanocrystals, paving the way toward ultimate utilizations of lead-free perovskite materials in diverse sets of real-life applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell Powered Integrated Fuel Conversion and Energy Storage Devices</title>

Abstract
Metal halide hybrid perovskites solar cell (PSCs) have received considerable attention over the past decade owing to their potential for low&#8208;cost, solution&#8208;processable, earth&#8208;abundant, and high&#8208;performance superiority, increasing power conversion efficiencies of up to 25.7%. Solar energy conversion into electricity is highly efficient and sustainable, but direct utilisation, storage, and poor energy diversity are difficult to achieve, resulting in a potential waste of resources. Considering its convenience and feasibility, converting solar energy into chemical fuels is regarded as a promising pathway for boosting energy diversity and expanding its utilisation. In addition, the energy conversion&#8208;storage integrated system can efficiently sequentially capture, convert, and store energy in electrochemical energy storage devices. However, a comprehensive overview focusing on PSC&#8208;self&#8208;driven integrated devices with a discussion of their development and limitations remains lacking. In this review, we focus on the development of representative configurations of emerging PSCs&#8208;based photo&#8208;electrochemical devices including self&#8208;charging power packs, unassisted solar water splitting/CO2 reduction. We also summarise the advanced progress in this field, including configuration design, key parameters, working principles, integration strategies, electrode materials, and their performance evaluations. Finally, scientific challenges and future perspectives for ongoing research in this field are presented.

         <title>Foldable RF Energy Harvesting System Based on Vertically Layered Metal Electrodes within a Single Sheet of Paper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) systems have emerged as a critical component for powering devices and replacing traditional batteries, with paper being one of the most promising substrates for use in flexible RFEH systems. However, previous paper&#8208;based electronics with optimized porosity, surface roughness, and hygroscopicity still face limitations in terms of the development of integrated foldable RFEH systems within a single sheet of paper. In the present study, a&#160;novel wax&#8208;printing control and water&#8208;based solution process are&#160;used to realize an integrated foldable RFEH systems within&#160;a single sheet of paper. The proposed paper&#8208;based&#160;device includes vertically layered&#160;foldable&#160;metal electrodes, a via&#8208;hole, and stable conductive patterns with a sheet resistance of less than 1 &#937; sq&#8722;1. The proposed RFEH system exhibits an RF/DC conversion efficiency of 60% and an operating voltage of 2.1&#160;V in 100 s at a distance of 50&#160;mm and a transmitted power of 50&#160;mW. The integrated RFEH system also demonstrates stable foldability, with RFEH performance maintained up to a folding angle of 150&#176;. Our single&#8208;sheet paper&#8208;based RFEH system thus has the potential for use in practical applications associated with the remote powering of wearable and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things devices and in paper electronics.

         <title>Rising of Dynamic Polyimide Materials: A Versatile Dielectric for Electrical and Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) are widely used in circuit components, electrical insulators, and power systems in modern electronic devices, large electrical appliances, and aerospace applications. Electrical/mechanical damage and atomic oxygen corrosion of materials are important factors that threaten reliability and service lifetime. Dynamic (self&#8208;healable, recyclable and degradable) PIs, a promising class of materials that successfully improve electrical/mechanical properties after damage, are anticipated to solve this issue. We share our viewpoints and perspectives on the status and future trends of dynamic PI based on a few existing documents. The main damage forms of PI dielectric materials in the application process are first introduced, and initial strategies and schemes to solve these problems are proposed. Fundamentally, the bottleneck issues faced by the development of dynamic PIs are indicated, and the relationship between various damage forms and the universality of the method is evaluated. The potential mechanism of the dynamic PI to deal with electrical damage is highlighted and several feasible prospective schemes to address electrical damage are discussed. We conclude by presenting a short outlook and future improvements to systems, challenges, and solutions of dynamic PI in electrical insulation. The summary of theory and practice should encourage policy development favoring energy conservation and environmental protection and promoting sustainability

         <title>Chemotaxis&#8208;guided Self&#8208;propelled Macrophage Motor for Targeted Treatment of Acute Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immune cells exhibit a great potential as carriers of nanomedicine, attributed to their high tolerance to internalized nanomaterials and targeted accumulation in inflammatory tissues. However, the premature efflux of internalized nanomedicine during systemic delivery and slow infiltration into inflammatory tissues have limited their translational applications. Herein, we report a motorized cell platform as a nanomedicine carrier for highly efficient accumulation and infiltration in the inflammatory lungs and effective treatment of acute pneumonia. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and adamantane respectively modified manganese dioxide nanoparticles are intracellularly self&#8208;assembled into large aggregates mediated via host&#8208;guest interactions, to effectively inhibit the efflux of nanoparticles, catalytically consume/deplete H2O2 to alleviate inflammation, and generate O2 to propel macrophage movement for rapid tissue infiltration. With curcumin loaded into MnO2 nanoparticles, macrophages carry the intracellular nano&#8208;assemblies rapidly into the inflammatory lungs via chemotaxis&#8208;guided, self&#8208;propelled movement, for effective treatment of acute pneumonia via immunoregulation induced by curcumin and the aggregates.

         <title>Encoded Structural Color Microneedle Patches for Multiple Screening of Wound Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detection. Here, we describe novel encoded structural color microneedle patches (EMNs) combining photonic crystals (PhCs) and microneedle arrays (MNs) for multiple wound biomarker detection in situ. Using a partitioned and layered casting strategy, the EMNs can be divided into different modules and each serves for the detection of small molecules associated with chronic hard&#8208;to&#8208;healing wounds, including pH, glucose and histamine. pH sensing is based on the interaction between hydrogen ions and carboxyl groups from hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM); glucose sensing is achieved with the help of glucose&#8208;responsive fluorophenylboronic acid (FPBA); while histamine sensing relies on specific recognition of aptamers and target molecules. Owing to the responsive volume change of these three modules in the presence of target molecules, the EMNs can create structural color change and characteristic peak shift of the PhCs, thus realizing the qualitative measurement of target molecules with a spectrum analyzer. It is further demonstrated that the EMNs behave well in the multivariate detection of rat wound molecules. These features indicate that the EMNs can be valuable smart detection systems for wound status screening.

         <title>Density of States Engineering of n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers for High Charge Transport Performances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Charge transport of conjugated polymers in functional devices closely relates to their density of states (DOS) distributions. However, systemic DOS engineering for conjugated polymers is challenging due to the need for modulated methods and the unclear relationship between DOS and electrical properties. Here, we engineered the DOS distribution of conjugated polymers to enhance their electrical performances. The DOS distribution of polymer films was tailored using three processing solvents with different Hansen solubility parameters. The highest n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (39 &#177; 3 S cm&#8722;1), the highest power factor (63 &#177; 11 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), and the highest Hall mobility (0.14 &#177; 0.02 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1) of the polymer (FBDPPV&#8208;OEG) were obtained in three films with three various DOS distributions, respectively. Through theoretical and experimental exploration, we reveal that the carrier concentration and transport property of conjugated polymers could be efficiently controlled by DOS engineering, paving the way for rationally fabricating organic semiconductors.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge transport of conjugated polymers in functional devices closely relates to their density of states (DOS) distributions. However, systemic DOS engineering for conjugated polymers is challenging due to the need for modulated methods and the unclear relationship between DOS and electrical properties. Here, we engineered the DOS distribution of conjugated polymers to enhance their electrical performances. The DOS distribution of polymer films was tailored using three processing solvents with different Hansen solubility parameters. The highest n-type electrical conductivity (39 &#177; 3 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), the highest power factor (63 &#177; 11 &#956;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and the highest Hall mobility (0.14 &#177; 0.02 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;) of the polymer (FBDPPV-OEG) were obtained in three films with three various DOS distributions, respectively. Through theoretical and experimental exploration, we reveal that the carrier concentration and transport property of conjugated polymers could be efficiently controlled by DOS engineering, paving the way for rationally fabricating organic semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Upper Critical Field in Ta&#8208;Doped Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are promising platforms for next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics. The layered Weyl semimetal (W,Mo)Te2 series features structural phase transition, nonsaturated magnetoresistance, superconductivity, and exotic topological physics. However, the superconducting critical temperature of the bulk (W,Mo)Te2 remains ultralow without applying a high pressure. Here, we observe the significantly enhanced superconductivity with a transition temperature as large as about 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8208;xTaxTe2 single crystals upon Ta doping (0 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.22), which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level. In addition, an enhanced perpendicular upper critical field of 14.5 T exceeding the Pauli limit is also observed in Td&#8208;phase Mo1&#8208;xTaxTe2 (x = 0.08), indicating the possible emergence of unconventional mixed singlet&#8208;triplet superconductivity owing to the inversion symmetry breaking. Our work provides a new pathway for exploring the exotic superconductivity and topological physics in transition metal dichalcogenides.

         <title>Multiscale Architectured Membranes, Electrodes, and Transport Layers for Next&#8208;Generation Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent progress in the key components of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on a novel architecturing strategy is highlighted. Diverse multiscale architecture technologies for modifying and reconstructing the membrane, electrode, and transport layers for realizing high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs, focusing on their structures and functions, are comprehensively presented.








Abstract
Over the past few decades, considerable advances have been achieved in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) based on the development of material technology. Recently, an emerging multiscale architecturing technology covering nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales has been regarded as an alternative strategy to overcome the hindrance to achieving high&#8208;performance and reliable PEMFCs. This review summarizes the recent progress in the key components of PEMFCs based on a novel architecture strategy. In the first section, diverse architectural methods for patterning the membrane surface with random, single&#8208;scale, and multiscale structures as well as their efficacy for improving catalyst utilization, charge transport, and water management are discussed. In the subsequent section, the electrode structures designed with 1D and 3D multiscale structures to enable low Pt usage, improve oxygen transport, and achieve high electrode durability are elucidated. Finally, recent advances in the architectured transport layer for improving mass transportation including pore gradient, perforation, and patterned wettability for gas diffusion layer and 3D structured/engineered flow fields are described.

         <title>Revival of Ferroelectric Memories Based on Emerging Fluorite&#8208;Structured Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorite&#8208;structured ferroelectrics are breakthrough materials for the development of ferroelectric memories for nanoscale electronic devices owing to their scalability and complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) compatibility as well as the availability of established deposition techniques. This review covers the history of ferroelectric memory based on conventional ferroelectric to recent research on fluorite&#8208;structured ferroelectrics and remaining issues to achieve large&#8208;scale integration for practical industrial applications.








Abstract
Over the last few decades, the research on ferroelectric memories has been limited due to their dimensional scalability and incompatibility with complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The discovery of ferroelectricity in fluorite&#8208;structured oxides revived interest in the research on ferroelectric memories, by inducing nanoscale nonvolatility in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art gate insulators by minute doping and thermal treatment. The potential of this approach has been demonstrated by the fabrication of sub&#8208;30&#160;nm electronic devices. Nonetheless, to realize practical applications, various technical limitations, such as insufficient reliability including endurance, retention, and imprint, as well as large device&#8208;to&#8208;device&#8208;variation, require urgent solutions. Furthermore, such limitations should be considered based on targeting devices as well as applications. Various types of ferroelectric memories including ferroelectric random&#8208;access&#8208;memory, ferroelectric field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistor, and ferroelectric tunnel junction should be considered for classical nonvolatile memories as well as emerging neuromorphic computing and processing&#8208;in&#8208;memory. Therefore, from the viewpoint of materials science, this review covers the recent research focusing on ferroelectric memories from the history of conventional approaches to future prospects.

         <title>Enzymatically Crosslinked Collagen as a Versatile Matrix for In Vitro and In Vivo Co&#8208;Engineering of Blood and Lymphatic Vasculature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel collagen biopolymer bearing enzyme&#8208;recognizable crosslinkers is developed to rapidly produce bulk hydrogels exhibiting strong (lymph&#8208;)angiogenic properties. Orthogonal crosslinking enables further modification of the collagen backbone. Using a second enzyme, the tethering of pro&#8208;angiogenic QK&#8208;peptides, the production of multimaterial scaffolds that enable spatially restricted vascularization as well as the biofabrication of annealed &#181;&#8208;gels is demonstrated.








Abstract
Adequate vascularization is required for the successful translation of many in vitro engineered tissues. This study presents a novel collagen derivative that harbors multiple recognition peptides for orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking based on sortase A&#160;(SrtA) and Factor XIII&#160;(FXIII). SrtA&#8208;mediated crosslinking enables the rapid co&#8208;engineering of human blood and lymphatic microcapillaries and mesoscale capillaries in bulk hydrogels. Whereas tuning of gel stiffness determines the extent of neovascularization, the relative number of blood and lymphatic capillaries recapitulates the ratio of blood and lymphatic endothelial cells originally seeded into the hydrogel. Bioengineered capillaries readily form luminal structures and exhibit typical maturation markers both in vitro and in vivo. The secondary crosslinking enzyme Factor XIII is used for in situ tethering of the VEGF mimetic QK peptide to collagen. This approach supports the formation of blood and lymphatic capillaries in the absence of exogenous VEGF. Orthogonal enzymatic crosslinking is further used to bioengineer hydrogels with spatially defined polymer compositions with pro&#8208; and anti&#8208;angiogenic properties. Finally, macroporous scaffolds based on secondary crosslinking of microgels enable vascularization independent from supporting fibroblasts. Overall, this work demonstrates for the first time the co&#8208;engineering of mature micro&#8208; and meso&#8208;sized blood and lymphatic capillaries using a highly versatile collagen derivative.

         <title>Priority and Prospect of Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review expounds on why implementing a membrane&#8208;based electrolyte is the priority for mass production of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries and identifies critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide electrolyte membrane. The challenges and associated strategies for achieving these criteria in terms of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration are systematically analyzed and summarized.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) employing sulfide solid electrolytes (SEs) promise sustainable energy storage systems with energy&#8208;dense integration and critical intrinsic safety, yet they still require cost&#8208;effective manufacturing and the integration of thin membrane&#8208;based SE separators into large&#8208;format cells to achieve scalable deployment. This review, based on an overview of sulfide SE materials, is expounded on why implementing a thin membrane&#8208;based separator is the priority for mass production of ASSLBs and critical criteria for capturing a high&#8208;quality thin sulfide SE membrane are identified. Moreover, from the aspects of material availability, membrane processing, and cell integration, the major challenges and associated strategies are described to meet these criteria throughout the whole manufacturing chain to provide a realistic assessment of the current status of sulfide SE membranes. Finally, future directions and prospects for scalable and manufacturable sulfide SE membranes for ASSLBs are presented.

         <title>Fracture Detection in Bio&#8208;Glues with Fluorescent&#8208;Protein&#8208;Based Optical Force Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ratiometric protein optical force probes is designed and used to fabricate force&#8208;sensitive bio&#8208;glue. The visualization of stress concentrations, monitoring of fracture zones, and identification of adhesive or cohesive failure are achieved by fluorescence spectroscopy and lifetime imaging microscopy.








Abstract
Glues are being used to bond, seal, and repair in industry and biomedicine. The improvement of gluing performance is hence important for the development of new glues with better and balanced property spaces, which in turn necessitates a mechanistic understanding of their mechanical failure. Optical force probes (OFPs) allow the observation of mechanical material damage in polymers from the macro&#8208; down to the microscale, yet have never been employed in glues. Here, the development of a series of ratiometric OFPs based on fluorescent&#8208;protein&#8211;dye and protein&#8211;protein conjugates and their incorporation into genetically engineered bio&#8208;glues is reported. The OFPs are designed to efficiently modulate F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer&#160;upon force application thereby reporting on force&#8208;induced molecular alterations independent of concentration and fluorescence intensity both spectrally and through their fluorescence lifetime. By fluorescence spectroscopy in solution and in the solid state and by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy, stress concentrations are visualized and adhesive and cohesive failure in the fracture zone is differentiated.

         <title>Photoinduced Dithiolane Crosslinking for Multiresponsive Dynamic Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Disulfide&#8208;crosslinked adaptable hydrogels capable of multiple responses to stimuli are prepared using initiator&#8208;free photocrosslinking of 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes, which are inherently photoresponsive cyclic disulfides. Using a variety of stimuli, multiple dynamic transformations are demonstrated in these hydrogels; a series of complex cell culture experiments highlight the versatility of this system for studying effects of mechanical manipulation of the cellular microenvironment.








Abstract
While many hydrogels are elastic networks crosslinked by covalent bonds, viscoelastic hydrogels with adaptable crosslinks are increasingly being developed to better recapitulate time and position&#8208;dependent processes found in many tissues. In this work, 1,2&#8208;dithiolanes are presented as dynamic covalent photocrosslinkers of hydrogels, resulting in disulfide bonds throughout the hydrogel that respond to multiple stimuli. Using lipoic acid as a model dithiolane, disulfide crosslinks are formed under physiological conditions, enabling cell encapsulation via an initiator&#8208;free light&#8208;induced dithiolane ring&#8208;opening photopolymerization. The resulting hydrogels allow for multiple photoinduced dynamic responses including stress relaxation, stiffening, softening, and network functionalization using a single chemistry, which can be supplemented by permanent reaction with alkenes to further control network properties and connectivity using irreversible thioether crosslinks. Moreover, complementary photochemical approaches are used to achieve rapid and complete sample degradation via radical scission and post&#8208;gelation network stiffening when irradiated in the presence of reactive gel precursor. The results herein demonstrate the versatility of this material chemistry to study and direct 2D and 3D cell&#8208;material interactions. This work highlights dithiolane&#8208;based hydrogel photocrosslinking as a robust method for generating adaptable hydrogels with a range of biologically relevant mechanical and chemical properties that are varied on demand.

Abstract
As a widely used commodity chemical, ammonia is critical for producing nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers and serving as the promising zero&#8208;carbon energy carrier. Photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (PEC NRR) can provide a solar&#8208;powered green and sustainable route for synthesis of ammonia (NH3). Herein, we report an optimum PEC system with a Si&#8208;based hierarchically&#8208;structured PdCu/TiO2/Si photocathode and well&#8208;thought&#8208;out trifluoroethanol as the proton source for lithium&#8208;mediated PEC NRR, achieving a record high NH3 yield of 43.09&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 46.15% under 0.12&#8208;MPa O2 and 3.88&#8208;MPa N2 at 0.07&#160;V versus lithium(0/+) redox couple (versus Li0/+). PEC measurements coupled with operando characterization revealed that the PdCu/TiO2/Si photocathode under N2 pressures facilitate the reduction of N2 to form lithium nitride (Li3N), which reacts with active protons to produce NH3 while releasing the Li+ to reinitiate the cycle of the PEC NRR. The Li&#8208;mediated PEC NRR process is further enhanced by introducing small amount of O2 or CO2 under pressure by accelerating the decomposition of Li3N. For the first time, this work provides mechanistic understanding of the lithium&#8208;mediated PEC NRR process and opens new avenues for efficient solar&#8208;powered green conversion of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>Modular Synthesis of Semiconducting Graft Co&#8208;polymers to Achieve &#8220;clickable&#8221; Fluorescent Nanoparticles with Long Circulation and Specific Cancer Targeting</title>

Abstract
Semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) have been explored for applications in cancer theranostics because of their high absorption coefficients, photostability and biocompatibility. However, SPNs are susceptible to aggregation and protein fouling in physiological conditions, which can be detrimental for in vivo applications. Here, we describe a method for achieving colloidally stable and low&#8208;fouling SPNs by grafting PEG onto the backbone of the fluorescent semiconducting polymer, poly(9,9&#8242;&#8208;dioctylfluorene&#8208;5&#8208;fluoro&#8208;2,1,3&#8208;benzothiadiazole) (F8BT&#8208;F), in a simple one&#8208;step substitution reaction, post&#8208;polymerisation. Further, by utilising azide&#8208;functionalised PEG we site&#8208;specifically &#8220;click&#8221; anti&#8208;HER2 antibodies, Fab fragments, or affibodies onto the SPN surface, which allows the functionalised SPNs to specifically target HER2&#8208;positive cancer cells. In vivo, our PEGylated SPNs were found to have excellent circulation efficiencies in zebrafish embryos for up to seven days post&#8208;injection. SPNs functionalised with affibodies were then shown to be able to target HER2 expressing cancer cells in a zebrafish xenograft model. The covalent PEGylated SPN system described herein shows great potential for cancer theranostics.

         <title>Realizing the heteromorphic superlattice: Repeated heterolayers of amorphous insulator and polycrystalline semiconductor with minimal interface defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An unconventional &#8220;heteromorphic&#8221; superlattice (HSL) is realized, comprised of repeated layers of different materials with differing morphologies: semiconducting pc&#8208;In2O3 layers interleaved with insulating a&#8208;MoO3 layers. Originally proposed by Tsu in 1989, yet never fully realized, the high quality of the HSL heterostructure demonstrated here validates the intuition of Tsu, whereby the flexibility of the bond angle in the amorphous phase and the passivation effect of the oxide at interfacial bonds serve to create smooth, high&#8208;mobility interfaces. The alternating amorphous layers prevent strain accumulation in the polycrystalline layers while suppressing defect propagation across the HSL. For the HSL with 7:7&#160;nm layer thickness, the observed electron mobility of 71 cm2/Vs, matches that of the highest quality In2O3 thin films. The atomic structure and electronic properties of crystalline In2O3 / amorphous MoO3 interfaces are verified using ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid functional calculations. This work generalizes the superlattice concept to an entirely new paradigm of morphological combinations.

         <title>Ceria Nanoparticles as Copper Chaperones that Activate SOD1 for Synergistic Antioxidant Therapy to Treat Ischemic Vascular Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ceria nanoparticles deposited with copper ions, cofactors for the indigenous antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), are synthesized for effective and synergistic antioxidant therapy to treat ischemic vascular diseases in which the imbalance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) aggravates the tissue damage. Ceria nanoparticles chaperone copper ions to elevate the expression of SOD1 to significantly reduce the ROS&#8208;induced damage.








Abstract
All exogenous nanomaterials undergo rapid biotransformation once injected into the body and fall short of executing the intended purpose. Here,&#160;it is reported that copper&#8208;deposited ceria nanoparticles (CuCe NPs) exhibit enhanced antioxidant effects over&#160;pristine ceria nanoparticles, as the released copper buffers the depletion of glutathione while providing the bioavailable copper as a cofactor for the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase 1. The upregulated intracellular antioxidants along with the ceria nanoparticles synergistically scavenge reactive oxygen species and promote anti&#8208;inflammation and M2 polarization of macrophages by modulating signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 6 (STAT1 and STAT6). The therapeutic effect of CuCe NPs is demonstrated in ischemic vascular diseases (i.e., murine models of hindlimb ischemia and myocardial infarction) in which the copper&#8208;deposition affords increased perfusion and alleviation in tissue damage. The results provide rationale that metal oxide nanomaterials can be designed in a way to induce the upregulation of specific biological factors for optimal therapeutic performance.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Conversion of Silicon Nitride Nanopore&#160;to Nanonet for Single&#8208;Protein Trapping Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solid&#8208;state nanonet sensing platform made via&#160;light irradiation of a silicon nitride nanopore&#160;enables single&#8208;protein analysis. As a model protein, bovine serum albumin produces collision and trapping flipping signals on the nanonet, providing more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. Additionally, the nanonet allows for capture of the real&#8208;time UV&#8208;induced structure changes of the protein.








Abstract
The single&#8208;molecule technique for investigation of an unlabeled protein in solution is very attractive but with great challenges. Nanopore sensing as a label&#8208;free tool can be used for collecting the structural information of individual proteins, but currently offers only limited capabilities due to the fast translocation of the target. Here, a reliable and facile method is developed to convert the silicon nitride nanopore to a stable nanonet platform for single&#8208;entity sensing by electrophoretic or electroosmotic trapping. A nanonet is fabricated based on a material reorganization process caused by electron&#8208;beam and light&#8208;irradiation treatment. Using protein molecules as a model, it is revealed that the solid&#8208;state nanonet can produce collision and trapping flipping signals of the protein, which provides more structural information than traditional nanopore sensing. More importantly, thanks to the excellent stability of the solid&#8208;state silicon nitride nanonet, it is demonstrated that the ultraviolet&#8208;light&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced structural&#8208;change process of an individual protein can be captured. The developed nanonet supplies a robust platform for single&#8208;entity studies but is not limited to proteins.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials&#8217; Biological Effect Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>

         <dc:description>
A Pt and Au nanoparticle decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise choroidal neovascularization occlusion and microenvironment regulation. A novel &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; intraocular nanomedicine delivery mode is exploited to penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis. The mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF reduce by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively, compared to verteporfin treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. In this work, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface&#8208;grafted cyclo(Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp&#8211;d&#8208;Phe&#8211;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

         <title>Y&#8208;Type Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors with Outer Branched Side Chains and Inner Cyclohexane Side Chains for 19.36% Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors with outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains are designed for polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiencies of 18.52% and 19.36% achieved in the binary and ternary blend devices, respectively, which are among the highest values for single&#8208;junction solar cells at present.








Abstract
Raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors can increase the open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) and thus the photovoltaic performance of the current top performing polymer solar cells (PSCs). One of the viable routes is demonstrated by the successful Y6 derivative of L8&#8208;BO with the branched alkyl chains at the outer side. This will introduce steric hindrance and reduce intermolecular aggregation, thus open up the bandgap and raise the LUMO energy level. To take further advantages of the steric hindrance influence on optoelectronic properties of Y6 derivatives, two Y&#8208;type non&#8208;fullerene acceptors of BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F and BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4Cl are designed and synthesized by adopting outer branched side chains and inner cyclohexane side chains. An outstanding Voc of 0.937&#160;V is achieved in the D18:BTP&#8208;Cy&#8208;4F binary blend devices along with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.52%. With the addition of BTP&#8208;eC9 to extend the absorption spectral coverage, a remarkable PCE of 19.36% is realized finally in the related ternary blend devices, which is one of the highest values for single&#8208;junction PSCs at present. The results illustrate the great potential of cyclohexane side chains in constructing high&#8208;performance non&#8208;fullerene acceptors and their PSCs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Transparent, Chiral Organic Photodiodes with Incident Direction&#8208;Dependent Selectivity for Circularly Polarized Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semi&#8208;transparent organic photodiodes containing chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor and achiral polymer donor respond differently to left and right circularly polarized light. The preference switches when changing the direction of the incoming light. Circular selective absorption in combination with selective collection of carriers from a narrow space charge region can account for the change in polarization.








Abstract
Detection of the circular polarization of light is possible using chiral semiconductors, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Semi&#8208;transparent chiral photodiodes allow for a simple experiment to investigate the basis of their selectivity: changing the side from which the diode is illuminated. A reversal of circular selectivity is observed in photocurrent generation when changing the direction of illumination on organic, bulk&#8208;heterojunction cells. The change in selectivity can be explained by a space&#8208;charge limitation on the collection of photocarriers in combination with preferential absorption of one of the circular polarizations of near&#8208;infrared light by the chiral non&#8208;fullerene acceptor. The space&#8208;charge limitation is supported by detailed measurements of frequency and intensity dependence of dc and ac photocurrents.

         <title>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Mediated Drug Delivery for First Aid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system is developed for targeted drug delivery (uFAST), which enables autonomous administration of emergency therapeutics via UAVs to achieve timely first aid. The implementability and safety of the uFAST with a dual&#8208;mode glucagon microneedle patch in emergency care is well demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig disease model.








Abstract
Timely administration of key medications toward patients with sudden diseases is critical to saving lives. However, slow transport of first&#8208;aid therapeutics and the potential absence of trained people for drug usage can&#160;lead&#160;to severe injuries or even death. Herein, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid system for targeted delivery (uFAST) is developed. It allows unattended administration of emergency therapeutics&#8208;loaded transdermal microneedle (MN) patches toward patients to relieve symptoms by a contact&#8208;triggered microneedle applicator (CTMA). The implementability and safety of the uFAST for first aid is demonstrated in a severe hypoglycemic pig model by automatically delivering a glucagon patch with immediate and bioresponsive dual release modes. This platform technique may facilitate the development of UAV&#8208;mediated first&#8208;aid treatments for other sudden diseases.

         <title>Dislocated Bilayer MOF Enables High&#8208;Selectivity Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D monolayer and 2D bilayer metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are constructed by a simple solvothermal method. The bilayer MOF is a novel dislocation 2D porphyrin&#8208;based MOF material that exhibits good structural stability as well as ultra&#8208;high CO selectivity for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (100% selectivity). This work offers a new strategy for the construction of bilayer MOFs and provides a new perspective for the customization of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
The highly selective photoreduction of CO2 into valuable small&#8208;molecule chemical feedstocks such as CO is an effective strategy for addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. However, it remains a challenge because the complex CO2 photoreduction process usually generates multiple possible products and requires a subsequent separation step. In this paper, 2D monolayer and bilayer porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are successfully constructed by adjusting the reaction temperature and solvent polarity with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetrakis(4&#8208;pyridyl)porphyrin as the light&#8208;harvesting ligand. The bilayer MOF is a low&#8208;dimensional MOF with a special structure in which the upper and lower layers are arranged in dislocation and are bridged by halogen ions. This bilayer MOF exhibits 100% ultra&#8208;high selectivity for the reduction of CO2 to CO under simulated sunlight without any cocatalyst or photosensitizer and can be recycled at least three times. The intrinsic mechanism of this photocatalytic CO2 reduction process is explored through experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work shows that the rational design of the number of layers in 2D MOF structures can tune the stability of these structures and opens a new avenue for the design of highly selective MOF photocatalysts.

         <title>Multifunctional 3D&#8208;Printed Pollen Grain&#8208;Inspired Hydrogel Microrobots for On&#8208;Demand Anchoring and Cargo Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional hydrogel microrobot is created by different stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels with pollen grain&#8208;inspired microstructures. The robot is capable of conducting temperature&#8208;responsive on&#8208;demand surface attachment, magnetic locomotion, and pH&#8208;responsive cargo delivery toward biomedical applications.








Abstract
While a majority of wireless microrobots have shown multi&#8208;responsiveness to implement complex biomedical functions, their functional executions are strongly dependent on the range of stimulus inputs, which curtails their functional diversity. Furthermore, their responsive functions are coupled to each other, which results in the overlap of the task operations. Here, a 3D&#8208;printed multifunctional microrobot inspired by pollen grains with three hydrogel components is demonstrated: iron platinum (FePt) nanoparticle&#8208;embedded pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA), poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM), and poly N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide acrylic acid (pNIPAM&#8208;AAc) structures. Each of these structures exhibits their respective targeted functions: responding to magnetic fields for torque&#8208;driven surface rolling and steering, exhibiting temperature responsiveness for on&#8208;demand surface attachment (anchoring), and pH&#8208;responsive cargo release. The versatile multifunctional pollen grain&#8208;inspired robots conceptualized here pave the way for various future medical microrobots to improve their projected performance and functional diversity.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer as a New Platform for Efficient and Selective Electroreduction of Nitrate into Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general strategy for simultaneous enhancement of activity and selectivity toward nitrate electroreduction into ammonia (NRA) is demonstrated by utilizing Ni&#8208;based conjugated coordination polymer catalysts for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. Coordination modulation can tailor their electrostatic attractions with the metal&#8208;hydrated cations that can regulate proton migration at the catalyst surface, promoting the NRA and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).








Abstract
Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni&#8208;single&#8208;atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO4&#8208;CCP and NiN4&#8208;CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study. The NiO4&#8208;CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming the NiN4&#8208;CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal&#8208;hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.

&lt;p&gt;Electroreduction of nitrate into ammonia (NRA) provides a sustainable route to convert the widespread nitrate pollutants into high-value-added products under ambient conditions, which unfortunately suffers from unsatisfactory selectivity due to the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Previous strategies of modifying the metal sites of catalysts often met a dilemma for simultaneously promoting activity and selectivity toward NRA. Here, a general strategy is reported to enable an efficient and selective NRA process through coordination modulation of single-atom catalysts to tailor the local proton concentration at the catalyst surface. By contrast, two analogous Ni-single-atom enriched conjugated coordination polymers (NiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CCP and NiN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CCP) with different coordination motifs are investigated for the proof-of-concept study. The NiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CCP catalyst exhibits an ammonia yield rate as high as 1.83&#160;mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a Faradaic efficiency of 94.7% under a current density of 125&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outperforming the NiN&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-CCP catalyst. These experimental and theoretical studies both suggest that the strategy of coordination modulation can not only accelerate the NRA&#160;by adjusting the adsorption energies of NRA intermediates on the metal sites but also inhibit the HER through regulating the proton migration with contributions from the metal-hydrated cations adsorbed at the catalyst surface, thus achieving simultaneous enhancement of NRA selectivity and activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking High Capacity and Fast Na+ Diffusion of HxCrS2 by Proton&#8208;Exchange Pretreatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pretreatment of NaCrS2 to produce HxCrS2 results in a more robust and higher performing electrode by numerous measures. Proton exchange produces a heterostructure that permits fast diffusion while also seemingly unlocking reversible access to cationic redox, enabling high capacity. The unique biphasic structure of HxCrS2 may be generalizable to other materials, opening a new class of electrode materials.








Abstract
This study presents a new material, &#8220;HxCrS2&#8221; (denotes approximate composition) formed by proton&#8208;exchange of NaCrS2 which has a measured capacity of 728 mAh g&#8722;1 with significant improvements to capacity retention, sustaining over 700 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling experiments. This is the highest reported capacity for a transition metal sulfide electrode and outperforms the most promising proposed sodium anodes to date. HxCrS2 exhibits a biphasic structure featuring alternating crystalline and amorphous lamella on the scale of a few nanometers. This unique structural motif enables reversible access to Cr redox in the material resulting in higher capacities than seen in the parent structure which features only S redox. Pretreatment by proton&#8208;exchange offers a route to materials such as HxCrS2 which provide fast diffusion and high capacities for sodium&#8208;ion&#160;batteries.

         <title>Ultrasensitive and Ultraprecise Pressure Sensors for Soft Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Making flexible sensors more precise is the focus of this research. It is found that by making the pressure sensing layer using pure materials&#160;and separating it from the rest of the sensor structure, the errors caused by the sensor's deformation can be reduced when it is subjected to external forces. This leads to improved precision and flexibility in sensing.








Abstract
Highly sensitive soft pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention in recent years due to their great promise in robotics, healthcare, smart wearables, etc. Although high sensitivities can be realized by existing sensing mechanisms, they usually cause large random errors owing to inhomogeneous sensing layers, thus considerably reducing the sensing precision for practical applications. Herein, a pure&#8208;polymer and field emission bilayer structure (PFEBS)&#8208;based transduction mechanism is presented to successfully design an ultrasensitive and ultraprecise soft pressure sensor for the first time. This unique structure enables numerous tunneling electrons generated by field emission to be transmitted through the homogeneous sensing layer, which undergoes uniform deformation under subtle pressures, simultaneously achieving a sensing precision with variation &lt;1.62% and a sensitivity of 372.2 kPa&#8722;1. This study offers a new design strategy to develop next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance flexible pressure sensors for soft systems.

         <title>Highly Damping and Self&#8208;Healable Ionic Elastomer from Dynamic Phase Separation of Sticky Fluorinated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the heterogeneous structure of adipose tissue, the first example of damping self&#8208;healable ionic elastomer is reported, which features a dynamic phase&#8208;separated structure with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix. By virtue of phase separation and sticky liquid crystal assembly of fluorinated copolymers, this design reconciles elasticity and damping capacity, which are usually contradictive in previous ionic skins.








Abstract
Shock&#8208;induced low&#8208;frequency vibration damage is extremely harmful to bionic soft robots and machines that may incur the malfunction of fragile electronic elements. However, current skin&#8208;like self&#8208;healable ionic elastomers as the artificial sensing and protecting layer still lack the ability to dampen vibrations, due to their almost opposite design for molecular frictions to material's elasticity. Inspired by the two&#8208;phase structure of adipose tissue (the natural damping skin layer), here, a highly damping ionic elastomer with energy&#8208;dissipating nanophases embedded in an elastic matrix is introduced, which is formed by polymerization&#8208;induced dynamic phase separation of sticky fluorinated copolymers in the presence of lithium salts. Such a supramolecular design decouples the elastic and damping functions into two distinct phases, and thus reconciles a few intriguing properties including ionic conductivity, high stretchability, softness, strain&#8208;stiffening, elastic recovery, room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healability, recyclability, and most importantly, record&#8208;high damping capacity at the human motion frequency range (loss factor tan &#948;&#160;&gt;&#160;1 at 0.1&#8211;50&#160;Hz). This study opens the door for the artificial syntheses of high&#8208;performance damping ionic skins with robust sensing and protective applications in soft electronics and robotics.

         <title>Picoperovskites: The Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 form &#8220;picoperovskites&#8221; in 1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm&#8208;diameter single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes with cross&#8208;sectional unit&#8208;cell or sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell dimensions. The smallest of these are bilayer inorganic polymers retaining ABX3 stoichiometry while intermediate&#8208;scale Cs3PbBr3 preserves Pb2+ by forming ordered vacancies. The largest Cs4Sn4Ix form alternates Cs4 and Sn4Ix layers along the nanotube cavities.








Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionizing the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. Four isolated sub&#8208;nanometer, or picoscale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8776;1.2&#8211;1.6&#160;nm single&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3 are reported. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8776;1.4&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires, one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8776;1.2&#160;nm&#8208;diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic&#8208;polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures, one&#8208;fourth of an ABX3 unit cell in cross section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating bandgap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8211;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is first proposed. The synthesized platinum&#8211;bismuth sulfide&#160;nanoparticles exhibit ultrasound&#8208;catalyzed hydrogen production, glutathione oxidation, relieve hypoxia in vitro and in vivo, and effectively kill cancer cells by inhibiting cancer cell energy metabolism, increasing intratumoral reactive oxygen species levels, and inducing DNA damage.








Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment, although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution is proposed, which is defined as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, the narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is selected as the sonocatalyst and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, the Pt nanoparticles help to capture sonoexcited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH), as a natural hole sacrificial agent, can consume sonoexcited holes, which greatly improves the charge&#8208;separation efficiency and promotes controllable and sustainable H2&#160;generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3&#160;nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2&#160;and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, the Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2&#160;to relieve tumor hypoxia,&#160;thus&#160;being synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis&#8208;mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Dual/Triple Template&#8208;Induced Evolved Emulsion for Controllable Construction of Anisotropic Carbon Nanoparticles from Concave to Convex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual/triple template&#8208;induced evolved emulsion strategy is developed for the precise construction of anisotropic mesoporous carbon nanoparticles. It not only endows the concave structure with adjustable size and meso&#8208;structure but also realizes the innovative transformation from concave to convex in a one&#8208;pot method. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed basin&#8208;concave and mountain&#8208;convex nanoparticles manifest excellent performance for improving drug release rate and enzyme catalytic efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic mesoporous carbon (AMC) nanoparticles with asymmetric external morphologies, topological internal structure, and superior performance of carbon species are attracting great attention because of their seductive features differentiating them from symmetric nanoparticles. However, a bewildering challenge but crucial desire remains to endow them with flexibly tunable morphology and pore structure. Herein, a dual/triple&#8208;templating evolved emulsion strategy for tunable fabrication of AMC nanoparticles with distinctive defined structure by interface&#8208;energy&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly is first reported based on a brand&#8208;new mechanism. It describes the possible formation process of the concave&#8208;cavity structure and allows for manipulation of the longitudinal and lateral sizes systematically by adjusting emulsion polarity and sodium oleate dosage, respectively. Interestingly, the internal pore structure can be rearranged into radial channels and the external morphology can realize structural transformation from concave to convex by innovatively introducing the third template n&#8208;hexanol, which is unprecedented at nanoscale. Remarkably, due to the excellent properties of carbon species and unique structural characteristics, AMC nanoparticles not only demonstrate good biocompatibility but also exhibit splendid performance in improving the dissolution and release rates of insoluble drug and enhancing the enzyme catalytic efficiency. Generally, this approach provides new inspiration and insights for expanding exquisite anisotropic nanomaterials for many potential applications.

         <title>A Breathable, Passive&#8208;Cooling, Non&#8208;Inflammatory, and Biodegradable Aerogel Electronic Skin for Wearable Physical&#8208;Electrophysiological&#8208;Chemical Analysis</title>

A breathable, passive&#8208;cooling, non&#8208;inflammatory, biodegradable, and flexible aerogel electronic skin is developed to monitor physical, electrophysiological, and metabolic biomarkers from the human body continuously and simultaneously.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring of human health can be significantly improved by designing novel electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) platforms that mimic the characteristics and sensitivity of human skin. A high&#8208;quality E&#8208;skin platform that can simultaneously monitor multiple physiological and metabolic biomarkers without introducing skin discomfort or irritation is an unmet medical need. Conventional E&#8208;skins are either monofunctional or made from elastomeric films that do not include key synergistic features of natural skin, such as multi&#8208;sensing, breathability, and thermal management capabilities in a single patch. Herein, a biocompatible and biodegradable E&#8208;skin patch based on flexible gelatin methacryloyl aerogel (FGA) for non&#8208;invasive and continuous monitoring of multiple biomarkers of interest is engineered and demonstrated. Taking advantage of cryogenic temperature treatment and slow polymerization, FGA is fabricated with a highly interconnected porous structure that displays good flexibility, passive&#8208;cooling capabilities, and ultra&#8208;lightweight properties that make it comfortable to wear for long periods of time. It also provides numerous permeable capillary channels for thermal&#8208;moisture transfer, ensuring its excellent breathability. Therefore, the engineered FGA&#8208;based E&#8208;skin can simultaneously monitor body temperature, hydration, and biopotentials via electrophysiological sensors and detect glucose, lactate, and alcohol levels via electrochemical sensors. This work offers a previously unexplored materials strategy for next&#8208;generation E&#8208;skin platforms with superior practicality.

         <title>A Pseudocapacitor Diode Based on Ion&#8208;Selective Surface Redox Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudocapacitor diode is proposed for the first time, which is constructed by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox mechanism of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous electrolyte KOH, thus successfully integrating the function of blocking the unidirectional current response of a diode into an aqueous pseudocapacitor with fast ion conduction capability.








Abstract
Supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is a novel device that integrates ion diode functionality into a conventional electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor and is expected to have great applications in emerging fields such as signal propagation, microcircuit rectification, logic operations, and neuromorphology. Here, a brand new pseudocapacitor diode is reported that has both high charge storage (50.2&#160;C&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) and high rectification (the rectification ratio of 0.79 at 200&#160;mV&#160;s&#8722;1) properties, which is realized by the ion&#8208;selective surface redox reaction of spinel ZnCo2O4 in aqueous alkaline electrolyte. Furthermore, an application of the integrated device is demonstrated in the logic gate of circuit system to realize the logic operations of &#8220;AND&#8221; and &#8220;OR&#8221;. This work not only expands the types of CAPodes, but also provides a train of thought for constructing high&#8208;performance capacitive ionic diodes.

A dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is presented for real&#8208;time near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. It provides a non&#8208;invasive tool to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis during cancer therapy and predict cancer therapeutic efficacy, hence capable of being applied to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.








Abstract
Real&#8208;time imaging of programmed cancer cell death (PCD) is imperative to monitor cancer therapeutic efficacy and tailor therapeutic regimens; however, specific in vivo detection of intratumoral pyroptosis remains challenging. Herein, a dual&#8208;locked and tandem activatable probe (DTAP) is reported for near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging of intratumoral pyroptosis during cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapy in living mice. The probe comprises a hemicyanine dye dual&#8208;locked with an enzyme&#8208;responsive moiety that can be tandemly cleaved by pyroptosis&#8208;related biomarker (Caspase&#8208;1) and cancer biomarker (GGT) to turn on its NIRF signal. As pyroptosis plays a vital role in triggering anti&#8208;tumor immune responses, the activated signal of DTAP correlates well with the population of tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes and tumor growth inhibition, consequently permitting the prediction of cancer therapeutic efficacy. This study also provides a non&#8208;invasive technique to study the regulatory mechanism of pyroptosis in cancer therapy and to optimize cancer chemo&#8208;immunotherapies for precision medicine.

         <title>Graph Analysis with Multifunctional Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristive Crossbar Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graph analysis based on the desired sneak current is performed using a self&#8208;rectifying memristor and a &#8220;metal cell at diagonalcrossbar array (mCBA)&#8221; structure. mCBA effectively extracts hidden information from complex networks without preprocessing and loss of information. Three graph algorithms (pathfinding, link prediction, community detection) and brain network&#8208;based attention&#8208;deficit/hyperactivity disorder classification are performed effectively based on the mCBA.








Abstract
Many big data have interconnected and dynamic graph structures growing over time. Analyzing these graphical data requires the hidden relationship between the nodes in the graphs to be identified, which has conventionally been achieved by finding the effective similarity. However, graphs are generally non&#8208;Euclidean, which does not allow finding it. In this study, the non&#8208;Euclidean graphs are mapped to a specific crossbar array (CBA) composed of self&#8208;rectifying memristors and metal cells at the diagonal positions. The sneak current, an intrinsic physical property in the CBA, allows for the identification of the similarity function. The sneak&#8208;current&#8208;based similarity function indicates the distance between the nodes, which can be used to predict the probability that unconnected nodes will be connected in the future, connectivity between communities, and neural connections in a brain. When all bit lines of the CBA are connected to the ground, the sneak current is suppressed, and the CBA can be used to search for adjacent nodes. This work demonstrates the physical calculation methods applied to various graphical problems&#160;using the CBA composed of the self&#8208;rectifying memristor based on the HfO2 switching layer. Moreover, such applications suffer less from the memristors&#8217; inherent issues related to their stochastic nature.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;Guaranteed High Carrier Mobility in Quasi&#8208;2D Thermoelectric Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The horizontal mirror symmetry in BaAgSb vanishes the electron&#8211;phonon coupling mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors, which weakens the phonon&#8208;induced carrier scattering and triggers a record hole mobility among polycrystalline quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectrics. Such high mobility accompanied with intrinsically low thermal conductivity gives rise to excellent p&#8208;type thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline BaAgSb.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, a route is proposed based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8211;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8722;1 S&#8722;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8776;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. This work uncovers the relation between electron&#8211;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), with terminal amino and carboxyl groups, passivates the surface defects and enhances the stability of the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite, therefore resulting in high sensitivity and highly stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors. In addition, the ATFBA&#8208;based photodetector has been integrated with a pulse oximetry visualization system, successfully yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.








Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA) is presented, which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, the Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52&#160;A&#160;W&#8208;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34&#160;&#215;&#160;1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector is integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. This work paves the avenue toward constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Replication and Transfer for Low&#8208;Cost, Sub&#8208;100&#160;nm Patterning of Materials on Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new additive patterning technique, named electrochemical replication and transfer, is developed to pattern a wide variety of metals, semiconductors, and polymers with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters on flexible substrates at low cost and high throughput.








Abstract
The fabrication of high&#8208;resolution patterns on flexible substrates is an essential step in the development of flexible electronics. However, the patterning process on flexible substrates often requires expensive equipment and tedious lithographic processing. Here, a bottom&#8208;up patterning technique, termed electrochemical replication and transfer (ERT) is reported, which fabricates multiscale patterns of a wide variety of materials by selective electrodeposition of target materials on a predefined template, and subsequent transfer of the electrodeposited materials to a flexible substrate, while leaving the undamaged template for reuse for over 100 times. The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub&#8208;100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade&#8208;off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.

The additive and parallel patterning attribute of ERT allows the fabrication of multiscale patterns with resolutions spanning from sub-100&#160;nm to many centimeters simultaneously, which overcomes the trade-off between resolution and throughput of conventional patterning techniques. ERT is suitable for fabricating a wide variety of materials including metals, semiconductors, metal oxides, and polymers into arbitrary shapes on flexible substrates at a very low cost.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Microribbon Scaffolds Induce Regenerative Innate and Adaptive Immune Responses in a Critical&#8208;Size Cranial Bone Defect Model</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane coating represents a biomimetic strategy for modifying the surface of biomaterials. Coating macroporous microribbon scaffolds with mesenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM) enhances cranial bone healing via immunomodulation. Primed MSCM&#8208;coating contains ligands that promote M&#966; polarization toward M2, induce Treg differentiation and TCD8+ apoptosis, and enhance MSC osteogenesis. MSCM coating synergizes with BMP&#8208;2 to further accelerate bone regeneration while suppressing inflammation.








Abstract
Naturally&#8208;derived cell membranes have shown great promise in functionalizing nanoparticles to enhance biointerfacing functions for drug delivery applications. However, its potential for functionalizing macroporous scaffolds to enhance tissue regeneration in vivo remains unexplored. Engineering scaffolds with immunomodulatory functions represents an exciting strategy for tissue regeneration but is largely limited to soft tissues. Critical&#8208;sized bone defects cannot heal on their own, and the role of adaptive immune cells in scaffold&#8208;mediated healing of cranial bone defects remains largely unknown. Here, mensenchymal stem cell membrane (MSCM)&#8208;coated microribbon (&#181;RB) scaffolds for treating critical size cranial bone defects via targeting immunomodulation are reported. Confocal imaging and proteomic analyses are used to confirm successful coating and characterize the compositions of cell membrane coating. It is demonstrated that MSCM coating promotes macrophage (M&#966;) polarization toward regenerative phenotype, induces CD8+ T cell apoptosis, and enhances regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo. When combined with a low dosage of BMP&#8208;2, MSCM coating further accelerates bone regeneration and suppresses inflammation. These results establish cell membrane&#8208;coated microribbon scaffolds as a promising strategy for treating critical size bone defects via immunomodulation. The platform may be broadly used with different cell membranes and scaffolds to enhance regeneration of multiple tissue types.

         <title>Multiplexed Ultrasensitive Sample&#8208;to&#8208;Answer RT&#8208;LAMP Chip for the Identification of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and Influenza Viruses</title>

         <dc:description>
An ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip operated by LED is developed to detect SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses simultaneously. The ultrafast target enrichment (&#8776;500&#215;) followed by autonomous elution and amplification via photothermal activation enables limit&#8208;of&#8208;detection of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The sensitive detection in point&#8208;of&#8208;care settings comparable to standard polymerase chain reaction allows timely management of various pandemic situations that may be faced shortly.








Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections will have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer loop&#8208;mediated isothermal amplification (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling is presented. First, the MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8776;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, the chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, the chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#181;L&#8722;1. The rapid, ultrasensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations that may be faced shortly.

         <title>A Super Tough, Rapidly Biodegradable, Ultrafast Hemostatic Bioglue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new bioglue is composed of amidated&#8208;gelatin and Tetra&#8208;PEG&#8208;SS for rapid hemostasis in massive hemorrhage. The amino terminals in gelatin quickly react with active ester moieties in the PEG&#8208;SS, endowing the amino&#8208;gelatin&#8208;PEG glue firm and indiscriminate adhesion with various moist tissues (e.g., adhesively sealing cardiac hemorrhagic wounds). The bioglue provides a fascinating hemostatic approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.








Abstract
Death happening due to massive hemorrhage has been involved in military conflicts, traffic accidents, and surgical injuries of various human disasters. Achieving rapid and effective hemostasis to save lives is crucial in urgent massive bleeding situations. Herein, a covalent cross&#8208;linked AG&#8208;PEG glue based on extracellular matrix&#8208;like amino&#8208;gelatin (AG) and PEG derivatives is developed. The AG&#8208;PEG glue gelatinizes fast and exhibits firm and indiscriminate close adhesion with various moist tissues upon being dosed. The formed glue establishes an adhesive and robust barrier to seal the arterial, hepatic, and cardiac hemorrhagic wounds, enabling it to withstand up to 380&#160;mmHg blood pressure in comparison with normal systolic blood pressure of 60&#8211;180&#160;mmHg. Remarkably, massive bleeding from a pig cardiac penetrating hole with 6&#160;mm diameter is effectively stopped using the glue within 60&#160;s. Postoperative indexes of the treated pig gradually recover and the cardiac wounds regrow significantly at 14&#160;days. Possessing on&#8208;demand solubility, self&#8208;gelling, and rapid degradability, the AG&#8208;PEG glue may provide a fascinating stop&#8208;bleeding approach for clinical hemostasis and emergency rescue.

         <title>Terahertz Nonlinear Hall Rectifiers Based on Spin&#8208;Polarized Topological Electronic States in&#160;1T&#8208;CoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;order nonlinear Hall effect response for high&#8208;efficiency terahertz rectification, is observed in the spin&#8208;polarized 1T&#8208;CoTe2, led by the zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#160;extrinsic contribution of topological electronic states. The Hall&#8208;rectifier, without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, shows up room&#8208;temperature responsivity of over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2, opening up device implementation based on quantum&#8208;wavefunction engineering.








Abstract
The zero&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) refers to the second&#8208;order transverse current induced by an applied alternating electric field; it indicates the topological properties of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking crystals. Despite several studies on the NLHE induced by the Berry&#8208;curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals, the direct current conversion by rectification is limited to very low driving frequencies and cryogenic temperatures. The nonlinear photoresponse generated by the NLHE at room temperature can be useful for numerous applications in communication, sensing, and photodetection across a high bandwidth. In this study, observations of the second&#8208;order NLHE in type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal CoTe2 under time&#8208;reversal symmetry are reported. This is determined by the disorder&#8208;induced extrinsic contribution on the broken&#8208;inversion&#8208;symmetry surface and room&#8208;temperature terahertz rectification without the need for semiconductor junctions or bias voltage. It is shown that remarkable photoresponsivity over 0.1 A W&#8722;1, a response time of approximately 710&#160;ns, and a mean noise equivalent power of 1 pW Hz&#8722;1/2 can be achieved at room temperature. The results open a new pathway for low&#8208;energy photon harvesting via nonlinear rectification induced by the NLHE in strongly spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled and inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking systems, promising a considerable impact in the field of infrared/terahertz photonics.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Ionizable Iron Nanoadjuvant Augments STING Activation for Personalized Vaccination Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) is developed to potentiate cancer vaccination immunotherapy. PEIM nanoadjuvant is coassembled from acid&#8208;ionizable&#160;copolymers with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) and a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist. PEIM nanoadjuvant effectively delivers tumor antigens to lymph nodes, amplifies STING activation and type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production, and ultimately&#160;elicits antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell response to inhibit tumor growth.








Abstract
The critical challenge for cancer vaccine&#8208;induced T&#8208;cell immunity is the sustained activation of antigen cross&#8208;presentation in antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) with innate immune stimulation. In this study, it is first discovered that the clinically used magnetic contrast agents, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), markedly augment the type&#8208;I interferon (IFN&#8208;I) production profile of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist MSA&#8208;2 and achieve a 16&#8208;fold dosage&#8208;sparing effect in the human STING haplotype. Acid&#8208;ionizable copolymers are coassembled with IONPs and MSA&#8208;2 into iron nanoadjuvants to concentrate STING activation in the draining lymph nodes. The top candidate iron nanoadjuvant (PEIM) efficiently delivers the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) to CD169+ APCs and facilitates antigen cross&#8208;presentation to elicit a 55&#8208;fold greater frequency of antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ cytotoxic T&#8208;lymphocyte response than soluble antigen. PEIM@OVA nanovaccine immunization induces potent and durable antitumor immunity to prevent tumor lung metastasis and eliminate established tumors. Moreover, PEIM nanoadjuvant is applicable to deliver autologous tumor antigen and synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade therapy for prevention of postoperative tumor recurrence and distant metastasis in B16&#8208;OVA melanoma and MC38 colorectal tumor models. The acid&#8208;ionizable iron nanoadjuvant offers a generalizable and readily translatable strategy to augment STING cascade activation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation for personalized cancer vaccination immunotherapy.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous steel structures combining ultralow weight and high mechanical efficiency are manufactured by printing, reducing, and sintering wet foams containing iron oxide precursor particles. By forming new load&#8208;bearing struts when compressed, the porous structures are able to reversibly stiffen in response to nonuniform stresses, a behavior that conceptually resembles the unique adaptive properties of human bone.








Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reduce the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, it is shown that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness are manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of 3D printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths are studied. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>A Flexible, High&#8208;Voltage (&gt;100&#160;V) Generating Device Based on Zebra&#8208;Like Asymmetrical Photovoltaic Cascade</title>

         <dc:description>
Gold/aluminum micro&#8208;strips repeat along a specific direction and periodically form overlaps and gaps in a head&#8208;to&#8208;tail manner like the patterns of a zebra. After compounding with semiconducting supramolecular nanowires, an output voltage of 140&#160;V can be achieved on a flexible substrate upon illumination.








Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal that can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework, it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in&#160;specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here, a nano&#8208;fabrication technology has been devised featuring double self&#8208;alignment that is applied to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunction arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which covers a surface area of 5&#160;&#215;&#160;4&#160;mm2 and contains 500 periodic repeating units, is capable of photo generating voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

         <title>Photoredox&#8208;Promoted Co&#8208;Production of Dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2 over Defective Zn3In2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;functional and defective Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst is developed for the simultaneous efficient photocatalytic co&#8208;syntheses of dihydroisoquinoline and H2O2, which shows the highest rate for both reactions up to date.








Abstract
One of the most sustainable and promising approaches for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in a low&#8208;cost and environment&#8208;friendly way is photosynthesis, which, however, suffers from poor carrier utilization and low H2O2 productivity. The addition of proton donors such as isopropanol or ethanol can increase H2O2 production, which, unfortunately, will inevitably elevate the entire cost while wasting the oxidizing power of holes (h+). Herein, the tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs) is employed as a distinctive proton donor for the thermodynamically feasible and selective semi&#8208;dehydrogenation reaction to highly valuable dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs), and meanwhile, to couple with and promote H2O2 generation in one photoredox reaction under the photocatalysis by dual&#8208;functional Zn3In2S6 photocatalyst. Surprisingly, the suitably defective Zn3In2S6 offers an excellent and near&#8208;stoichiometric co&#8208;production performance of H2O2 and DHIQs at unprecedentedly high rates of 66.4 and 62.1&#160;mmol h&#8208;1 g&#8208;1 under visible light (&#955;&#160;&#8805; 400&#160;nm), respectively, which outperforms all the previously available reports even though sacrificial agents&#160;were&#160;employed in those reports. Additionally, photocatalytic redox reaction mechanism demonstrates that H2O2 can be generated through multiple pathways, highlighting the synergistic effect among ROS (&#183;O2&#8208; and 1O2), h+ and proton donor, which has been ignored in previous studies.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Wavelength Light&#8208;Responsive Metal&#8211;Phenolic Network&#8208;Based Microrobots for Reactive Species Scavenging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a hollow metal&#8211;phenolic network&#8208;based microrobot with spray&#8208;coated asymmetric capping is reported capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared irradiation and ultraviolet irradiation without fuel. With multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsiveness, tunable size of the particles, and great reactive oxygen and nitrogen species scavenging capacity, the proposed microrobots can be ideal for future in vivo analytical sensing and medical treatment.








Abstract
Light&#8208;driven microrobots with different propulsion mechanisms have attracted great attention in microrobot synthesis and applications. However, current systems rely heavily on precious metals, using a complex synthesis process and limited working wavelength. It is therefore of great interest to fabricate microrobots that can be driven by multi&#8208;wavelength irradiation and with simple components. Here, metal&#8211;phenolic network (MPN)&#8208;based microrobots are synthesized using a sacrificial polystyrene bead template and an extra capping is added to regulate their symmetry. The hollow MPN microrobots with different layers of capping are capable of moving under both near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, without fuel. The velocity of the microrobots under irradiation is altered by the thickness of the asymmetric capping and their motion could be manipulated remotely by switching the NIR or UV irradiation on and off. With light&#8208;driven mobility, the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) scavenging activity of the microrobots is significantly increased. Therefore, this proposed microrobot system provides a synthesis strategy to develop asymmetric light&#8208;navigated microrobots for future medical treatment with tunable structure, multi&#8208;wavelength light&#8208;responsive mobility, and great RONS scavenging capacity.

         <title>Coordination Polymer Electrocatalysts Enable Efficient CO&#8208;to&#8208;Acetate Conversion</title>

Integrating a coordination polymer catalyst consisting of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50%, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Upgrading carbon dioxide/monoxide to multi&#8208;carbon C2+ products using renewable electricity offers one route to more sustainable fuel and chemical production. One of the most appealing products is acetate, the profitable electrosynthesis of which demands a catalyst with higher efficiency. Here, a coordination polymer (CP) catalyst is reported that consists of Cu(I) and benzimidazole units linked via Cu(I)&#8208;imidazole coordination bonds, which enables selective reduction of CO to acetate with a 61% Faradaic efficiency at &#8722;0.59 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode at a current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in flow cells. The catalyst is integrated in a cation exchange membrane&#8208;based membrane electrode assembly that enables stable acetate electrosynthesis for 190&#160;h, while achieving direct collection of concentrated acetate (3.3 molar) from the cathodic liquid stream, an average single&#8208;pass utilization of 50% toward CO&#8208;to&#8208;acetate conversion, and an average acetate full&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 15% at a current density of 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Antiglycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A glucose&#8208;responsive polymer is designed, considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells. The polymer exhibits micellar&#8208;structure stability during blood circulation and accumulates in tumor tissues. Specific binding between the polymer and intracellular glucose induces glucose deprivation in tumor cells. Glucose metabolism is particularly inhibited; the lack of energy in tumor cells is intensified, leading to tumor suppression.








Abstract
A new anticancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported. An antiglycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anticancer drugs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Nanocrystalline Structures from Freestanding Oxide Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scientific exploration of nanomaterials has led to massive growth in understanding and applications of quantum materials at the nanoscale. A route for fabrication of nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality utilizing self&#8208;assembly of freestanding membranes transferred on appropriate substrates is presented. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry after self&#8208;assembly.








Abstract
The exploration of crystalline nanostructures enhances the understanding of quantum phenomena occurring in spatially confined quantum matter and may lead to functional materials with unforeseen applications. A novel route to fabricating nanocrystalline oxide structures of exceptional quality is presented. This is achieved by utilizing a self&#8208;assembly process of ultrathin membranes composed of the desired oxide. The thermally induced self&#8208;assembly of nanocrystalline structures is driven by dewetting the oxide membranes once they are lifted off and transferred onto sapphire surfaces. In three successive steps, the process provides nanovoids, nanowires, and nanocrystals. Regardless of substrate orientation, the nanostructures are highly anisotropic in shape due to material retraction favoring low&#8208;index crystalline lattice directions of the membranes. The orientation of the nanostructures is provided precisely by the crystal lattice of the transferred membrane. The microstructure of the nanocrystals exhibits exceptional quality, characterized by a pristine crystal structure and uniform stoichiometry, both maintained all the way down to the well&#8208;developed crystalline facets. The demonstrated self&#8208;assembly process holds the potential to improve the understanding of surface diffusion phenomena at the interface of materials, which is important for advancing epitaxial growth technology and paves the way to fabricating crystalline nanostructures by the transfer and self&#8208;assembly of membranes.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capacitive strain sensors are theoretically limited in their sensitivity. In this work, stretchable and flexible strain sensors are fabricated using a helical auxetic yarn structure providing access to auxetic character in the fiber form. The helical auxetic capacitive sensors (HACS) are able to access sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit, determined to be because of an engulfment phenomenon that occurs as a result of the materials employed and the auxetic character.








Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e., gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which has improved the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. In this work, the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors is presented. It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.

It is found that the response of the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (termed as HACS) is dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8212;the ratio of diameters and the helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, sensors that respond to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values can be obtained. A greater auxetic character results in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8212;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far is obtained. A mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally is proposed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically thin MoS2 electrical switches are characterized for the first time in operando and in ambient conditions through a non&#8208;invasive spectroscopy&#8208;based method. The study sheds light on the &#8211; controversial and still debated &#8211; dynamics driving the switching mechanism. It reveals volatile metallic filaments percolating interatomic spacing in MoS2 and stresses the impact of transfer residues on the electrical performance of switches.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultralow switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nanoimaging of devices in operando. Here, three optical techniques are combined to perform the first noninvasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. This study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. A &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2 is observed, which suggests that nonvolatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. These findings provide a crucial understanding of nanoprocess in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive filaments (CFs) with different morphologies after forming, set, and reset operations are clearly revealed in HfOx&#8208;based memristors by the 3D reconstruction of c&#8208;AFM technique. Multiple conductive filaments are successfully observed in the devices with three different resistive states. The rupture location of CFs after reset is also observed clearly.








Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set, and reset&#8212;are clearly revealed for the first time by 3D reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM) images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs are successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;Locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking dissolvable microneedle is presented as a mass&#8208;producible and cost&#8208;effective transdermal drug delivery platform for precise microdose delivery of drugs in a minimally invasive manner. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a novel combination immunotherapy approach proposed to improve melanoma treatment efficacy shows a significantly higher efficacy when delivered via self&#8208;locking microneedles than intratumoral injection.








Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) are mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy is evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and comparing them with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (aPD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirms significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is reported for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging, which is accomplished through both glutathione/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues.








Abstract
Glutathione (GSH)&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular GSH enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide is shown for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumors and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8776; 0.12&#160;mm for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in&#160;tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin in the tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance, and surgical guidance.

The introduction of electron exchangeable binding sites comprising thiophene S and oxidized S, adjacent to Fe single atom electrocatalysts, improves Li2S redox kinetics by modulating d&#8208;orbital level of Fe single atom via electron exchange. These specially designed electrocatalysts enable realization of a 1 A h level Li&#8211;S pouch cell with high gravimetric energy density and long cycle stability.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) is reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multistacked Li&#8211;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8776;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), and N/P (2.3) ratios and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC is designed by manipulating its local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8211;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8211;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs promotes the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8211;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8211;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8211;SO2/&#8211;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

         <title>Modular Approach to Creating Functionalized Surface Arrays of Molecular Qubits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method to create 2D arrays of molecular spin qubits is reported. The quantum properties are retained and the quantum coherence times are improved compared to bulk conditions.








Abstract
The quest for developing quantum technologies is driven by the promise of exponentially faster computations, ultrahigh performance sensing, and achieving thorough understanding of many&#8208;particle quantum systems. Molecular spins are excellent qubit candidates because they feature long coherence times, are widely tunable through chemical synthesis, and can be interfaced with other quantum platforms such as superconducting qubits. A present challenge for molecular spin qubits is their integration in quantum devices, which requires arranging them in thin films or monolayers on surfaces. However, clear proof of the survival of quantum properties of molecular qubits on surfaces has not been reported so far. Furthermore, little is known about the change in spin dynamics of molecular qubits going from the bulk to monolayers. Here, a versatile bottom&#8208;up method is reported to arrange molecular qubits as functional groups of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) on surfaces, combining molecular self&#8208;organization and click chemistry. Coherence times of up to 13 &#181;s demonstrate that qubit properties are maintained or even enhanced in the monolayer.

         <title>Solvation and Interfacial Engineering Enable &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C Operation of Graphite/NCM Batteries at Energy Density over 270 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic barriers related to Li+ transport at low temperatures is knocked down by formulating a weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte containing Na+ as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, where a Li&#8208;Na hybrid SEI is identified to favor Li+ migration through the multiple LiF/NaF grain boundaries. As such, the electrolyte affords a 2 Ah, 270&#160;Wh&#160;Kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM523 pouch cell with discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) that can operate under low temperature (LT) conditions are essential for applications in orbital missions, subsea areas, and electric vehicles. Unfortunately, severe capacity loss is witnessed due to tremendous kinetic barriers that emerge at LT. Herein, to surmount such kinetic limitations, a low dielectric environment is tamed throughout the bulk electrolyte, which efficaciously brought the Li+ desolvation energy down to 30.76 kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1. At the meantime, the adoption of sodium cations (Na+) is proposed as a hetero&#8208;cation additive, and a Li&#8208;Na hybrid and fluoride&#8208;rich interphase is further identified via preferential reduction of Na+&#8208;(solvent/anion) clusters, which is found to efficiently facilitate Li+ migration through the LiF/NaF grain boundaries. Based on a N/P ratio of 1.1, the graphite/LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) full cell (cathode loading of &#8776;18.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) delivers a capacity as high as 125.1 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C with prolonged cycling to 100 cycles. Finally, a 270&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 graphite/NCM pouch cell is assembled, which affords a discharge capacity of 108.7 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 under &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C during the initial cycles. With an eye to both fundamental and practical aspects, this work will propel additional advancements and allow LIBs to fill more roles under extreme operation temperatures than ever before.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Reaction Heterogeneity During Calcination of Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calcination used for Li&#8208;ion battery particle synthesis is chemically imaged. Various parallel and serial combinations of heterogeneous reactions, such as the thermal aerobic/anaerobic decomposition, Li2CO3 decomposition, Li2&#8208;O insertion/diffusion, and O2 insertion/diffusion, prevail during the calcination reaction. The anaerobic decomposition of the precursor core slows down Li2&#8208;O incorporation.








Abstract
During solid&#8208;state calcination, with increasing temperature, materials undergo complex phase transitions with heterogeneous solid&#8208;state reactions and mass transport. Precise control of the calcination chemistry is therefore crucial for synthesizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides (LiNi1&#8208;x&#8208;yCoxMnyO2, NRNCM) as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Although the battery performance depends on the chemical heterogeneity during NRNCM calcination, it has not yet been elucidated. Herein, through synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray, mass spectrometry microscopy, and structural analyses, it is revealed that the temperature&#8208;dependent reaction kinetics, the diffusivity of solid&#8208;state lithium sources, and the ambient oxygen control the local chemical compositions of the reaction intermediates within a calcined particle. Additionally, it is found that the variations in the reducing power of the transition metals (i.e., Ni, Co, and Mn) determine the local structures at the nanoscale. The investigation of the reaction mechanism via imaging analysis provides valuable information for tuning the calcination chemistry and developing high&#8208;energy/power density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>In Situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;Area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>

         <dc:description>
In situ absorption measurement is used to investigate the aggregation behavior of acceptors during slot&#8208;die&#8208;coating. The 1 cm2 flexible device can reach a power conversion efficiency of 13.70%, with excellent shelf stability and upscaling ability. The connected modules (180 cm2) can effectively power a smartphone, showing great potential for future applications.








Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin&#8208;coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. In situ absorption spectroscopy indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1&#8208;based 1&#160;cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

However, the photovoltaic performance of large-area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin-coating devices.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intermolecular interactions are ubiquitous and elusive in organic solar cells. Herein, the complicated relationship between multidimensional intermolecular interactions in active layers and photovoltaic performance is disclosed. The results show that complex interactions are critical to synergistically regulating comprehensive properties, including molecular assembly, stacking orientations, charge transport, and morphology management, which helps to achieve an efficiency over 19% in ternary devices.








Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers is investigated. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibit stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6&#160;and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibit moderate donor/acceptor interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helps to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors are over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors show appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23&#160;further optimizes multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which results in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

Capacitive Strain Sensors
In article number 2209321, Tyler J. Cuthbert, Carlo Menon, and co&#8208;workers present a novel capacitive strain sensor that accesses sensitivity beyond the theoretical limit. The helical auxetic capacitive sensor (HACS) employs a two&#8208;component yarn structure allowing tuneable sensitivity and accessible strain ranges. The HACS sensitivity is found to be from an engulfment phenomenon, which is predicted with a geometric model and analyzed by X&#8208;ray &#956;CT scanning.

Nonlinear Hall Effect
As the heart and with the tremendous applications of terahertz technology, photodetectors suffer from considerable drawbacks imposed by weak optical absorption, and inefficient charge&#8208;separation mechanisms. In article number 2209557, Antonio Politano, Lin Wang, and co&#8208;workers report the nonlinear Hall effect operating at terahertz frequencies within strong spin&#8208;polarized topological states in CoTe2 without invoking any semiconductor junctions or bias voltage, opening up fascinating route toward quantum wavefunction engineering.

Cathode Calcination
In article number 2207076, Sugeun Jo, Keeyoung Jung, Jongwoo Lim, and co&#8208;workers show how solid&#8208;state reaction heterogeneity affects the high&#8208;temperature calcination of Li&#8208;ion battery particles. Various parallel and serial combinations of the thermal (an)aerobic decomposition and Li2&#8211;O insertion/diffusion are chemically imaged during the calcination reaction. The cover image features the calcination intermediates that facilitate the surface Li2&#8211;O incorporation, which is impeded by the anaerobically decomposed phase in the particle core.

         <title>As Fiber Meets with AIE: Opening a Wonderland for Smart Flexible Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and fiber complement each other for making remarkble progress in smart flexible materials. This article provides a comprehensive and fundamental overview of the basic concepts, structure&#8208;function relationship, seminal and recent studies, and the potential directions for future developments regarding AIEgen&#8208;based fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecules into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary of the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. The most representative applications are then highlighted by focusing on energy conversion, personal protective equipment, biomedical, sensor, and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities, and tendencies in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>Photoresponsive Supramolecular Polymers: From Light&#8208;Controlled Small Molecules to Smart Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 10, March 9, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Control over supramolecular interactions is an important part of the toolbox for developing functional materials. The design of supramolecular polymers with light&#8208;triggered molecules allows remote control of supramolecular polymers and materials with high spatiotemporal precision. Here, a perspective review of various approaches and major advances toward photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with controlled functions is presented.








Abstract
Photoresponsive supramolecular polymers are well&#8208;organized assemblies based on highly oriented and reversible noncovalent interactions containing photosensitive molecules as (co&#8208;)monomers. They have attracted increasing interest in smart materials and dynamic systems with precisely controllable functions, such as light&#8208;driven soft actuators, photoresponsive fluorescent anticounterfeiting and light&#8208;triggered electronic devices. The present review discusses light&#8208;activated molecules used in photoresponsive supramolecular polymers with their main photo&#8208;induced changes, e.g., geometry, dipole moment, and chirality. Based on these distinct changes, supramolecular polymers formed by light&#8208;activated molecules exhibit photoresponsive disassembly and reassembly. As a consequence, photo&#8208;induced supramolecular polymerization, &#8220;depolymerization,&#8221; and regulation of the lengths and topologies are observed. Moreover, the light&#8208;controlled functions of supramolecular polymers, such as actuation, emission, and chirality transfer along length scales, are highlighted. Furthermore, a perspective on challenges and future opportunities is presented. Besides the challenge of moving from harmful UV light to visible/near IR light avoiding fatigue, and enabling biomedical applications, future opportunities include light&#8208;controlled supramolecular actuators with helical motion, light&#8208;modulated information transmission, optically recyclable materials, and multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular systems.

         <title>Upcycling of Waste Plastic into Hybrid Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mixed waste plastic can be efficiently upcycled to carbon nanotubes and hybrid nanomaterials. The products&#160;have controllable morphologies, and can be synthesized in solvent&#8208; and inert gas&#8208;free methods. These nanomaterials outperform commercial multiwalled carbon nanotubes in vinyl ester composites, and life&#8208;cycle assessment demonstrates 86&#8211;94% improvements in greenhouse gas emissions and energy demand, compared to current nanotube production routes.








Abstract
Graphitic 1D&#160;and hybrid nanomaterials represent a powerful solution in composite and electronic applications due to exceptional properties, but large&#8208;scale synthesis of hybrid materials has yet to be realized. Here, a rapid, scalable method to produce graphitic 1D materials from polymers using flash Joule heating (FJH) is reported. This avoids lengthy chemical vapor deposition and uses no solvent or water. The flash 1D materials (F1DM), synthesized using a variety of earth&#8208;abundant catalysts, have controllable diameters and morphologies by parameter tuning. Furthermore, the process can be modified to form hybrid materials, with F1DM bonded to turbostratic graphene. In nanocomposites, F1DM outperform&#160;commercially available carbon nanotubes. Compared to current 1D material synthetic strategies using life cycle assessment, FJH synthesis represents an 86&#8211;92% decrease in cumulative energy demand and 92&#8211;94% decrease in global&#8208;warming potential. This work suggests that FJH affords a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable route to upcycle waste plastic into valuable 1D and hybrid nanomaterials.

         <title>Exsolution Modeling and Control to Improve the Catalytic Activity of Nanostructured Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution behavior and its mechanism are demonstrated by controlling and modeling particle growth. Following this model, a highly active and durable nanostructured electrode for solid oxide fuel cells using an in situ exsolution method is developed. The particle growth of the exsolved Ni nanoparticles is enhanced by electrochemical switching,leading to a drastic improvement in cell performance.








Abstract
In situ exsolution for nanoscale electrode design has attracted considerable attention because of its promising activity and high stability. However, fundamental research on the mechanisms underlying particle growth remains insufficient. Herein, cation&#8208;diffusion&#8208;determined exsolution is presented using an analytical model based on classical nucleation and diffusion. In the designed perovskite system, the exsolution trend for particle growth is consistent with this diffusion model, which strongly depends on the initial cation concentration and reduction conditions. Based on the experimental and theoretical results, a highly Ni&#8208;doped anode and an electrochemical switching technique are employed to promote exsolution and overcome growth limitations. The optimal cell exhibits an outstanding maximum power density of 1.7&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 900&#160;&#176;C and shows no evident degradation when operating at 800&#160;&#176;C for 240&#160;h under wet H2. This study provides crucial insights into the developing and tuning of heterogeneous catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Strong Interlayer Coupling in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strong interlayer&#8208;coupled WSe2/WSe2 homostructure is grown by chemical vapor deposition&#160;using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted approach to overcome the stacking&#8208;free energy, showing a uniform moir&#233; superlattice and strong interfacial coupling. The interlayer coupling can be adjusted by altering the twist angle, enabling the investigation of a variety of novel physical phenomena, which is expected to realize single&#8208;photon emission and promote the development of coherent quantum light emitters.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices in twisted van der Waals materials offer a powerful platform for exploring light&#8211;matter interactions. The periodic moir&#233; potentials in moir&#233; superlattices can induce strongly correlated quantum phenomena that depend on the moir&#233; potential associated with interlayer coupling at the interface. However, moir&#233; superlattices are primarily prepared by mechanical exfoliation and manual stacking, where the transfer methods easily cause interfacial contamination, and the preparation of high&#8208;quality bilayer 2D materials with small twist angles by growth methods remains a significant challenge. In this work, WSe2/WSe2 homobilayers with different twist angles by chemical vapor deposition (CVD),&#160;using a heteroatom&#8208;assisted growth technique, are synthesized. Using low&#8208;frequency Raman scattering, the uniformity of the moir&#233; superlattices is mapped to demonstrate the strong interfacial coupling of the CVD&#8208;fabricated twist&#8208;angle homobilayers. The moir&#233; potential depths of the CVD&#8208;grown and artificially stacked homostructures with twist angles of 1.5&#176; are 115 and 45 meV (an increase of 155%), indicating that the depth of moir&#233; potential can be modulated by the interfacial coupling. These results open a new avenue to study the modulation of moir&#233; potential by strong interlayer coupling and provide a foundation for the development of twistronics.

         <title>Improving OFF&#8208;State Bias&#8208;Stress Stability in High&#8208;Mobility Conjugated Polymer Transistors with an Antisolvent Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Treatment of the conjugated polymer indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole by acetonitrile (AN) or n&#8208;butyl acetate (NBA) antisolvent slightly enhances the crystallinity of the films as evidenced by grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction (left) and leads to an improved OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress stability of organic field&#8208;effect transistors with respect to untreated reference films (right).








Abstract
Conjugated polymer field&#8208;effect transistors are emerging as an enabling technology for flexible electronics due to their excellent mechanical properties combined with sufficiently high charge&#8208;carrier mobilities and compatibility with large&#8208;area, low&#8208;temperature processing. However, their electrical stability remains a concern. ON&#8208;state (accumulation mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities in organic semiconductors have been widely studied, and multiple mitigation strategies have been suggested. In contrast, OFF&#8208;state (depletion mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities remain poorly understood despite being crucial for many applications in which the transistors are held in their OFF&#8208;state for most of the time. Here, a simple method of using an antisolvent treatment is presented to achieve significant improvements in OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress and environmental stability as well as general device performance for one of the best performing polymers, solution&#8208;processable indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDT&#8208;BT). IDT&#8208;BT is weakly crystalline, and the notable improvements to an antisolvent&#8208;induced, increased degree of crystallinity, resulting in a lower probability of electron trapping and the removal of charge traps is attributed. The work highlights the importance of the microstructure in weakly crystalline polymer films and offers a simple processing strategy for achieving the reliability required for applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydration Activates Dual&#8208;Confined Shape&#8208;Memory Effects of Cold&#8208;Reprogrammable Photonic Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The water&#8208;activated dual confined shape&#8208;memory effects (CSMEs) of cold&#8208;programmable photonic crystals are revealed, manifesting ethanol&#8208;vapor&#8208;triggered selective shape recovery resulting from water&#8208;induced interchain H&#8208;bonds reconstruction and structural color locking derived from pressure&#8208;guided interchain H&#8208;bonds remodeling. Activatable CSME contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory photonic crystals (SMPCs) transform the nanoscale deformation of copolymers into structural color through an undifferentiated response to stimuli; however, activatable selective responses are extremely rare. Herein, activatable dual confined shape&#8208;memory effects (CSMEs) derived from the remodeling of the interchain hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds) in cold&#8208;programmable SMPCs are revealed. The first level is the water&#8208;triggered reconstruction&#160;of interchain H&#8208;bonds, which can activate/lock the collapsed skeleton, showing shape recovery/retention in response to ethanol vapor. The second level is the pressure&#8208;induced reorganization of&#160;interchain H&#8208;bonds that results in the recovered skeleton being locked even when exposed to ethanol vapor or water, while the background porous structure can switch between collapse and recovery. Dual CSMEs result from the Laplace pressure difference and the binding effect of interchain H&#8208;bonds in the skeleton according to insights of swelling, in situ deformation tracking, multidimensional infrared spectra, and water wetting/evaporation simulations. The signal interference, source code extraction, and color enhancement of structurally colored patterns can be implemented using CSMEs. This work opens up a new method for fabricating activatable responsive structural color and contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.

This work opens up a new method for fabricating activatable responsive structural color and contributes to the expansion of nanophotonic technology in water printing, erasable watermarks, signal amplifiers, and information coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Thrombin&#8208;Activated Peptide&#8208;Templated Nanozyme for Remedying Ischemic Stroke via Thrombolytic and Neuroprotective Actions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme integrating thrombolytic and reactive oxygen species scavenging abilities is developed for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Through the self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the nanozyme binds fibrin in the thrombus, crosses the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulates in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke (IS) is one of the most common causes of disability and death. Thrombolysis and neuroprotection are two current major therapeutic strategies to overcome ischemic and reperfusion damage. In this work, a novel peptide&#8208;templated manganese dioxide nanozyme (PNzyme/MnO2) is designed that integrates the thrombolytic activity of functional peptides with the reactive oxygen species scavenging ability of nanozymes. Through self&#8208;assembled polypeptides that contain multiple functional motifs, the novel peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme is able to bind fibrin in the thrombus, cross the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and finally accumulate in the ischemic neuronal tissues, where the thrombolytic motif is &#8220;switched&#8208;on&#8221; by the action of thrombin. In mice and rat IS models, the PNzyme/MnO2 prolongs the blood&#8208;circulation time and exhibits strong thrombolytic action, and reduces the ischemic damages in brain tissues. Moreover, this peptide&#8208;templated nanozyme also effectively inhibits the activation of astrocytes and the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. These data indicate that the rationally designed PNzyme/MnO2 nanozyme exerts both thrombolytic and neuroprotective actions. Giving its long half&#8208;life in the blood and ability to target brain thrombi, the biocompatible nanozyme may serve as a novel therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy and prevent secondary thrombosis during the treatment of IS.

         <title>Vacancy Defects in 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Electrocatalysts: From Aggregated to Atomic Configuration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fundamentals, progress, and prospects of vacancy engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides toward electrocatalytic applications are reviewed. Vacancy manufacturing strategies, characterization techniques, and unique roles in electrocatalysis are considered, and the evolution of vacancy configuration from aggregated to atomic distribution is comprehensively discussed. The lifetime dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations of vacancy&#8208;mediated electrocatalysts are also highlighted.








Abstract
Vacancy defect engineering has been well leveraged to flexibly shape comprehensive physicochemical properties of diverse catalysts. In particular, growing research effort has been devoted to engineering chalcogen anionic vacancies (S/Se/Te) of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) toward the ultimate performance limit of electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In spite of remarkable progress achieved in the past decade, systematic and in&#8208;depth insights into the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacancy engineering for 2D&#8208;TMDs&#8208;based electrocatalysis are still lacking. Herein, this review delivers a full picture of vacancy engineering evolving from aggregated to atomic configurations covering their development background, controllable manufacturing, thorough characterization, and representative HER application. Of particular interest, the deep&#8208;seated correlations between specific vacancy regulation routes and resulting catalytic performance improvement are logically clarified in terms of atomic rearrangement, charge redistribution, energy band variation, intermediate adsorption&#8211;desorption optimization, and charge/mass transfer facilitation. Beyond that, a broader vision is cast into the cutting&#8208;edge research fields of vacancy&#8208;engineering&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysis and dynamic structure&#8211;performance correlations across catalyst service lifetime. Together with critical discussion on residual challenges and future prospects, this review sheds new light on the rational design of advanced defect catalysts and navigates their broader application in high&#8208;efficiency energy conversion and storage fields.

         <title>An In&#160;Situ Fabricated Graphene/Bipolar Polymer Hybrid Material Delivers Ultralong Cycle Life over 15&#160;000 Cycles as a High&#8208;Performance Electrode Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene/bipolar polymer hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) is in&#160;situ fabricated through a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal method. The Fc&#8208;DAB component provides high capacity and stability, while the 3D interconnected conductive graphene network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with fast ions/electrons diffusion and thus improved rate performance. Therefore, combined together, the material exhibits simultaneously high capacity, ultralong cycle life, and superior rate performance.








Abstract
Organic electrode materials are promising for the future energy storage systems owing to their tunable structures, abundant resources, and environmental friendliness. Many advanced lithium&#8208;ion batteries with organic electrodes have been developed and show excellent performance. However, developing organic materials with overall superior performance still faces great challenges, such as low capacity, poor stability, inferior conductivity, and low utilization of active sites. To address these issues, a bipolar polymer (Fc&#8208;DAB) is designed and further polymerized in&#160;situ with three&#8208;dimensional graphene (3DG), offering a hybrid material (Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG) with a variety of merits. Fc&#8208;DAB possesses stable polymer backbone and multiple redox&#8208;active sites that can improve stability and capacity simultaneously. The embedded highly conductive 3DG network endows Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG with stable conductive framework, large surface area, and porous morphology all together, so the fast diffusion of ions/electrons can be achieved, leading to high utilization of active sites and enhanced electrochemical performance. As a result, Fc&#8208;DAB@3DG cathode delivers capacity of &#8776;260&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 25&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1, ultra&#8208;long cycle life over 15&#160;000 cycles at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1 with retention of 99.999% per cycle, and remarkable rate performance. The quasi&#8208;solid Li&#8208;metal battery and full cell fabricated using this material also exhibit superior electrochemical performance.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;based nanomaterials have unique features to be used in tumor traceable immunotherapy in the form of nanocarriers, immunomodulators, and immunoactivators. This review focuses on the recent progress of Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy. It is highly anticipated that Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy can open up a promising avenue in nanomedicine.








Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and show versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: 1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; 2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; 3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; 4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

         <title>Hexaindium Heptasulfide/Nitrogen and Sulfur Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Hollow Microspindles with Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Sodium Storage through Stable Conversion and Alloying Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous and hollow In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon microspindles with fast, reversible, and durable Na+&#8208;storage properties can bridge the kinetics gap with capacitive porous carbon, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor with an energy density up to 136.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a power density up to 47.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1 as well as a long&#8208;term cycling stability.








Abstract
Group IIIA&#8211;VA metal sulfides (GMSs) have attracted increasing attention because of their unique Na&#8208;storage mechanisms through combined conversion and alloying reactions, thus delivering large theoretical capacities and low working potentials. However, Na+ diffusion within GMSs anodes leads to severe volume change, generally representing a fundamental limitation to rate capability and cycling stability. Here, monodispersed In6S7/nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon hollow microspindles (In6S7/NSC HMS) are produced by morphology&#8208;preserved thermal sulfurization of spindle&#8208;like and porous indium&#8208;based metal organic frameworks. The resulting In6S7/NSC HMS anode exhibits theoretical&#8208;value&#8208;close specific capacity (546.2 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), ultrahigh rate capability (267.5&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 30.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), high initial coulombic efficiency (&#8776;93.5%), and &#8776;92.6% capacity retention after 4000 cycles. This kinetically favored In6S7/NSC HMS anode fills up the kinetics gap with a capacitive porous carbon cathode, enabling a sodium&#8208;ion capacitor to deliver an ultrahigh energy density of 136.3&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and a maximum power density of 47.5&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1. The in situ/ex situ analytical techniques and theoretical calculation both show that the robust and fast Na+ charge storage of In6S7/NSC HMS arises from the multi&#8208;electron redox mechanism, buffered volume expansion, negligible morphological change, and surface&#8208;controlled solid&#8208;state Na+ transport.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reviews the latest research progress on artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials. The neuronal dynamics demonstrated in these devices, the hardware implementation of various artificial neural networks, and their potentials in computational and sensing applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Artificial neuronal devices are critical building blocks of neuromorphic computing systems and currently the subject of intense research motivated by application needs from new computing technology and more realistic brain emulation. Researchers have proposed a range of device concepts that can mimic neuronal dynamics and functions. Although the switching physics and device structures of these artificial neurons are largely different, their behaviors can be described by several neuron models in a more unified manner. In this paper, the reports of artificial neuronal devices based on emerging volatile switching materials are reviewed from the perspective of the demonstrated neuron models, with a focus on the neuronal functions implemented in these devices and the exploitation of these functions for computational and sensing applications. Furthermore, the neuroscience inspirations and engineering methods to enrich the neuronal dynamics that remain to be implemented in artificial neuronal devices and networks toward realizing the full functionalities of biological neurons are discussed.

         <title>Fluid Flow Templating of Polymeric Soft Matter with Diverse Morphologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile nanofabrication processes, where liquid flow templates polymer solvent&#8211;nonsolvent precipitation, can produce at least 12&#160;distinct soft matter morphologies at micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;scale. These structures range from spheroids, rods, fibers, ribbons, and dendricolloids, to sheets. Systematic understanding of fluid templating enables robust control over the resulting micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;structures, which can be produced from a broad variety of (bio) polymers.








Abstract
It is challenging&#160;to find a conventional nanofabrication technique that can consistently produce soft polymeric matter of high surface area and nanoscale morphology in a way that is scalable, versatile, and easily tunable. Here, the capabilities of a universal method for fabricating diverse nano&#8208; and micro&#8208;scale morphologies based on polymer precipitation templated by the fluid streamlines in multiphasic flow are explored. It is shown that while the procedure is operationally simple, various combinations of its intertwined mechanisms can controllably and reproducibly lead to the formation of an extraordinary wide range of colloidal morphologies. By systematically investigating the process conditions, 12&#160;distinct classes of polymer micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures including particles, rods, ribbons, nanosheets, and soft dendritic colloids (dendricolloids) are identified. The outcomes are interpreted by delineating the physical processes into three stages: hydrodynamic shear, capillary and mechanical breakup, and polymer precipitation rate. The insights into the underlying fundamental mechanisms provide guidance toward developing a versatile and scalable nanofabrication platform. It is verified that the liquid shear&#8208;based technique is versatile and works well with many chemically diverse polymers and biopolymers, showing potential as a universal tool for simple and scalable nanofabrication of many morphologically distinct soft matter classes.

         <title>Reshaping the Endogenous Electric Field to Boost Wound Repair via Electrogenerative Dressing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive electrogenerative dressing (EGD) is designed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with negative&#8208;pressure wound therapy, which makes a great breakthrough in wound repair and scar prevention with clinical transformation potential. The EGD accelerates the polarization of macrophages to M2 macrophages, strengthens cell proliferation and migration, augments angiogenesis and reepithelialization, enhances orientation of collagen, and reduces scars.








Abstract
The endogenous electric field (EF) generated by transepithelial potential difference plays a decisive role in wound reepithelialization. For patients with large or chronic wounds, negative&#8208;pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is the most effective clinical method in inflammation control by continuously removing the necrotic tissues or infected substances, thus creating a proproliferative microenvironment beneficial for wound reepithelialization. However, continuous negative&#8208;pressure drainage causes electrolyte loss and weakens the endogenous EF, which in turn hinders wound reepithelialization. Here, an electrogenerative dressing (EGD) is developed by integrating triboelectric nanogenerators with NPWT. By converting the negative&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced mechanical deformation into electricity, EGD produces a stable and high&#8208;safety EF that can trigger a robust epithelial electrotactic response and drive the macrophages toward a reparative M2 phenotype in vitro. Translational medicine studies confirm that EGD completely reshapes the wound EF weakened by NPWT, and promotes wound closure by facilitating an earlier transition of inflammation/proliferation and guiding epithelial migration and proliferation to accelerate reepithelialization. Long&#8208;term EGD therapy remarkably advances tissue remodeling with mature epithelium, orderly extracellular matrix, and less scar formation. Compared with the golden standard of NPWT, EGD orchestrates all the essential wound stages in a noninvasive manner, presenting an excellent prospect in clinical wound therapy.

         <title>Controlled Distributed Ti3C2Tx Hollow Microspheres on Thermally Conductive Polyimide Composite Films for Excellent Electromagnetic Interference Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible (Fe3O4/polyimide (PI))&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres show electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness of 85 dB owing to the magnetic loss in Fe3O4/PI fiber film, multiple reflection, ohmic loss, and polarization loss in Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres.








Abstract
Flexible multifunctional polymer&#8208;based electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding composite films have important applications in the fields of 5G communication technology, wearable electronic devices, and artificial intelligence. Based on the design of a porous/multilayered structure and using polyimide (PI) as the matrix and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres are successfully prepared by sacrificial template method. Owing to the porous/multilayered structure, when the pore size of the Ti3C2Tx hollow microspheres is 10&#160;&#181;m and the mass ratio of PMMA/Ti3C2Tx is 2:1, the (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film has the most excellent EMI shielding performance, with EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 85&#160;dB. It is further verified by finite element simulation that the composite film has an excellent shielding effect on electromagnetic waves. In addition, the composite film has good thermal conductivity (thermal conductivity coefficient of 3.49&#160;W (m&#183;K)&#8722;1) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 65.3&#160;MPa). This flexible (Fe3O4/PI)&#8211;Ti3C2Tx&#8211;(Fe3O4/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high&#8208;power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.

Based on the design of a porous/multilayered structure and using polyimide (PI) as the matrix and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microspheres as the template, flexible (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI)&#8211;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;(Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI) composite films with controllable pore sizes and distribution of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; hollow microspheres are successfully prepared by sacrificial template method. Owing to the porous/multilayered structure, when the pore size of the Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; hollow microspheres is 10&#160;&#181;m and the mass ratio of PMMA/Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is 2:1, the (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI)&#8211;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;(Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI) composite film has the most excellent EMI shielding performance, with EMI shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) of 85&#160;dB. It is further verified by finite element simulation that the composite film has an excellent shielding effect on electromagnetic waves. In addition, the composite film has good thermal conductivity (thermal conductivity coefficient of 3.49&#160;W (m&#183;K)&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and mechanical properties (tensile strength of 65.3&#160;MPa). This flexible (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI)&#8211;Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;(Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/PI) composite film with excellent EMI shielding performance, thermal conductivity, and mechanical properties has demonstrated great potential for applications in EMI shielding protection for high-power, portable, and wearable flexible electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shaping a Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping liquid metals down to the sub&#8208;micrometer scale has enabled a wide range of novel soft and stretchable devices. This review highlights patterning techniques such as injection/vacuum filling, direct ink writing, selective adhesion, and stenciling. Applications are highlighted, followed by a summary of present&#8208;day challenges and opportunities for future development.








Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: 1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. 2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.

         <title>Manipulating Polymer Backbone Configuration via Halogenated Asymmetric End&#8208;Groups Enables Over 18% Efficiency All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two analogous asymmetric polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors of PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T are synthesized based on small&#8208;molecule acceptors with different halogenated end groups to explore their effects on the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). The ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T reaches a high power conversion efficiency of 18.12%, benefitting from the miscibility&#8208;driven optimization of active layer morphology by asymmetric PYFCl&#8208;T.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) deeply rely on the joint contributions of desirable optical absorption, adaptive energy levels, and appropriate morphology. Herein, two structural analogous polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors (PSMAs), PYFCl&#8208;T and PYF&amp;PYCl&#8208;T, are synthesized, and then incorporated into the PM6:PY&#8208;IT binary blends to construct ternary all&#8208;PSCs. Due to the superior compatibility of PY&#8208;IT and PYFCl&#8208;T, the&#160;ternary all&#8208;PSC based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT:PYFCl&#8208;T with 10 wt% PYFCl&#8208;T, presents higher and more balanced charge mobility, suppressed charge recombination, and faster charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, resulting in an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.12% with enhanced Jsc and FF, which is much higher than that (PCE of 16.09%) of the binary all&#8208;PSCs based on PM6:PY&#8208;IT. Besides, the ternary all&#8208;PSCs also exhibit improved photostability. The conspicuous performance enhancement principally should give the credit to the miscibility&#8208;driven phase optimization of the donor and acceptor. These findings highlight the significance of polymer&#8208;backbone configuration modulation of PSMAs in morphology optimization toward boosting the device properties of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>A Tunable Single&#8208;Molecule Light&#8208;Emitting Diode with Single&#8208;Photon Precision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functional electroluminescent molecular bridge is covalently integrated into nanogapped graphene electrodes to build a high&#8208;performance single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode with unprecedented levels of stability and reproducibility. Precise tunability of its emission efficiency, color purity, linear polarization, emitted photon number, and energy is achieved upon application of electric inputs, rational molecular engineering, and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer, affording a new practical single&#8208;photon emitter.








Abstract
A robust single&#8208;molecule light&#8208;emitting diode (SM&#8208;LED) with high color purity, linear polarization, and efficiency tunability is prepared by covalently integrating one fluorescent molecule into nanogapped graphene electrodes. Furthermore, single&#8208;molecule F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the electroluminescent center to different accepters is achieved through rational molecular engineering, enabling construction of a multicolor SM&#8208;LED. All these characterizations are accomplished in the photoelectrical integration system with high temporal/spatial/energy resolution, demonstrating the capability of the single&#8208;photon emission of SM&#8208;LEDs. The success in developing high&#8208;performance SM&#8208;LEDs inspires the development of the next generation of commercial display devices and promises a single&#8208;photon emitter for use in quantum computation and quantum communication.

         <title>Tunable Mesoscopic Collagen Island Architectures Modulate Stem Cell Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A collagen&#8208;I&#8208;based hydrogel system that mimics physiologically relevant tissue architectures is developed, called collagen islands. These island hydrogels are facile to generate by modulating the&#160;shearing frequency and have tunable architectures and mechanical properties. It is found that the&#160;island architecture is able to modulate osteogenic commitment in mesenchymal stem cells and mesodermal differentiation in pluripotent stem cells.








Abstract
The extracellular matrix is the biophysical environment that scaffolds mammalian cells in the body. The main constituent is collagen. In physiological tissues, collagen network topology is diverse with complex mesoscopic features. While studies have explored the roles of collagen density and stiffness, the impact of complex architectures remains not well&#8208;understood. Developing in vitro systems that recapitulate these diverse collagen architectures is critical for understanding physiologically relevant cell behaviors. Here, methods are developed to induce the formation of heterogeneous mesoscopic architectures, referred to as collagen islands, in collagen hydrogels. These island&#8208;containing gels have highly tunable inclusions and mechanical properties. Although these gels are globally soft, there is regional enrichment in the collagen concentration at the cell&#8208;scale. Collagen&#8208;island architectures are utilized to study mesenchymal stem cell behavior, and it is demonstrated that cell migration and osteogenic differentiation are altered. Finally, induced pluripotent stem cells are cultured in island&#8208;containing gels, and it is shown that the architecture is sufficient to induce mesodermal differentiation. Overall, this work highlights complex mesoscopic tissue architectures as bioactive cues in regulating cell behavior and presents a novel collagen&#8208;based hydrogel that captures these features for tissue engineering applications.

         <title>Exciton Manipulation for Enhancing Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Wrinkled 2D Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Local variation of strain in atomically thin wrinkled 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160; generates a laterally varying band structure, which&#160;manipulates the exciton generation and dissociation mechanism and enhances its photoelectrochemical performance with a reduced Tafel value of 49&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 outperforming planar 2D catalysts.








Abstract
2D materials&#8217; junctions have demonstrated capabilities as metal&#8208;free alternatives for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To date, the HER has been limited to heterojunctions of different compositions or band structures.

&lt;p&gt;Local variation of strain in atomically thin wrinkled 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)&#160; generates a laterally varying band structure, which&#160;manipulates the exciton generation and dissociation mechanism and enhances its photoelectrochemical performance with a reduced Tafel value of 49&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; outperforming planar 2D catalysts.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D materials&#8217; junctions have demonstrated capabilities as metal-free alternatives for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To date, the HER has been limited to heterojunctions of different compositions or band structures. Here, the potential of local strain modulation based on wrinkled 2D heterostructures is demonstrated, which&#160;helps&#160;to realize photoelectrocatalytically active junctions. By forming regions of high and low tensile strain in wrinkled WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monolayers, local modification of their band structure and internal electric field due to piezoelectricity is realized in the lateral direction. This structure produces efficient electron&#8211;hole pair generation due to light trapping and exciton funneling toward the crest of the WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; wrinkles and enhances exciton separation. Additionally, the formation of wrinkles induces an air gap in-between the 2D layer and substrate, which reduces the interfacial scattering effect and consequently improves the charge-carrier mobility. A detailed study of the strain-dependence of the photocatalytic HER process demonstrates&#160;a 2-fold decrease in the Tafel slope and a 30-fold enhancement in exchange current density. Finally, optimization of the light absorption through functionalization with quantum dots produces unprecedented photoelectrocatalytic performance and provides a route toward the scalable formation of strain-modulated WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanojunctions for future green energy generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Covalent Organic Frameworks for Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concepts of water harvesting from air are discussed and correlated with the properties required for covalent organic framework (COF) water harvesters. Strategies for designing water harvesting COFs are also summarized.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting using reticular materials is an innovation that has the potential to change the world. Using covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for capturing water holds great promise because COFs are metal&#8208;free, stable under working conditions, and their structure can be intentionally designed to meet the requirements for this application. To promote the chemistry and use of COFs for atmospheric water harvesting, important features for synthesizing suitable water&#8208;harvesting COFs are discussed. The achievements of using COFs as water harvesters are then highlighted, showing how the water harvesting properties are related to the structural design. Finally, perspectives and research directions for further studies in COF chemistry are provided.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Trapping Management in X&#8208;Ray Storage Phosphors for Flexible 3D Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong&#8208;lived X&#8208;ray trapping in CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) is demonstrated for flexible 3D X&#8208;ray imaging. Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution significantly improve their energy&#8208;trapping capability and thermal stability. X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 is further demonstrated, and convenient time&#8208;lapse 3D X&#8208;ray imaging is realized for the curved objects.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray imaging has received sustained attention for healthcare diagnostics and nondestructive inspection. To develop photonic materials with tunable photophysical properties in principle accelerates radiation detection technologies. Here the rational design and synthesis of doped halide perovskite CsCdCl3:Mn2+, R4+ (R = Ti, Zr, Hf, and Sn) are reported as next generation X&#8208;ray storage phosphors, and the capability is greatly improved by trap management via Mn2+ site occupation manipulation and heterovalent substitution. Specially, CsCdCl3:Mn2+, Zr4+ displays zero&#8208;thermal&#8208;quenching (TQ) radioluminescence and anti&#8208;TQ X&#8208;ray&#8208;activated persistent luminescence even up to 448 K, further revealing the charge&#8208;carrier compensation and redeployment mechanisms. X&#8208;ray imaging with the resolution of 12.5 lp mm&#8722;1 is demonstrated, and convenient 3D X&#8208;ray imaging for the curved objects is realized in a time&#8208;lapse manner. This work demonstrates efficient modulation of energy traps to achieve high storage capacities and promote future research into flexible X&#8208;ray detectors.

         <title>Unraveling the Plasma Protein Corona by Ultrasonic Cavitation Augments Active&#8208;Transporting of Liposome in Solid Tumor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A transcytosis&#8208;targeting peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposome (LPGL) is capable of ultrasound&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly and protein&#8208;corona decortication. Ultrasound irradiation induces size&#8208;transformation of the LPGL and decorticates the surface protein corona by lipid membrane reassembly, whereby the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization is regained, ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis is initiated, and efficient tumor accumulation and penetration is achieved, leading to potent antitumor activity.








Abstract
Ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated targeted drug delivery has been widely recognized as a promising strategy for improving the clinical efficacy of&#160;nanomedicines but is attenuated by the binding of plasma protein on the surface of nanoparticles to form a protein corona. Here, it is shown that ultrasonic cavitation can be used to unravel surface plasma coronas on liposomal nanoparticles through ultrasound (US)&#8208;induced liposomal reassembly. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the method, transcytosis&#8208;targeting&#8208;peptide&#8208;decorated reconfigurable liposomes (LPGLs) loaded with gemcitabine (GEM) and perfluoropentane (PFP) are developed for cancer&#8208;targeted therapy. In the blood circulation, the targeting peptides are deactivated by the plasma corona and lose their targeting capability. Once they reach tumor blood vessels, US irradiation induces transformation of the LPGLs from nanodrops into microbubbles via liquid&#8211;gas phase transition and decorticate the surface corona by reassembly of the lipid membrane. The activated liposomes regain the capability to recognize the receptors on tumor neovascularization, initiate ligand/receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis, achieve efficient tumor accumulation and penetration, and lead to potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models of patient&#8208;derived tumor xenografts. This study presents an effective strategy to tackle the fluid biological barriers of the protein corona and develop transcytosis&#8208;targeting liposomes for active tumor transport and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Realizing Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Bactericidal Capability through the Phonon&#8211;Electron Coupling Effect Using Two&#8208;Dimensional Catalytic Planar Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti3C2, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.








Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti3C2&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species (Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)) can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, it is revealed that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2&#160;activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coating with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10&#160;reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

&lt;p&gt;The 2D catalytic planar defects have been rationally designed and engineered for reversing the ultrasonic silence of Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, dramatically realizing the highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal therapy. It is unveiled that the electron's origin, electron transfer, and the visible O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;activation pathway triggered by ultrasound are attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such 0D defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. Herein, 2D catalytic planar defects are designed within Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; species (Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-SD(Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;)) can yield surface-bound O due to the effective activation of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, thus resulting in a substantial amount of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;generation and the 99.72%&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. It is discovered that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene in electron transfer through the phonon drag effect&#8212;a coupling effect between surface electrons and US-triggered phonons&#8212;that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;activation energy from 1.65&#160;to 0.06&#160;eV. This design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D.

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel With Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bioinspired nanoclay&#8208;composite wrinkled hydrogel sensor is developed with excellent mechanical and biocompatible properties and high and reliable sensing capacity due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the wrinkle micropattern and nanoclay&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating crosslinked network. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs, showing promise for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological heart tissue.








Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8211;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggering inflammatory stress response after in vivo implantation. Herein, a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel is reported. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibits excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8211;mechanical&#8211;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation, improving its biosafety as an implanted device, and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, this hydrogel sensor is demonstrated to be able to&#160;accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>Synergistic Surface Modification of Tin&#8211;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic surface modification of mixed Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite films by the combination of piperazine and C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid realizes narrow&#8208;bandgap solar cells with power conversion efficiencies up to 22.7% and substantially elongated stability.








Abstract
Interfaces in thin&#8208;film photovoltaics play a pivotal role in determining device efficiency and longevity. In this work, the top surface treatment of mixed tin&#8211;lead (&#8776;1.26&#160;eV) halide perovskite films for p&#8211;i&#8211;n solar cells is studied. Charge extraction is promoted by treating the perovskite surface with piperazine. This compound reacts with the organic cations at the perovskite surface, modifying the surface structure and tuning the interfacial energy level alignment. In addition, the combined treatment with C60 pyrrolidine tris&#8208;acid (CPTA) reduces hysteresis and leads to efficiencies up to 22.7%, with open&#8208;circuit voltage values reaching 0.90&#160;V, &#8776;92% of the radiative limit for the bandgap of this material. The modified cells also show superior stability, with unencapsulated cells retaining 96% of their initial efficiency after &gt;2000 h of storage in N2 and encapsulated cells retaining 90% efficiency after &gt;450 h of storage in air. Intriguingly, CPTA preferentially binds to Sn2+ sites at film surface over Pb2+ due to the energetically favored exposure of the former, according to first&#8208;principles calculations. This work provides new insights into the surface chemistry of perovskite films in terms of their structural, electronic, and defect characteristics and this knowledge is used to fabricate state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor Gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor is presented using spatially uniform voltage&#8208;controlled magnetic anisotropy. A gate operation can control the translational motion of a magnetic skyrmion. Utilizing the gate&#8208;controlled skyrmion motion technique, the authors expect various skyrmion logic devices to be demonstrated in the future.








Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally, is introduced. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area can be maintained. The findings will open a new route toward the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By synthesizing a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF and combining a ternary blending strategy, favorable phase separation morphology featuring more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance can be attained. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 18.2% (certified value of 17.7%) with excellent mechanical properties in all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells is demonstrated.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) is introduced to enable highly efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;) is introduced to enable highly efficient all-polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high-&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; PBDB-TF as a third component into the PBQx-TF:PY-IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all-polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. These results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all-polymer OPV cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;Dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly luminescent zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic antimony bromide hybrid containing semiconducting organic cation is developed for the first time, with which electrically driven red light emitting diodes (LEDs) are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2 cd A&#8722;1.








Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) are routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide bandgap organic cations. Here, the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;), is reported. By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation is developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs are fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Construction of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Films via Crosslinking&#8208;Induced Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small clusters in the early growth steps of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors (denoted as preMOFs) with good processibility. Then, the removal of solvents and modulators will trigger the crosslinking of preMOFs and lead to the formation of continuous MOF films.








Abstract
The construction of metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films is a crucial step for integrating them into technical applications. However, due to the crystallization nature, it is difficult to grow most MOFs spontaneously or process them into films. Here, a convenient strategy is demonstrated for constructing MOF films by using modulators to achieve homogeneous assembly of MOF clusters. Small clusters in the early growth steps of MOFs can be stabilized by modulators to form fluidic precursors with good processibility. Then, simple removal of modulators will trigger the crosslinking of MOF clusters and lead to the formation of continuous films. This strategy is universal for the fabrication of several types of MOF films with large scale and controllable thickness, which can be deposited on a variety of substrates as well as can be patterned in micro/nano resolution. Additionally, versatile composite MOF films can be easily synthesized by introducing functional materials during the crosslinking process, which brings them broader application prospects.

         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High&#8208;Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale combinatorial libraries are introduced as a new method for exploration of polyelemental material systems. Composition gradients of quinary material systems are produced and characterized for crystal properties and electrocatalytic activity. The small dimensions of microscale combinatorial libraries enable efficient screening of thousands of compositions. Highly active electrocatalysts are identified in the systems Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt and Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt.








Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high&#8208;entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. This challenge is addressed by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin&#8208;film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high&#8208;entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high&#8208;entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. Activity optima in the system Ru&#8211;Rh&#8211;Pd&#8211;Ir&#8211;Pt are identified, and active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8211;Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;Pd&#8211;Pt are discovered. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly spectrally reproducible multimode random lasing is observed in thin polycrystalline films of tin iodide perovskite that cannot be explained by a strong mode localization. The observed spectral reproducibility can be due to the strong inhomogeneous broadening of photoluminescence spectra measured in tin&#8208;based perovskites on the basis of a comparison with an analogous Pb&#8208;based counterpart.








Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of formamidinium tin triiodide perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2&#160;&#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 (both at 20&#160;K) are achieved. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, it is suggested that the spectral stability is a result of such an unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organohydrogel Artificial Muscle with Compartmentalized Anisotropic Actuation Under Microdomain Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organohydrogel actuator achieving the combination of high speed, high actuation strength, and large material size is proposed. The water is confined in hydrophobic microdomains in organohydrogel, thus realizing a compartmentalization actuation mode similar to muscle. This strategy can break through the limitations that originated from the traditional solvent diffusion actuation mechanism, inspiring gel actuator design.








Abstract
Current hydrogel actuators mostly suffer from weak actuation strength and low responsive speed owing to their solvent diffusion&#8208;induced volume change mechanism. Here a skeletal muscle&#8208;inspired organohydrogel actuator is reported in which solvents are confined in hydrophobic microdomains. Organohydrogel actuator is driven by compartmentalized directional network deformation instead of volume change, avoiding the limitations that originate from solvent diffusion. Organohydrogel actuator has an actuation frequency of 0.11&#160;Hz, 110 times that of traditional solvent diffusion&#8208;driven hydrogel actuators (&lt;10&#8722;3&#160;Hz), and can lift more than 85 times their own weight. This design achieves the combination of high responsive speed, high actuation strength, and large material size, proposing a strategy to fabricate hydrogel actuators comparable with skeletal muscle performance.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;Induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A goal in graphene synthesis is to establish routes for preparing graphene materials from liquids instead of conventional solid or gaseous sources. This work reports the production of graphene materials with tunable composition directly from liquid precursor. A fundamentally new graphene 3D&#8208;printing system is further developed for constructing 3D graphene materials with high structural integrity unachievable by traditional printing strategy.








Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8776;15 wt.%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S&#160;m&#8722;1 and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

         <title>Bioengineering of High Cell Density Tissues with Hierarchical Vascular Networks for Ex Vivo Whole Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method is shown to fabricate an in vitro model of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues. The supply of oxygen and nutrition is extremely significant for such tissues. Therefore, a hierarchical vascular network containing capillaries and an artificial channel for perfusion are formed.








Abstract
The development of tissue&#8208;like structures such as cell sheets, spheroids, and organoids has contributed to progress in regenerative medicine. Simultaneous achievement of scale up and high cell density of these tissues is challenging because sufficient oxygen cannot be supplied to the inside of large, high cell density tissues. Here, in vitro fabrication of vessels to supply oxygen to the inside of millimeter&#8208;sized scaffold&#8208;free tissues whose cell density is &#8776;200 million cells mL&#8722;1, corresponding to those of native tissues, is shown. Hierarchical vascular networks by anastomosis of capillaries and a large vessel are essential for oxygen supply, whereas a large vessel or capillary networks alone make negligible contributions to the supply. The hierarchical vascular networks are formed by a top&#8208;down approach, which offers a new option for ex vivo whole organs without decellularization and 3D&#8208;bioprinting.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>

A simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine is developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology.

Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA&#8208;based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state-of-the-art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA and high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, a simple small molecule 10-(4-(3,6-dimethoxy-9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)-3,7-bis(4-vinylphenyl)-10H-phenoxazine (MCz-VPOZ) is strategically developed for in situ fabrication of polymer hole conductor (CL-MCz) via a facile and low-temperature cross-linking technology. The resulting polymer CL-MCz offers high energy ordering and improved electrical conductivity, as well as appropriate energy-level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL-MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high-quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL-MCz yields a champion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41 eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non-PTAA-based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibit competitive shelf-life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 h, reflecting high promises of CL-MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross-linking approach in preparing low-cost, stable, and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A New Class of Cluster&#8211;Matrix Nanocomposite Made of Fully Miscible Components</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The prospect for creating highly metastable nanocomposite materials made from fully miscible alloy systems, like Ni&#8211;Cu, is opened. The cluster ion beam deposition technique allows stabilization of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters in a Cu&#8208;matrix with varying macroscopic concentration. Consequently, unique magnetic and magnetotransport properties are evident as a function of cluster concentration and enthalpy&#8208;driven cluster dissolution.








Abstract
Nanocomposite materials, consisting of two or more phases, at least one of which has a nanoscale dimension, play a distinctive role in materials science because of the multiple possibilities for tailoring their structural properties and, consequently, their functionalities. In addition to the challenges of controlling the size, size distribution, and volume fraction of nanometer phases, thermodynamic stability conditions limit the choice of constituent materials. This study goes beyond this limitation by showing the possibility of achieving nanocomposites from a bimetallic system, which exhibits complete miscibility under equilibrium conditions. A series of nanocomposite samples with different compositions are synthesized by the co&#8208;deposition of 2000&#8208;atom Ni&#8208;clusters and a flux of Cu&#8208;atoms using a novel cluster ion beam deposition system. The retention of the metastable nanostructure is ascertained from atom probe tomography (APT), magnetometry, and magnetotransport studies. APT confirms the presence of nanoscale regions with &#8776;100 at% Ni. Magnetometry and magnetotransport studies reveal superparamagnetic behavior and magnetoresistance stemming from the single&#8208;domain ferromagnetic Ni&#8208;clusters embedded in the Cu&#8208;matrix. Essentially, the magnetic properties of the nanocomposites can be tailored by the precise control of the Ni concentration. The initial results offer a promising direction for future research on nanocomposites consisting of fully miscible elements.

         <title>Efficient Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells on Industrially Compatible Textured Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is reported to modify the crystallization process of perovskite films on industrially feasible double&#8208;side textured silicon, which enables conformal deposition with improved film crystallinity and reduced trap density. This allows the fabrication of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 28.9% (certified efficiency of 27.9%) and 25.1% for areas of 1 and 16&#160;cm2, respectively.








Abstract
Monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells promise power&#8208;conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit of single&#8208;junction solar cells. The conformal deposition of perovskites on industrially feasible textured silicon solar cells allows for both lowered manufacturing costs and a higher matched photocurrent density, compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandems using front&#8208;side flat or mildly textured silicon. However, the inferior crystal quality of perovskite films grown on fully&#8208;textured silicon compromises the photovoltaic performance. Here, an anion&#8208;engineered additive strategy is developed to control the crystallization process of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films, which enables improved film crystallinity, reduced trap density, and conformal deposition on industrially textured silicon. This strategy allows the fabrication of 28.6%&#8208;efficient perovskite/silicon heterojunction tandem solar cells (certified 27.9%, 1&#160;cm2). This approach is compatible with the scalable fabrication of tandems on industrially textured silicon, demonstrating an efficiency of 25.1% for an aperture area of 16&#160;cm2. The anion&#8208;engineered additive significantly improves the operating stability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells, and the encapsulated tandem solar cells retain over 80% of their initial performance following 2000&#160;h of operation under full 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient conditions.

         <title>Observation of Multi&#8208;Directional Energy Transfer in a Hybrid Plasmonic&#8211;Excitonic Nanostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast charge and energy exchange across the interface of a hybrid plasmonic heterostructure are explored with momentum resolved electron spectroscopy and diffraction. The results identify a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal, driven by a non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction. Non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination, electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy backflow.








Abstract
Hybrid plasmonic devices involve a nanostructured metal supporting localized surface plasmons to amplify light&#8211;matter interaction, and a non&#8208;plasmonic material to functionalize charge excitations. Application&#8208;relevant epitaxial heterostructures, however, give rise to ballistic ultrafast dynamics that challenge the conventional semiclassical understanding of unidirectional nanometal&#8208;to&#8208;substrate energy transfer. Epitaxial Au nanoislands are studied on WSe2 with time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and femtosecond electron diffraction: this combination of techniques resolves material, energy, and momentum of charge&#8208;carriers and phonons excited in the heterostructure. A strong non&#8208;linear plasmon&#8211;exciton interaction that transfers the energy of sub&#8208;bandgap photons very efficiently to the semiconductor is observed, leaving the metal cold until non&#8208;radiative exciton recombination heats the nanoparticles on hundreds of femtoseconds timescales. The results resolve a multi&#8208;directional energy exchange on timescales shorter than the electronic thermalization of the nanometal. Electron&#8211;phonon coupling and diffusive charge&#8208;transfer determine the subsequent energy flow. This complex dynamics opens perspectives for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications, while providing a constraining experimental testbed for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art&#160;modelling.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two disparate polymer networks are created simultaneously using non&#8208;interacting chemical reactions and light as a stimulus. Upon turning the light on, the polymers want to phase&#8208;separate like oil and water, but the process is hindered as they interlock. Thus, the degree and location of phase separation, and in&#8208;turn mechanical properties, can be precisely controlled by the &#8220;flick of a switch&#8221;.








Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8776;1&#8211;2 min) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5&#160;min), which is supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8776;1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#181;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. As a final demonstration, the fabrication of hinges represents a possible use case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <dc:description>
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed for in situ labeling of corona proteins. Nano&#8208;PPL exhibits a significantly improved temporal resolution (5 s duration) and reveals precise dynamics of protein coronas on anionic and cationic nanoparticles. This technology represents a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions.








Abstract
Protein corona broadly affects the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo. Although it has been widely studied by multiple strategies like centrifugal sedimentation, the rapidly forming mechanism and the dynamic structure of the protein corona at the seconds level remains challenging. Here, a photocatalytic proximity labeling technology in nanoparticles (nano&#8208;PPL) is developed. By fabricating a &#8220;core&#8208;shell&#8221; nanoparticle co&#8208;loaded with chlorin e6 catalyst and biotin&#8208;phenol probe, nano&#8208;PPL technology is validated for the rapid and precise labeling of corona proteins in situ. Nano&#8208;PPL significantly improves the temporal resolution of nano&#8208;protein interactions to 5 s duration compared with the classical centrifugation method (&gt;30 s duration). Furthermore, nano&#8208;PPL achieves the fast and dynamic mapping of the protein corona on anionic and cationic nanoparticles, respectively. Finally, nano&#8208;PPL is deployed to verify the effect of the rapidly formed protein corona on the initial interaction of nanoparticles with cells. These findings highlight a significant methodological advance toward nano&#8208;protein interactions in the delivery of nanomedicines in vivo.

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Co&#8208;therapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) is developed. The endogenic H2&#8208;triggered &#8220;domino effect&#8221; in tumor tissue is clearly revealed. The developed H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy guided by US imaging in vivo will open up a feasible new way for green, economic, and effective treatment of cancer in the future.








Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites is reported to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80&#160;mm3) within 1&#160;day. Adequate H2 is controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME by using clinical acupuncture Fe needles as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage/destruction of vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in situ can elevate the tumor's internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy the tumor&#160;under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME is disturbed as H2 also participates in the physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the body's inflammatory response to cancer is reduced after the treatment, which is beneficial for the body's immune system during post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all of these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD co&#8208;therapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Bandgap Reduction of GaN&#8211;ZnO Solid&#8208;Solution Thin Films Fabricated by Nanolamination of Atomic Layer Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition is employed to fabricate (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x homogenous solid&#8208;solution films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 by varying the cycle ratios. The density functional theory calculations using a superlattice model are performed to evaluate and validate the reduction of bandgaps that results in enhanced visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
Nanolamination of GaN and ZnO layers by atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to fabricate GaN&#8211;ZnO homogenous solid&#8208;solution thin films because it offers more precise control of the stoichiometry. By varying the ALD cycle ratios of GaN:ZnO from 5:10 to 10:5, the (GaN)1&#8722;x(ZnO)x films with 0.39 &#8806; x &#8806; 0.79 are obtained. The formation of solid solution is explained based on the atomic stacking and preferred orientation of the layers of GaN and ZnO. However, the growth rates of GaN and ZnO during the lamination process are different from those of pure GaN and ZnO films. It is found that GaN grows faster on ZnO, whereas ZnO grows slower on GaN. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed using a superlattice model for GaN and ZnO laminated layers fabricated by ALD to understand the difference of density of states (DOS) and evaluate the bandgaps for various atomic configurations in the solid&#8208;solution films. The band positions are experimentally defined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Significant bandgap reduction of the solid solutions is observed, which can be explained by the DOS from the DFT calculations. Visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is conducted to confirm the applicability of the solid&#8208;solution films.

         <title>Fullerene&#8208;Liquid&#8208;Crystal&#8208;Induced Micrometer&#8208;Scale Charge&#8208;Carrier Diffusion in Organic Bulk Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mobility fullerene liquid crystal is introduced into the active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) to provide a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport, reduce energetic disorder and trap density via enhancing crystallization, and then realize micrometer&#8208;scale charge&#8208;carrier diffusion, leading to the impressive power conversion efficiencies of 15.23% for OSCs with the thickness approaching 500 nm.








Abstract
The short charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length (LD) (100&#8211;300&#160;nm) in organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) impedes the further improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially for thick&#8208;film (&gt;400&#160;nm) devices matching with industrial solution processing. Here a facile method is developed to efficiently increase LD and then improve PCEs of OSCs via introducing a fullerene liquid crystal, F1, into the active layer. F1 combines the inherent high electron mobility of fullerene and strong self&#8208;assembly capacity of liquid crystal, providing a fast channel for charge&#8208;carrier transport&#160;and reducing energetic disorder and trap density in BHJ film via enhancing crystallization. Typically, in PM6:Y6:F1 BHJ, the enhanced charge&#8208;carrier mobility (&gt;10&#8722;2 cm&#8722;2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (55.3 &#181;s) are acquired to realize the record LD of 1.6 or 2.4&#160;&#181;m for electron or hole, respectively, which are much higher than those of the PM6:Y6 binary sample and comparable to or even better than those values reported for some inorganic/hybrid materials, such as CuInxGa(1&#8722;x)Se2 (CIGS) and perovskite thin films. Benefitting from the micrometer&#8208;scale LD, the PM6:Y6:F1 ternary OSCs sustain a remarkable PCE of 15.23% with the active layer thickness approaching 500&#160;nm.

         <title>Electron Conductive and Transparent Hydrogels for Recording Brain Neural Signals and Neuromodulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is proposed to break the current bottleneck of implantable materials, which demonstrate a suit of desirable performances including matched modulus, good transparency, and high conductivity. The hydrogel electrode is successfully utilized for optogenetic neuromodulation and simultaneously recording the brain's neural signals, establishing the correlation between brain neural signals and corresponding limb behavior.








Abstract
Recording brain neural signals and optogenetic neuromodulations open&#160;frontiers in decoding brain neural information and neurodegenerative disease therapeutics. Conventional implantable probes suffer from modulus mismatch with biological tissues and an irreconcilable tradeoff between transparency and electron conductivity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to address these tradeoffs, which generates conductive and transparent hydrogels with polypyrrole&#8208;decorated microgels as cross&#8208;linkers. The optical transparency of the electrodes can be attributed to the special structures that allow light waves to bypass the microgel particles and minimize their interaction. Demonstrated by probing the hippocampus of rat brains, the biomimetic electrode shows a prolonged capacity for simultaneous optogenetic neuromodulation and recording of brain neural signals. More importantly, an intriguing brain&#8211;machine interaction is realized, which involves signal input to the brain, brain neural signal generation, and controlling limb behaviors. This breakthrough work represents a significant scientific advancement toward decoding brain neural information and developing neurodegenerative disease therapies.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode Enables Exceptional Cyclability in Pouch&#8208;Type Full Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode, which consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with rich oxygen stable {001} planes. The resultant cathode effectively homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain and greatly inhibits the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen loss during de&#8208;/lilthiation, leading to superior electrochemical performances at various rates and operating temperatures.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li/Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5 C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptionally long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1 C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5 C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8211;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater to the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>Transparent Porous Conductive Substrates for Gas&#8208;Phase Photoelectrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent gas diffusion electrodes are developed via the F&#8208;doped SnO2 coating of SiO2 fused fiber felts. These highly porous and conductive substrates are amenable to the disposition of various semiconductors and are employed herein to demonstrate photoelectrode membrane assemblies for solar&#8208;driven H2 production in a gas&#8208;phase flow cell.








Abstract
Gas diffusion electrodes are essential components of common fuel and electrolysis cells but are typically made from graphitic carbon or metallic materials, which do not allow light transmittance and thus limit the development of gas&#8208;phase based photoelectrochemical devices. Herein, the simple and scalable preparation of F&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) coated SiO2 interconnected fiber felt substrates is reported. Using 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m diameter fibers at a loading of 4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the resulting substrates have porosity of 90%, roughness factor of 15.8, and Young's Modulus of 0.2&#160;GPa. A 100 nm conformal coating of FTO via atmospheric chemical vapor deposition gives sheet resistivity of 20 &#177; 3 &#937; sq&#8722;1 and loss of incident light of 41% at illumination wavelength of 550&#160;nm. The coating of various semiconductors on the substrates is established including Fe2O3 (chemical bath deposition), CuSCN and Cu2O (electrodeposition), and conjugated polymers (dip coating), and liquid&#8208;phase photoelectrochemical performance commensurate with flat FTO substrates is confirmed. Finally, gas phase H2 production is demonstrated with a polymer semiconductor photocathode membrane assembly at 1&#8208;Sun photocurrent density on the order of 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 40%.

         <title>Dual Topology of Dirac Electron Transport and Photogalvanic Effect in Low&#8208;Dimensional Topological Insulator Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacking layer number&#8208;dependent electron structure, quantum properties, and circularly (linearly) polarized photogalvanic effect are assessed in the low&#8208;dimensional dual topological superlattices (TSLs) (Bi2Se3)&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.








Abstract
Dual topological insulators, simultaneously protected by time&#8208;reversal symmetry and crystalline symmetry, open great opportunities to explore different symmetry&#8208;protected metallic surface states. However, the conventional dual topological states located on different facets hinder integration into planar opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic devices. Here, dual topological superlattices (TSLs) Bi2Se3&#8208;(Bi2/Bi2Se3)N with limited stacking layer number N are constructed. Angle&#8208;resolved photoelectron emission spectra of the TSLs identify the coexistence and adjustment of dual topological surface states on Bi2Se3 facet. The existence and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized dual&#8208;topological bands with N on Bi2Se3 facet result in an unconventionally weak antilocalization effect (WAL) with variable WAL coefficient &#945; (maximum close to 3/2) from quantum transport experiments. Most importantly, it is identified that the spin&#8208;polarized surface electrons from dual topological bands exhibit circularly and linearly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE and LPGE). It is anticipated that the stacked dual&#8208;topology and stacking layer number controlled bands evolution provide a platform for realizing intrinsic CPGE and LPGE. The results show that the surface electronic structure of the dual TSLs is highly tunable and well&#8208;regulated for quantum transport and photoexcitation, which shed light on engineering for opto&#8208;electronic/spintronic applications.

         <title>Ferroelectric Domain Control of Nonlinear Light Polarization in MoS2 via PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 Thin Films and Free&#8208;Standing Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferroelectric domain patterning enabled approach is developed to achieve nanoscale reconfigurable modulation of the amplitude and polarization of SHG light in MoS2 interfaced with PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films and membranes. The light polarization exhibits threefold symmetry at polar domains and twofold symmetry at domain walls. This study opens up new opportunities for developing smart nano&#8208;photonics and optical computing systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoS2 exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinear optical responses, while nanoscale control of the amplitude, polar orientation, and phase of the nonlinear light in TMDCs remains challenging. In this work, by interfacing monolayer MoS2 with epitaxial PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films and free&#8208;standing PZT membranes, the amplitude and polarization of the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal are modulated via ferroelectric domain patterning, which demonstrates that PZT membranes can lead to in&#8208;operando programming of nonlinear light polarization. The interfacial coupling of the MoS2 polar axis with either the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polar domains of PZT or the in&#8208;plane polarization of domain walls tailors the SHG light polarization into different patterns with distinct symmetries, which are modeled via nonlinear electromagnetic theory. This study provides a new material platform that enables reconfigurable design of light polarization at the nanoscale, paving the path for developing novel optical information processing, smart light modulators, and integrated photonic circuits.

         <title>Fast and Durable Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction at the Electron&#8208;Deficient Ruthenium&#8211;Ruthenium Oxide Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure is designed as an efficient electrocatalyst toward the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). The interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively. The Ru domains are electron deficient and show substantially improved inoxidizability. The results highlight the significance of establishing robust and multifunctional heterointerfaces toward fast alkaline HOR and beyond.








Abstract
The slow hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) kinetics under alkaline conditions remain a critical challenge for the practical application of alkaline exchange membrane fuel cells. Herein, Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructures are designed with abundant active Ru&#8211;RuO2 interface domains as efficient electrocatalysts for the HOR in alkaline media. The experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that interfacial Ru and RuO2 domains at Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces are the optimal H and OH adsorption sites, respectively, endowing the well&#8208;defined Ru(100)/RuO2(200) interface as the preferential region for fast alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. More importantly, the metallic Ru domains become electron deficient due to the strong interaction with RuO2 domains and show substantially improved inoxidizability, which is vital to maintain durable HOR electrocatalytic activity. The optimal Ru/RuO2 heterostructured electrocatalyst exhibits impressive alkaline HOR activity with an exchange current density of 8.86&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and decent durability. The exceptional electrocatalytic performance of Ru/RuO2 in&#8208;plane heterostructure can be attributed to the robust and multifunctional Ru&#8211;RuO2 interfaces endowed by the unique metal&#8211;metal oxide domains.

         <title>Weakening Li+ De&#8208;solvation Barrier for Cryogenic Li&#8211;S Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antecedent theoretical simulations decipher the correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ desolvation barrier in the electrolyte, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance kinetics of sulfur cathode effectively. This insight endows Li&#8211;S pouch cells with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350 Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0 &#176;C, demonstrating great&#160;potential for&#160;cryogenic&#160;Li&#8211;S&#160;batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8211;S batteries hold promise for pushing cell&#8208;level energy densities beyond 300&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 while operating at low temperatures (LTs, below 0&#160;&#176;C). However, the capacity release of existing Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs is still barely satisfactory, and there is almost no verification of the practicability of Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs in the Ah&#8208;level pouch cell. Here, antecedent molecular dynamics (MDs) combined with density functional theory analysis are used to systematically investigate Li+ solvation structure in conventional Li&#8211;S batteries at LTs, which unprecedentedly reveals the positive correlation between lithium salt concentration and Li+ de&#8208;solvation barrier, indicating dilute electrolytes can enhance the Li+ de&#8208;solvation kinetics and thus improve the capacity performance of cryogenic Li&#8211;S batteries. These insights derived from theoretical simulations invested Li&#8211;S batteries with a 67.34% capacity retention at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared to their room temperature performance. In particular, an Ah&#8208;level Li&#8211;S pouch cell using dilute electrolytes with a high sulfur loading (5.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte condition is fabricated, which delivers a discharge capacity of about 1000 mAh g&#8208;1 and ultra&#8208;high energy density of 350&#160;Wh kg&#8208;1 at 0&#160;&#176;C, offering a promising route toward a practical high&#8208;energy cryogenic Li&#8211;S battery.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative 3D cold trap environment printing technology (3DCEP) is proposed in this work to fabricate a MXene/Zn&#8208;P aerogel anode with highly aligned arrangement. Benefitting from unique high lattice matching and physical confinement effects inside the electrode, it can effectively inhibit the Zn dendrite growth and Zn&#8208;P corrosion in electrolytes. Finally, a 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full cell with long cyclic life can be realized.








Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion batteries owing to their low cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within the&#160;3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating&#8211;stripping. Consequently, the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776;9.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1600 cycles. This study brings an inspired universal pathway to rapidly fabricate a reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in a cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Many&#8208;Body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Many&#8208;body interactions in exciton complexes are crucial in many devices, for example, lasers, LEDs, and quantum light sources. Here, a combination of single quantum&#8208;dot photoluminescence spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures and configuration&#8208;interaction calculations reveals the size&#8208;dependent binding energies of trions (7&#8211;17&#160;meV) and biexcitons (15&#8211;30&#160;meV) in CsPbBr3&#160;quantum dots.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (LHP) (CsPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8211;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8211;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, for example, by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies are addressed. Trion binding energies increase from 7&#160;to 17&#160;meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15&#160;to 30&#160;meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. The findings here provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic LHP QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single&#8208;Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to create a single&#8208;atom Fe catalyst on a mesoporous NC material by engineering the electronic structures of the metal sites is reported. This catalyst achieves remarkable electrocatalytic activity in the oxygen reduction reaction&#160;and oxygen evolution reaction, and demonstrates great potential in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the optimized electronic structure of Fe1N4O1 moieties contributes to excellent electrocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed if the performance of these catalysts is to be enhanced. Herein, a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprising atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8211;support interactions is developed. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of the metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieves remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93, 0.83, and 0.75&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrates a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibits superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Initiating Reversible Aqueous Copper&#8211;Tellurium Conversion Reaction with High Volumetric Capacity through Electrolyte Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The copper&#8211;tellurium conversion reaction with high volumetric capacity of 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3 and long discharge plateau are investigated. The thermodynamic&#8211;kinetic asymmetries of the Cu&#8211;Te multiphase&#8208;conversion and oxidation&#8208;failure mechanisms are systematically revealed. The developed precise electrolyte engineering overcomes inherent oxidative distress and extends the cycling life of the battery by about three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Pursuing conversion&#8208;type cathodes with high volumetric capacity that can be used in aqueous environments remains rewarding and challenging. Tellurium (Te) is a promising alternative electrode due to its intrinsic attractive electronic conductivity and high theoretical volumetric capacity yet still to be explored. Herein, the kinetically/thermodynamically co&#8208;dominat copper&#8211;tellurium (Cu&#8211;Te) alloying phase&#8208;conversion process and corresponding oxidation failure mechanism of tellurium are investigated using in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction and comprehensive ex situ characterization techniques. By virtue of the fundamental insights into the tellurium electrode, facile and precise electrolyte engineering (solvated structure modulation or reductive antioxidant addition) is implemented to essentially tackle the dramatic capacity loss in tellurium, affording reversible aqueous Cu&#8211;Te conversion reaction with an unprecedented ultrahigh volumetric capacity of up to 3927&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;3, a flat long discharge plateau (capacity proportion of &#8776;81%), and an extraordinary level of capacity retention of 80.4% over 2000 cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 of which lifespan thousand&#8208;fold longer than Cu&#8211;Te conversion using CuSO4&#8211;H2O electrolyte. This work paves a significant avenue for expanding high&#8208;performance conversion&#8208;type cathodes toward energetic aqueous multivalent&#8208;ion batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;function colloidal quantum dot (QD) devices that operate as a high&#8208;current density light emitting diode and an optically excited laser are demonstrated. The device structure has been optimized to reduce optical losses and allow for efficient wave&#8208;guiding within the active QD layer. This demonstration represents an important milestone toward the practical implementation of a colloidal QD laser diode.








Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials can benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunications, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by rapid nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation at high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here&#160;we&#160;resolve some of these challenges and demonstrate optically excited lasing from fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams through Template&#8208;Coating Pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>

The manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon materials on a macroscopic length scale has a significant impact on the construction, packaging, and transportation industries. Presented herein is a tunable platform for macroscale fabrication of lightweight and strong pyrolytic carbon foams through template&#8208;coating pair design.








Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density and small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables structural inheritance, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8776;80% dimension retention; &#8776;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8776;0.13&#160;GPa g&#8722;1 cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Well&#8208;Defined Fullerene Bisadducts Enable High&#8208;Performance Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four fullerene bisadduct regioisomers on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Benefiting from the favorable molecular packing, energy level alignment, and interfacial interaction, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based devices yield a champion efficiency of 14.58% with a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) are attracting intense research interest due to their excellent optoelectric properties and eco&#8208;friendly features. To further improve the device performance, developing new fullerene derivatives as electron transporter layers (ETLs) is highly demanded. Four well&#8208;defined regioisomers (trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e) of diethylmalonate&#8208;C60 bisadduct (DCBA) are isolated and well characterized. The well&#8208;defined molecular structure enables us to investigate the real structure&#8208;dependent effects on photovoltaic performance. It is found that the chemical structures of the regioisomers not only affect their energy levels, but also lead to significant differences in their molecular packings and interfacial contacts. As a result, the devices with trans&#8208;2, trans&#8208;3, trans&#8208;4, and e as ETLs yield efficiencies of 11.69%, 14.58%, 12.59%, and 10.55%, respectively, which are higher than that of the as&#8208;prepared DCBA&#8208;based (10.28%) device. Notably, the trans&#8208;3&#8208;based device also demonstrates a certified efficiency of 14.30%, representing one of the best&#8208;performing TPSCs.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlling and tuning the orbital ordering in a single molecule using a monolayer ferroelectric substrate is realized. This is achieved by adsorbing transition metal phthalocyanine (TMPc) molecules on a ferroelectric monolayer SnTe. The orbital order is probed using low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments, and it is demonstrated that it can be controllably changed by switching the polarization direction of the underlying ferroelectric monolayer.








Abstract
2D ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe are reported. The strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe are found to create a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), it is successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. The results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows for control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the drawbacks of current nanozyme catalytic therapy, a novel Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom/Cer nanoagent with asymmetric electron distribution is developed, which can improve the efficiency of multienzyme&#8208;catalyzed cascade reactions through a substrate&#8208;recyclable manner, thereby disrupting the intracellular redox and energy metabolism homeostasis to achieve efficient tumor therapy.








Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, a novel and efficient Ir&#63743;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#63743;N5 SA) nanozyme is developed with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single&#8208;atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#63743;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#63743;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can generate a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can also generate O2 and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#63743;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, the designed Ir&#63743;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupt redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through an enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascade reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Monolithic Tandem Vertical Electrochemical Transistors for Printed Multi&#8208;Valued Logic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new design of high&#8208;speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical&#8208;tuning of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox&#8208;based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high&#8208;functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi&#8208;valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual&#8208;channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual&#8208;ion&#8208;penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very&#8208;high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz.

&lt;p&gt;A new design of high-speed electrochemical ternary logic transistor is presented. A vertically stacked dual channel heterostructure enables a clear manifestation of multiple logic states in 1&#160;V input&#8211;output voltage ranges, through a simple chemical-tuning of semiconductor materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have recently emerged as a feasible candidate to realize the next generation of printable electronics. Especially, their chemical versatility and the unique redox-based operating principle have provided new possibilities in high-functioning logic circuitry beyond the traditional binary Boolean logic. Here, a simple strategy to electrochemically realize monolithic multi-valued logic transistors is presented, which is one of the most promising branches of transistor technology in the forthcoming era of hyper Moore's law. A vertically stacked heterogeneous dual-channel architecture is introduced with a patterned reference electrode, which enables a facile manifestation of stable and equiprobable ternary logic states with a reduced transistor footprint. The dual-ion-penetration mechanism coupled with ultrashort vertical channel even allows a very-high accessing frequency to multiple logic states reaching over 10&#160;MHz. Furthermore, printed arrays of ternary logic gates with full voltage swing within 1&#160;V are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy is reported to construct dendrite&#8208;free metal anodes with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates, which epitaxially match the closest packed facets of metals. The closest packed facets of metal anodes aligned horizontally with substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability. Consequently, the metal anodes display high reversibility and outstanding performance.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al, and Fe, taking advantage of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concerns when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here it is reported that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, and Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hexagonal close&#8208;packed, face&#8208;centered cubic, and body&#8208;centered cubic) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show a cycling life span of over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;&#160;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid Cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals for Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel post&#8208;synthesis cesium/formamidinium (Cs/FA) mixed&#8208;cation perovskite nanocrystals possess high structural and optoelectronic properties for integration in self&#8208;healing polymer composites. Entropic&#8208;driven self&#8208;healing not only enhances white backlight display performance, but also sustains the working performance of a shattered&#8211;repaired glass substrate laser, thereby representing potentially major advances in optoelectronics and photonics applications.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical bandgap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation&#160;displays. Herein, a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity cesium/formamidinium lead bromide HPNCs(Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3) is presented. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4 h autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed lead leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8211;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold values of 1.24 and 8.58 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

Organic Metal Halide Hybrids
Efficient electroluminescent devices can now be fabricated using solution&#8208;processed thin films based on 0D organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs). In article number 2209417, Biwu Ma and co&#8208;workers develop a highly luminescent 0D OMHH containing organic semiconducting cations, which successfully addresses the issues of low conductivity and poor energy alignment of existing 0D OMHHs for electrically driven light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 9, March 2, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry&#8208;relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.








Abstract
Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&gt;108&#160;devices mm&#8722;2) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three&#8208;dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase&#8208;change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit and procedures to implement LM&#8208;based RS devices are defined. LM&#8208;based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m2) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions.

     alt="Resistive Switching Crossbar Arrays Based on Layered Materials"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistive switching devices made of layered materials (LMs) have shown interesting performance. However, most studies employ fabrication methods and device structures that are not industry-relevant. In this review, the focus is on the status of crossbar arrays of LMs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resistive switching (RS) devices are metal/insulator/metal cells that can change their electrical resistance when electrical stimuli are applied between the electrodes, and they can be used to store and compute data. Planar crossbar arrays of RS devices can offer a high integration density (&amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;devices mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and this can be further enhanced by stacking them three-dimensionally. The advantage of using layered materials (LMs) in RS devices compared to traditional phase-change materials and metal oxides is that their electrical properties can be adjusted with a higher precision. Here, the key figures-of-merit and procedures to implement LM-based RS devices are defined. LM-based RS devices fabricated using methods compatible with industry are identified and discussed. The focus is on small devices (size&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;9&#160;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) arranged in crossbar structures, since larger devices may be affected by artifacts, such as grain boundaries and flake junctions. How to enhance device performance, so to accelerate the development of this technology, is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
