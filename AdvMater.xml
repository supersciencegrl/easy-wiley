         <title>In Situ Tailored Frustrated Lewis Pairs on Asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In Motifs Domino&#8208;Direct High&#8208;Efficiency Urea Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A domino&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy to access urea of unprecedented selectivity from CO2 and NO3&#8722; is implemented over a Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 catalyst with asymmetric Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In sites. The kinetically preferred NO3RR driving the tandem CO2 activation and C&#9472;N coupling by in situ tailored controllable SFLPs (Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) to complete urea electrosynthesis does not involve CO2RR.








Abstract
The green urea synthesis via co&#8208;electrolysis of waste nitrate and CO2 is alluring but challenging, especially with insufficient selectivity caused by thermodynamic differences and kinetic mismatch between multi&#8208;step conversion processes. Here, a domino effect&#8208;oriented electrosynthesis strategy is showcased to steer cascade reactions in upgrading nitrate and CO2 toward urea of high selectivity on Bi&#8208;doped In2O3 with asymmetric oxygen vacancies (Ov). The conventionally arbitrary reaction mode can be vectored and re&#8208;customized by stable and cumulative *NH2 intermediates in situ derived from priority nitrate reduction reaction, which not only form surface frustrated Lewis pairs (SFLPs, Bi&#9472;Ov&#9472;In&#9472;NH2) with Bi Lewis acid sites to synergistically adsorb and activate CO2 but also provide more opportunities for sluggish C&#9472;N coupling, delivering an unprecedented urea Faradic efficiency of 80.2% and an impressive urea yield of 2.38 &#215; 103&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus RHE. The atomically dispersed Bi sites promote the protonation of *NO to form nucleophilic *NH2 intermediates, which can be stabilized in the electrophilic region mediated by asymmetric Ov, permitting two nucleophilic attacks to complete the C&#9472;N coupling. The domino modeling protocol via positioning a specific intermediate in situ tailors the parallel conversion process and may guide selectivity control of electrosynthesis.

         <title>Kg&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Ultrathin Single&#8208;Crystalline MOF/GO/MOF Sandwich Nanosheets with Elevated Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a scalable method for synthesizing ultrathin single&#8208;crystalline MOF/GO/MOF (MGM) sandwich nanosheets, utilizing graphene oxide (GO) as a structure&#8208;directing agent. The approach achieves kilogram&#8208;scale production with a 98.73% metal&#8208;based yield and demonstrates universality across various ligands. The optimized nanosheets exhibit superior electrochemical performance in aqueous basic zinc batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and oxygen evolution reactions.








Abstract
The scalable preparation of 2D ultrathin metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets remains a significant challenge due to low stripping efficiency and susceptibility to agglomeration. Herein, a facile strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D ultrathin single&#8208;crystal MOF/graphene oxide (GO)/MOF (MGM) sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets based on the Ni/Co&#8208;BDC MOF (BDC = 1,4&#8208;terephthalic acid), with GO serving as a structure&#8208;directing agent. Impressively, 1&#160;kg of MGM nanosheets can be obtained in a single batch with a metal&#8208;based yield of 98.73%. Furthermore, the universality of this strategy is implemented by the successful synthesis of three additional 2D ultrathin nanosheets: MGM7&#8208;ABDC, MGM7&#8208;FBDC, and MGM7&#8208;BPDC (metal = Ni, Co; ligands = 2&#8208;aminoterephthalic acid (2&#8208;ABDC), 2&#8208;fluoroterephthalic acid (2&#8208;FBDC), and 4,4&#8242;&#8208; biphenyl dicarboxylic acid (BPDC)). The as&#8208;prepared MGM7 nanosheets (Ni: Co ratio = 7:3) exhibit excellent electrochemical performance as the cathode for aqueous basic zinc battery (159.2&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1), anode for sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB, 593.0&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), and electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER, 224&#160;mV overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), significantly outperforming both bulk MOFs and conventional MOF nanosheets. This work enables the scalable synthesis of 2D MOF nanosheets with enhanced properties for multiple applications.

         <title>Sandwich Engineering Advances Ductile Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative sandwich engineering is developed to realize n&#8208;type Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se ductile thermoelectric films, exhibiting a record&#8208;high thermoelectric performance near room&#8208;temperature among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors. The as&#8208;fabricated in&#8208;plane F&#8208;TED achieves an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, ranking among the highest for ductile TEDs, demonstrating promising application potential.








Abstract
Flexible thermoelectrics offer the possibility of utilizing human body heat to generate electricity, enabling self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. Ductile and plastic semiconductors are promising materials for flexible thermoelectrics due to their inherent ductility and tunable electrical properties. However, balancing ductility with high thermoelectric performance remains challenging, especially for n&#8208;type materials. Here, a novel n&#8208;type ductile Ag2(S, Se)&#8208;Ag2Se sandwich&#8208;like thermoelectric film is designed with different functional layers, where the Ag2(S, Se) core layer provides ductile deformation ability and low thermal conductivity, while epitaxially grown highly oriented Ag2Se shell layers ensure superior electrical transport performance. This architecture achieves a record high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit near room&#8208;temperature range, 0.91 at 323 K, among n&#8208;type ductile semiconductors while preserving excellent flexibility. Additionally, a flexible in&#8208;plane device fabricated from this material delivers an exceptional power density of 26.5&#160;W m&#8722;2 at a temperature difference of 50 K, demonstrating its great application potential for wearable electronics. Importantly, such novel sandwich engineering can pave the way to alleviate the compromise between thermoelectric performance and ductility in inorganic semiconductors.

Geometric Design Strategy for Solid Electrolyte Interphase
In article number 2418773, Jong&#8208;Won Lee, Seungbum Hong, Nam&#8208;Soon Choi, and colleagues demonstrate that a solid electrolyte interphase enriched with small grains enhances Li+ ion transport by providing abundant pathways. Moreover, a soft&#8208;solvating environment improves the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Additionally, replacing ethylene carbonate with isobutyronitrile enables a high discharge capacity during rapid charging while mitigating Li plating.

Interlocking Antiphase Boundary
In article number 2416616, Xi Shen, Jun Miao, Richeng Yu, and co&#8208;workers report a coupling phenomenon between the antiphase boundary (APB) and the 180&#176; ferroelectric domain wall in PbTiO3, which is referred to as the antiphase ferroelectric boundary (APFB). It also illustrates the potential applications of APFBs in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the coupling feature. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and could be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Strategic Development of Memristors for Neuromorphic Systems: Low&#8208;Power and Reconfigurable Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates technological trends in brain&#8208;inspired artificial reconfigurable memristors, as well as individual non&#8208;volatile and volatile devices, according to their operating principles and fabrication methods. It examines case studies of artificial neural network system implementations based on these devices, providing the latest comprehensive design guidelines from fundamentals to advanced systems.








Abstract
The ongoing global energy crisis has heightened the demand for low&#8208;power electronic devices, driving interest in neuromorphic computing inspired by the parallel processing of human brains and energy efficiency. Reconfigurable memristors, which integrate both volatile and non&#8208;volatile behaviors within a single unit, offer a powerful solution for in&#8208;memory computing, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck that limits conventional computing architectures. These versatile devices combine the high density, low power consumption, and adaptability of memristors, positioning them as superior alternatives to traditional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology for emulating brain&#8208;like functions. Despite their potential, studies on reconfigurable memristors remain sparse and are often limited to specific materials such as Mott insulators without fully addressing their unique reconfigurability. This review specifically focuses on reconfigurable memristors, examining their dual&#8208;mode operation, diverse physical mechanisms, structural designs, material properties, switching behaviors, and neuromorphic applications. It highlights the recent advancements in low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption solutions within memristor&#8208;based neural networks and critically evaluates the challenges in deploying reconfigurable memristors as standalone devices or within artificial neural systems. The review provides in&#8208;depth technical insights and quantitative benchmarks to guide the future development and implementation of reconfigurable memristors in low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Responsive Molecules for Organic Neuromorphic Devices: Harnessing Memory Diversification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecules are essential for organic in&#8208;sensor computing devices. This Review highlights recent advances in thedesign, synthesis, and incorporation of electrically, optically, and magnetically responsive molecules in multifunctional synaptic perception devices endowedwith both nonvolatile and volatile memory diversification. By exploiting the multifunctional nature of molecular switches, complex logic operations can be accomplished, bringing molecule&#8208;based neuromorphic computing closer to become a real technology.








Abstract
In the brain, both the recording and decaying of memory information following external stimulus spikes are fundamental learning rules that determine human behaviors. The former is essential to acquire new knowledge and update the database, while the latter filters noise and autorefresh cache data to reduce energy consumption. To execute these functions, the brain relies on different neuromorphic transmitters possessing various memory kinetics, which can be classified as nonvolatile and volatile memory. Inspired by the human brain, nonvolatile and volatile memory electronic devices have been employed to realize artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks, respectively, which have emerged as essential tools in machine learning. Molecular switches, capable of responding to electrical, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic stimuli, display a disruptive potential for emulating information storage in memory devices. This Review highlights recent developments on responsive molecules, their interfacing with low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures and nanomaterials, and their integration into electronic devices. By capitalizing on these concepts, a unique account of neurotransmitter&#8208;transfer electronic devices based on responsive molecules with ad hoc memory kinetics is provided. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed on the use of these devices to engineer more complex logic operations and computing functions at the hardware level.

This Review highlights recent advances in thedesign, synthesis, and incorporation of electrically, optically, and magnetically responsive molecules in multifunctional synaptic perception devices endowedwith both nonvolatile and volatile memory diversification. By exploiting the multifunctional nature of molecular switches, complex logic operations can be accomplished, bringing molecule-based neuromorphic computing closer to become a real technology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the brain, both the recording and decaying of memory information following external stimulus spikes are fundamental learning rules that determine human behaviors. The former is essential to acquire new knowledge and update the database, while the latter filters noise and autorefresh cache data to reduce energy consumption. To execute these functions, the brain relies on different neuromorphic transmitters possessing various memory kinetics, which can be classified as nonvolatile and volatile memory. Inspired by the human brain, nonvolatile and volatile memory electronic devices have been employed to realize artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks, respectively, which have emerged as essential tools in machine learning. Molecular switches, capable of responding to electrical, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic stimuli, display a disruptive potential for emulating information storage in memory devices. This Review highlights recent developments on responsive molecules, their interfacing with low-dimensional nanostructures and nanomaterials, and their integration into electronic devices. By capitalizing on these concepts, a unique account of neurotransmitter-transfer electronic devices based on responsive molecules with ad hoc memory kinetics is provided. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed on the use of these devices to engineer more complex logic operations and computing functions at the hardware level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Anisotropic Microcarriers: Fabrication Strategies and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have gained prominence for their morphological versatility. This review synthesizes two decades of advances in AM development, from fabrication strategies to multifunctional biomedical applications (cell coculture, multidrug delivery, tissue scaffolds, and 3D bioprinting). Systematic analysis of morphology&#8208;dependent effects underscores opportunities for optimizing AM utilization and establishing morphology&#8208;driven innovation frameworks in biomedicine.








Abstract
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have attracted increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been made to explore AMs with various morphologies, their full potential is yet to be realized, as most studies have primarily focused on materials or fabrication methods. A thorough analysis of the interactional and interdependent relationships between these factors is required, along with proposed countermeasures tailored for researchers from various backgrounds. These countermeasures include specific fabrication strategies for various morphologies and guidelines for selecting the most suitable AM for certain biomedical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of AMs, ranging from their fabrication methods to biomedical applications, based on the past two decades of research, is provided. The fabrication of various morphologies is investigated using different strategies and their corresponding biomedical applications. By systematically examining these morphology&#8208;dependent effects, a better utilization of AMs with diverse morphologies can be achieved and clear strategies for breakthroughs in the biomedical field are established. Additionally, certain challenges are identified, new frontiers are opened, and promising and exciting opportunities are provided for fabricating functional AMs with broad implications across various fields that must be addressed in biomaterials and biotechnology.

         <title>Cartilage&#8208;Adaptive Hydrogels via the Synergy Strategy of Protein Templating and Mechanical Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels), via the synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training, achieve cartilage&#8208;like structure and mechanical performances, as well as high&#8208;water retention similar to cartilage. The resulting O&#8208;CN gels has excellent prospects in load&#8208;bearing cartilage engineering application.








Abstract
Cartilage, as a load&#8208;bearing tissue with high&#8208;water content, exhibits excellent elasticity and high strength. However, it is still a grand challenge to develop cartilage&#8208;adaptive biomaterials for replacement or regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Herein, protein templating and mechanical training is integrated to fabricate crystal&#8208;mediated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels) with similar mechanical properties and water content of cartilage. The O&#8208;CN gels with an &#8776;74 wt% water content exhibit high tensile strength (&#8776;15.4 MPa) and Young's modulus (&#8776;24.1 MPa), as well as excellent biocompatibility, antiswelling properties, and antibacterial capabilities. When implanted in the box defect of rat's tails, the O&#8208;CN gels seal the cartilage (annulus fibrosus) defect, maintain the intervertebral disc height and finally prevent the nucleus herniation. This synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training opens up a new possibility to design highly mechanical hydrogels, especially for the replacement and regeneration of load&#8208;bearing tissues.

         <title>Multimodal Finger&#8208;Shaped Tactile Sensor for Multi&#8208;Directional Force and Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor inspired by human fingers is developed, capable of simultaneous normal and shear force detection and 98.33% accurate material identification. Integrated into a robot hand and arm system, it enables real&#8208;time detection of gripping force, material identification, advancing haptic sensing in robotics.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception is crucial for advancing human&#8211;computer interaction, but real&#8208;time multidimensional force detection and material identification remain challenging. Here, a finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor (FTS) based on the triboelectric effect is proposed, capable of multidirectional force sensing and material identification. The FTS is composed of an external material identification section and an internal force sensing section. Three materials are embedded into the surface of the silicone shell in the fingerpad, forming single&#8208;electrode sensors for material identification. In the force sensing section, the silicone shell's outer surface is coated with conductive silver paste as a shielding layer. The inner wall has four silicone microneedle arrays and a silicone bump, while five silver electrodes are coated on the internal polylactic acid skeleton. The components connect via interlocking structures near the fingernail, allowing localized contact and separation between the silicone shell and skeleton, enabling force direction detection through signals from the five electrodes. Additionally, the outer sensors achieve 98.33% accuracy in recognizing 12 materials. Furthermore, integrated into a robotic hand, the FTS enables real&#8208;time material identification and force detection in an intelligent sorting environment. This research holds great potential for applications in tactile perception for intelligent robotics.

         <title>Visible Periodic Piezoelectric Domains in Silk Fibroin for Neurite&#8208;Orientated Extension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric SF film with visible periodic piezoelectric domains and excellent biocompatibility is fabricated through a feasible photochemical method with silver nanoparticles as the developer and mediator simultaneously. Consequently, the oriented piezoelectric electric field is achieved under ultrasound and effectively regulates the directional growth and length of neurite and neural gene expression.








Abstract
The development of visible periodic piezoelectric domains is highly attractive but challenging to overcome the homogeneous distribution and lack of visualization of the electric field on traditional piezopolymers. This work reports an in situ synthesis to create customized silver patterns with micron&#8208;level distinguishability. This method serves to form visible periodic piezoelectric domains and endows the silk fibroin (SF) piezoelectric generator with maximum root mean square current, energy density, and voltage of 5.1&#160;mA, 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and 529.5&#160;mV, respectively, under an ultrasound intensity of 1.0&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The oriented piezoelectric electric field is periodically distributed into the SF film with ultrasound&#8208;driven assistance and remarkably regulates neurite directional growth, length, and gene expression. Additionally, these piezoelectric domains enable the direct and timely observation of the electric field's effect on neurites by biological microscopy.

     alt="Visible Periodic Piezoelectric Domains in Silk Fibroin for Neurite-Orientated Extension"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piezoelectric SF film with visible periodic piezoelectric domains and excellent biocompatibility is fabricated through a feasible photochemical method with silver nanoparticles as the developer and mediator simultaneously. Consequently, the oriented piezoelectric electric field is achieved under ultrasound and effectively regulates the directional growth and length of neurite and neural gene expression.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of visible periodic piezoelectric domains is highly attractive but challenging to overcome the homogeneous distribution and lack of visualization of the electric field on traditional piezopolymers. This work reports an in situ synthesis to create customized silver patterns with micron-level distinguishability. This method serves to form visible periodic piezoelectric domains and endows the silk fibroin (SF) piezoelectric generator with maximum root mean square current, energy density, and voltage of 5.1&#160;mA, 6.7&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 529.5&#160;mV, respectively, under an ultrasound intensity of 1.0&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The oriented piezoelectric electric field is periodically distributed into the SF film with ultrasound-driven assistance and remarkably regulates neurite directional growth, length, and gene expression. Additionally, these piezoelectric domains enable the direct and timely observation of the electric field's effect on neurites by biological microscopy. This approach paves the way for great potential in tailored electric stimulation for cell biology and medical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Eye&#8208;Drop Nano&#8208;Formulation of Catalase Self&#8208;Assembled with Thiolated Chitosan for Effective Treatment of Dry Eye Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan is designed. The obtained nanoparticles after eye&#8208;drop administration could form disulfide bonds with the mucin layer of the team film to achieve enhanced precorneal adhesion, so as to continuously eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species accumulated in the ocular surface to suppress inflammation, resulting in effective treatment of dry eye disease.








Abstract
Dry eye disease (DED), the most prevalent ophthalmological condition worldwide, can cause severe ocular discomfort and even visual impairment. Effective yet safe therapeutics for severe DED are still highly demanded. Herein, considering the important role of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in triggering DED, an eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase (CAT) self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan (CS&#8208;Cys) is designed for DED treatment. Upon eye&#8208;drop administration of CS&#8208;Cys/CAT nanoparticles, CS&#8208;Cys can form disulfide bonds with abundant thiols in the mucin layer of the tear film, anchoring catalase to the corneal surface. Thus the excess ROS accumulated on the ocular surface can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a regulated tear microenvironment. In mouse and rabbit models, it is verified that CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops can offer excellent therapeutic effects, especially in promoting the recovery of damaged epithelium and increasing tear secretion. Remarkably, CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops showed notably better therapeutic performance than clinically used cyclosporin and dexamethasone, as well as several new DED drugs in clinical trials. Thus, the work presents a unique nanoparticulate eye&#8208;drop&#8208;based ocular delivery system to allow prolonged ocular retention of protein therapeutics, and such nanoformulation formulated by fully biocompatible/biodegradable components possesses significant translational potential for effective and safe DED treatment.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Ionic Engineering of Antiferromagnetically RKKY&#8208;Coupled Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random&#8208;access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage&#8208;driven ion migration (i.e., magneto&#8208;ionics) enables post&#8208;synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto&#8208;ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non&#8208;magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto&#8208;ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum&#8208;group metals. In this work, room&#8208;temperature voltage control of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni&#8208;based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion&#8208;like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage&#8208;driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage&#8208;triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post&#8208;synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic&#8208;field sensing, energy&#8208;efficient memories and spintronics.

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Ammonium Ion&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by the Synergy of ORR and NH4+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synergistic interplay between oxygen reduction reaction and NH4+ storage, and harnesses the synergy for the successful development of a high&#8208;rate and highly stable ammonium ion air battery (AIAB). The assembled AIAB demonstrates outstanding rate performance (89 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (78 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 9369 W kg&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) offer cost&#8208;effectiveness, nontoxicity, and eco&#8208;friendly attributes in energy storage technology. However, the constrained capacity and poor stability of conventional cathode materials have impeded their widespread adoption. Herein, a synergistic approach is introduced to overcome these challenges, by enhancing the air cathode with NH4+ and simultaneously leveraging atmospheric oxygen as a reservoir for NH4+ storage. Notably, NH4+ significantly enhances the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in neutral environments. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and quantum density functional theory calculations, it is elucidated how NH4+ can act as a proton donor, replacing H2O in neutral media and reducing energy barriers in the protonation of *O2&#8722; and *O, thereby accelerating ORR kinetics. The resulting ammonium ion&#8208;air battery, comprising an air cathode and a polymer (PNP) anode, showcases impressive metrics: high energy density of 78 Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 9369 W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, an initial capacity of 94.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability (70.4% capacity retention after 12&#160;500 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1. This pioneering research highlights the synergistic relationship between ORR and NH4+ storage and opens up new avenues for the design and advancement of innovative, sustainable, and environment&#8208;friendly AIBs.

         <title>Interlocking Antiphase Boundary with 180&#176; Domain Wall in PbTiO3 &#8211; Antiphase Ferroelectric Boundary</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180&#176; conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB)&#160;and conventional 180&#176; domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy&#8208;tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

&lt;p&gt;This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180&#176; conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB)&#160;and conventional 180&#176; domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy-tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out-of-plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Interfacial H2O Activity and H2 Bubbles by Core/Shell Nanoarrays for 800 h Stable Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve activity and stability for seawater electrolysis under high current densities, the problems of firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles with core/shell nanoarrays, addressed which further regulates the interfacial H2O activity to reduce overpotentials, hence highlighting its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible application for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
The catalytic activity and stability under high current densities for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are impeded by firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles to the catalytic sites. Herein, we systematically synthesize core/shell nanoarrays to engineer bubble transport channels, which further remarkably regulate interfacial H2O activity, and swift H2 bubble generation and release. The self&#8208;supported catalyst holds uniform ultra&#8208;low Ru active sites of 0.38&#160;wt% and promotes the rapid formation of plentiful small H2 bubbles, which are rapidly released by the upright channels, mitigating the blockage of active sites and avoiding surface damage from bubble movements. As a result, these core/shell nanoarrays achieve ultralow overpotentials of 18 and 24 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1 M KOH freshwater and seawater, respectively. Additionally, the assembled electrolyzer demonstrates stable durability over 800 hours with a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH seawater. The techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the unit cost of the hydrogen production system is nearly half of the DOE's (Department of Energy) 2026 target. Our work addresses the stability challenges of HER and highlights its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible solution for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production of seawater.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI), which can be effectively used to fabricate high&#8208;quality twisted heterostructures, including monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like heterostructure. It also enables the fabrication of suspended 2DMs and high&#8208;performance devices. This technique features excellent scalability, advancing fundamental research on 2DMs, and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.









Abstract
Transfer technique has become an indispensable process in the development of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) and their heterostructures, as it determines the quality of the interface and the performance of the resulting devices. However, how to flexibly and conveniently fabricate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) twisted heterostructures with high&#8208;quality interfaces has always been a formidable challenge. Here, a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI) is developed, which can be flexibly used to fabricate twisted heterostructures. This method leverages a charged hydrophilic surface to facilitate WVI at the interface, enabling the clean and uniform detachment of 2DMs from the substrate. Using this method, the twisted monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like WS2/MoS2, highlighting the surface/interface cleanness and angle&#8208;controlled transfer method is successfully fabricated. Besides, suspended structures of these 2DMs and heterostructures are fabricated, which offers substantial convenience for studying their intrinsic physical properties. Further, a high&#8208;performance hBN/graphene/hBN superlattice device with the mobility of &#8776;199,000&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at room temperature is fabricated. This transfer technique ingeniously combines the advantages of dry transfer and wet transfer. Moreover, it features excellent scalability, providing crucial technical support for future research on the fundamental physical properties of 2DMs and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.

         <title>Localized and Controllable Mineral Salts Crystallization Enabled by Dye Modified Gold Nanorods with Enhanced Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO3, BaCO3, and SrCO3, is realized using 638 nm laser light.








Abstract
Well&#8208;designed nanomaterials with favorable photothermal performance are beneficial for exploring fascinating and prospective applications. Herein the facile and effective way is reported to enhance photothermal properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) through immobilizing tailored organic dyes around GNRs. Benefitting from the combination of plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation, the modified GNRs exhibit a temperature increase of &gt;100&#160;&#176;C under 638&#160;nm laser irradiation in film state, which is double of that of the bare GNRs&#8208;doped film under the same condition. The hybrid film also exhibits superior stability and reusability compared to the film only doped with the dyes. Surface temperature of the hybrid film can be adjusted from 31 to 116&#160;&#176;C by tunning either doping materials concentration or light power. Interestingly, the hybrid film serves as a reusable energy converter in confined and controllable photothermal crystallization of mineral salts. NaCl crystals can be arranged into different patterns by moving the laser probe during the crystallization. Microcrystals of CaCO3 (calcite, vaterite, and aragonite), BaCO3, and SrCO3 are successfully obtained. It is believed that the as&#8208;prepared materials as well as the demonstrated photothermal crystallization will contribute to the development of function&#8208;led photothermal materials.

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Trimetallic Atom Catalysts Enable Targeted ROS Generation and Redox Signaling for Intensive Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical paradigm to utilize hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (CCF TACs@NVs) with a stable symmetrical pyramid structure for catalytic guided apoptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;induced cell death, which is provided by the multi&#8208;enzymes like abilities under effective tumor aggregation, highlighting the application prospects in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in cellular metabolic processes by acting as primary intracellular chemical substrates and secondary messengers for cellular signal modulation. However, the artificial engineering of nanozymes to generate ROS is restricted by their low catalytic efficiency, high toxicity, and off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) anchored on a stable symmetrical pyramid structure are designed in the presence of N and P surface ligands from cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene interlayer&#8208;coated MIL&#8208;101(Fe). The 3D network TACs with a uniform dispersion of Cu, Co, and Fe hetero&#8208;single atoms effectively tailor the active sites to avoid metal sintering, thereby providing sufficient catalytic activity for ROS blooms. Nanovesicle membranes facilitate the stable accumulation of nanozymes with homologous targeting, recognition, and endocytosis, effectively addressing the potentially high toxicity and off&#8208;target defects. Therefore, the outcome of the in situ ROS&#8208;bloom acts as a redox signal for directly regulating oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, ROS intervene in the glutathione peroxidase 4, long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 4, and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase&#8208;3 pathways as second messengers, fostering the proclivity toward apoptosis and lipid peroxidation&#8208;regulated ferroptosis pathway concurrently, thereby highlighting the application prospects of TACs in the biomedical field.

Herein, hetero-trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) anchored on a stable symmetrical pyramid structure are designed in the presence of N and P surface ligands from cross-linked polyphosphazene interlayer-coated MIL-101(Fe). The 3D network TACs with a uniform dispersion of Cu, Co, and Fe hetero-single atoms effectively tailor the active sites to avoid metal sintering, thereby providing sufficient catalytic activity for ROS blooms. Nanovesicle membranes facilitate the stable accumulation of nanozymes with homologous targeting, recognition, and endocytosis, effectively addressing the potentially high toxicity and off-target defects. Therefore, the outcome of the in situ ROS-bloom acts as a redox signal for directly regulating oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, ROS intervene in the glutathione peroxidase 4, long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4, and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 pathways as second messengers, fostering the proclivity toward apoptosis and lipid peroxidation-regulated ferroptosis pathway concurrently, thereby highlighting the application prospects of TACs in the biomedical field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multicolor Rare&#8208;Earth Film with Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow for Diverse Energy&#8208;Saving Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study fabricates a large&#8208;area multicolor rare&#8208;earth afterglow film via electrospinning, integrating ZnS and tricolor rare&#8208;earth phosphors to achieve ultra&#8208;long afterglow (&gt;30 h) and tunable emissions. The film exhibits thermoluminescence, environmental stability, and light&#8208;capturing capabilities, enabling applications in fire&#8208;rescue gear, greenhouses, and energy&#8208;efficient tunnel/garage lighting. Its scalable production and cost&#8208;effectiveness advance energy&#8208;saving technologies in agriculture, safety, and urban infrastructure.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth afterglow materials, with their unique light&#8208;storage properties, show great promise for diverse applications. However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare&#8208;earth phosphors including (Sr0.75Ca0.25)S:Eu2+; SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+ and Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large&#8208;area (0.4&#160;m &#215; 3&#160;m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire&#8208;rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24&#8208;h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real&#8208;world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology.

         <title>Revisiting the &#8220;Stick&#8208;Slip&#8221; Process via Magnetism&#8208;Coupled Flexible Sensors with Bioinspired Ridge Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like device for stick&#8208;slip perception is developed, featuring a deformable bioinspired ridge layer with capability of lateral deformation and fast recovery. Coupled with magnetized functionality, the morphological transformation is capable to induce periodical electrical pulses which allows to revisit the stick&#8208;slip process when human fingertip scans across a specific surface.








Abstract
&#8220;Stick&#8208;slip&#8221; phenomenon that occurs when human fingertip scans across a specific surface is essential to perceive the interactions between skin and the surface. Understanding the &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior is important for bionic flexible system in applications from advanced robotics to intelligent tactile sensors. However, it is often overlooked owing to the limitations to mimic the soft skin that can tangentially deform/recover with informative electrical feedback. Here, a sandwich&#8208;type device with deformable ridge&#8208;layer is proposed to analyze the characteristic of stick/slip states in &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; process. Specifically, it is observed that fast recovery of the sensing architecture is caused by dynamic slip phase that generates periodical signals based on principle of induction. The results experimentally show that periods of the electrical pulses are dependent on factors such as inherent properties (e.g., modulus and geometry) and operational parameters (e.g., scanning speed and normal load), which is consistent with the theoretical model. Furthermore, it is found that the transition between &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; and full slip could qualitatively reflect interfacial properties such as moisture, roughness, and topology. It is expected that the results can strengthen the understanding of &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior when fingertip interacts with a surface and provide guidance of flexible sensor design to enrich the biomimetic perceptions.

         <title>Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;grain&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft&#8208;solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile&#8208;based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast&#8208;charging of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile&#8208;based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN&#8208;containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Selective Growth of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Nanocrystals with Optimized Crystal Forms for In Vivo Optical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in the field of in vivo optical imaging due to their ability to effectively minimize the interference of fluorescence background from biological tissues. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is proposed for preparing UOP nanocrystals with different crystal forms for in vivo biological imaging.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials are valuable for biological imaging to avoid interference from fluorescence background signals because of their delayed emission property. Obtaining nanocrystals with high phosphorescence quantum yield is a critical factor to achieve high&#8208;quality UOP imaging. Herein, a pair of host&#8211;guest UOP doped system with variable crystal forms for the host is constructed. By exploring the relationship between the crystal form of the host and the UOP of the doped system, the importance of host crystal form is revealed to achieve high quantum yield UOP in doped systems. Furthermore, to overcome the low crystallinity and numerous defects faced by traditional bottom&#8208;up strategies for nanocrystal preparation, a strategy is proposed for the selective preparation of nanocrystals with the target crystal form. Through controlling the evaporation rate of the solvent, the ordered growth of crystals can be effectively regulated to obtain nanocrystals with different crystal forms for bioimaging applications.

         <title>Synthetic Active Liquid Crystals Powered by Acoustic Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully synthetic active liquid crystal, energized by an acoustic field, is presented. This system exhibits active nematic behavior, tunable topological defect dynamics, and persistent hydrodynamic vortices at high activity levels. The material maintains stable properties while enabling precise activity control in a wide range.








Abstract
Active nematic materials combine orientational order with activity at the microscopic level. Current experimental realizations of active nematics include vibrating elongated particles, cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria, and a mixture of bio&#8208;filaments with molecular motors. The majority of active nematics are of biological origin. The realization of a fully synthetic active liquid crystal comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves, is reported. This synthetic active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits phenomenology associated with active nematics, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. It is demonstrated that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long&#8208;range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability and proliferation of topological defects. The emergence of unconventional free&#8208;standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels is revealed. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active liquid crystals with stable material properties and tunable topological defect dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic&#160;systems.

         <title>1D Magnetic Topological Inorganic Electrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1D stable magnetic inorganic electrides are identified by high throughput screening and experimental synthesis. Furthermore, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit various applications, including spintronics, topological electronics, low work function, electron emission, and high&#8208;performance catalysts for NH3 reductions.








Abstract
Inorganic electrides, which are characterized by the presence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) within distinct geometric cavities, exhibit unique properties and have garnered significant attention in various fields. Nevertheless, inorganic electrides face significant challenges in terms of their stability and magnetic topological states. To address these issues, a combination of high&#8208;throughput screening, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental synthesis is used to identify a series of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides with diverse properties and applications. Specifically, 17 ferromagnetic (FM) and 19 antiferromagnetic (AFM) 1D inorganic electrides, with different topological bulk and surface states are reported. Moreover, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit lower work functions (&#8776;3&#160;eV) on the (001) surface, significantly enhancing their applications in ammonia synthesis. Further experimental synthesis and characterization suggested that 1D inorganic electrides exhibit extremely high stability owing to the strong hybridization between IAEs and atoms and the small surface area of IAEs. These findings involve the screening, investigation, preparation, and application of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides, heralding a new era in the study of 1D inorganic electrides in topological quantum science, spintronics, energy, and the corresponding interdisciplinary areas.

         <title>LiC6@Li as a Promising Substitution of Li Metal Counter Electrode for Low&#8208;Temperature Battery Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a LiC6@Li counter electrode, as an alternative to Li metal for more precisely evaluating the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials at low temperatures. The low interfacial resistances facilitate preferential de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ from LiC6, resulting in a sharp decreased over&#8208;potential at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the rapid replenishment of Li+ through the solid&#8211;solid&#8208;connection reaction maintains stable LiC6@Li potential.








Abstract
Li metal, as a counter electrode, is widely used for electrode materials evaluation in coin type half&#8208;cells. However, whether this configuration is suitable for different working conditions has often been neglected. Herein, the large resistance and high cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of Li metal at low temperature are highlighted, revealing its incompetence as counter electrode on cryogenic condition. In view of this, a novel LiC6@Li composite electrode is developed as a promising substitution for electrode materials evaluation. In the LiC6@Li electrode, Li+ de&#8208;intercalated from LiC6 preferentially due to the low interface resistance of LiC6, presenting a cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of 0.05&#160;V (67&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is ten times lower than that of Li metal. Moreover, the rapid lithium replenishment into LiC6 from Li metal enables a stable potential of LiC6@Li. Consequently, the LiC6@Li&#8208;based half&#8208;cells enabled more precise evaluation of the Li+ storage potential and specific capacities of a series of electrode materials at low temperature. As an extension, KC8@K is also successfully prepared as a superior counter electrode to K metal. This work proposes a suitable counter electrode for more accurately evaluating electrode materials at subfreezing scenarios, demonstrating the necessity of specialized electrode evaluation systems for particular operating conditions.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Exciton&#8208;Involved Dual&#8208;Channel Stepwise Energy Transfer Enabling Efficient and Stable Blue OLEDs with Narrow Emission and High Luminance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailor&#8208;made blue organic emitter with hot exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics serves as a sensitizer in the innovative sensitizing system with a dual&#8208;channel stepwise energy transfer feature. The established material and device approach enables efficient, stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with narrow emission and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance.








Abstract
Marching toward next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;definition and high&#8208;resolution displays, the development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrow emission and high luminance is essential and requires conceptual advancements in both molecular and device design. Herein, a blue organic emitter is reported that exhibits hot&#8208;exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics, and use it as a sensitizer in the proposed triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;assisted hot&#8208;exciton&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (HSF) device, abbreviated THSF. Results show that through dual&#8208;channel stepwise F&#246;rster and Dexter energy transfer processes, the THSF system can simultaneously enhance exciton utilization, accelerate exciton dynamics, and reduce the concentration of triplet excitons. The smooth management of excitons makes the overall performance of the THSF device superior to the control TTA fluorescence and HSF devices. Furthermore, a high&#8208;performance narrowband blue (CIEx,y = 0.13, 0.12) OLED is achieved using a two&#8208;unit tandem device design, providing an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.3%, a record&#8208;high L90% (the luminance where the &#414;ext drops to 90% of its peak value) of &#8776;20&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a long half&#8208;lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 initial luminance of &#8776;13&#160;256&#160;h. These results showcase the great potential of the THSF strategy in realizing efficient and stable blue OLEDs with narrow emission and high luminance.

Abstract
Wireless powering of rechargeable&#8208;implantable medical devices presents a challenge in developing reliable wireless energy transfer systems that meet medical safety and standards. Ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (US&#8208;TENG) are investigated for various medical applications, including noninvasive percutaneous wireless battery powering to reduce the need for multiple surgeries for battery replacement. However, these devices often suffer from inefficiency due to limited output performance and rigidity. To address this issue, a dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) capable of producing a high output charge with low&#8208;intensity ultrasound and a long probe distance is developed, comparatively. The feasibility and output stability of this deformable and augmented device is confirmed under various bending conditions, making it suitable for use in the body's curved positions or with electronic implants. The device achieved an output of &#8776;26&#160;V and &#8776;6.7&#160;mW output for remote charging of a rechargeable battery at a 35&#160;mm distance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the output&#8208;augmented US&#8208;TENG for deep short&#8208;term wireless charging of implantable electronics with flexing conditions in curved devices such as future total artificial hearts.

         <title>Ultraviolet Optoelectronic Synapse Based on AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN Heterojunction for Advanced Artificial Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers have developed a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ferroelectric memristor with ultraviolet photoelectric synapse function, enabling nonvolatile memory and optoelectronic synaptic characteristics. This innovation achieves a high memory on/off ratio and a relatively low synaptic energy consumption, advancing optoelectronics and artificial vision systems with potential applications in on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials represent a frontier in semiconductor research, offering the potential for novel optoelectronics. AlScN material is a kind of outstanding ferroelectric semiconductor with strong residual polarization, high Curie temperature, and mainstream semiconductor fabrication compatibility. However, it is challenging to realize multi&#8208;state optical responders due to their limited light sensitivity. Here, a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse is fabricated, overcoming this limitation by leveraging hole capture at the AlScN/p&#8208;GaN hetero&#8208;interface for multi&#8208;state modulation. The novel structure maintains excellent memristor characteristics based on the ferroelectric of AlScN, realizing an on/off ratio of 9.36&#160;&#215;&#160;105. More importantly, the device can mimic synaptic characteristics essential for artificial vision systems, achieving an image recognition accuracy of 93.7% with a weight evolution nonlinearity of 0.26. This approach not only extends the applications of AlScN in optoelectronics but also paves the way for advanced artificial vision systems with image preprocessing and recognition capabilities. The findings provide a step forward in the development of non&#8208;volatile memories with potential for on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) inspired by the biomechanical properties of human fingertips. The AI&#8208;LMS demonstrates superior performance in multidimensional pressure sensing, characterized by high linearity and stability. Potential applications encompass enhancing robotic tactile perception and facilitating precise 3D surface scanning, representing a significant milestone in the field of soft robotics technology.








Abstract
The advancement of robotic behavior and intelligence has led to an urgent demand for improving their sensitivity and interactive capabilities, which presents challenges in achieving multidimensional, wide&#8208;ranging, and reliable tactile sensing. Here an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) is introduced inspired by the human fingertip, which inherently possesses the capability to detect spatially multi&#8208;axis pressure with a wide sensing range, exceptional linearity, and signal stability. Additionally, it can detect very small pressures and responds swiftly to prescribed forces. Compared to resistive signals, inductive signals offer significant advantages. Further, integrated with a deep neural network model, the AI&#8208;LMS can decouple multi&#8208;axis pressures acting simultaneously upon it. Notably, the sensing range of Ecoflex and PDMS&#8208;based AI&#8208;LMS can be expanded by a factor of 4 and 9.5, respectively. For practical illustrations, a high&#8208;precision surface scanning reconstruction system is developed capable of capturing intricate details of 3D surface profiles. The utilization of biomimetic AI&#8208;LMS as robotic fingertips enables real&#8208;time discrimination of diverse delicate grasping behaviors across different fingers. The innovations and unique features in sensing mechanisms and structural design are expected to bring transformative changes and find extensive applications in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Based on Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) design that leverages carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Harnessing Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions enables the development of a synergistic microporous structure that confines phosphoric acid clusters, enhancing proton conductivity and durability. This work addresses critical challenges in PEM development, while proposing a solutionfor&#160;the design of next&#8208;generation membranes.









Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) is regarded as a promising energy conversion system owing to simplified water management and enhanced tolerance to fuel impurities. However, phosphoric acid (PA) leaching remains a critical issue, diminishing energy density and durability, posing significant obstacle to the commercial development of HT&#8208;PEMFCs. To address this, composite membranes incorporating the carboxylic acid&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) are designed as framework polymer, blended with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. The Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions between cPIM&#8208;1 and PVP created an extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, improving membrane compatibility. The optimized microporous structure and multiple anchoring sites gave rise to &#8220;domain&#8208;limited&#8221; PA clusters, enhancing the capillary effect. Simultaneously, improved hydrophobicity synergistically optimizes catalytic interface, promoting continuous and stable proton transfer. The HT&#8208;PEMFCs based on PVP/cPIM&#8208;1 composite membrane achieved a peak power density of 1090.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 160&#160;&#176;C, representing a 152% improvement compared to PVP/PES membrane. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent durability, with a voltage decay of 0.058&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1 over 210&#160;h of accelerated stress test corresponds to more than 5000&#160;h of constant current density durability test. This study presents a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and durable novel membranes in various energy conversion systems.

         <title>Critical Roles of Ultrafast Energy Funnelling and Ultrafast Singlet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Optical Gain Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast broadband photoluminescence spectroscopy provides insights into the lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation in mixed&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Rapid energy funnelling to the sites of amplified spontaneous emission occurs within sub&#8208;picosecond timescales. However, the accumulation of triplet excitons effectively quenches incoming singlet excitons, creating a bottleneck in the energy cascade and hindering the development of population inversion.









Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q2D) perovskite possess considerable potential for light emission and amplification technologies. Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap&#8208;mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo&#8208;excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum&#8208;confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed&#8208;layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub&#8208;picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrafast broadband photoluminescence spectroscopy provides insights into the lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet-triplet annihilation in mixed-layer quasi-2D perovskites. Rapid energy funnelling to the sites of amplified spontaneous emission occurs within sub-picosecond timescales. However, the accumulation of triplet excitons effectively quenches incoming singlet excitons, creating a bottleneck in the energy cascade and hindering the development of population inversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D (Q2D) perovskite possess considerable potential for light emission and amplification technologies. Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap-mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo-excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum-confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed-layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub-picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses. Further accumulation of triplets creates a bottleneck in the energy cascade, effectively quenching incoming singlet excitons. This ultrafast annihilation within 200 femtosecond outpaces energy transfer to ASE sites, preventing the build-up of population inversion. This study highlights the significance of investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales, encompassing lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet-triplet annihilation, to gain crucial insights into the photophysics of the optical gain process in Q2D perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lignin&#8208;Based Separators for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries via a Dry Fibrillation Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Can lignin revolutionize lithium&#8208;ion battery separators? A single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) is fabricated using a dry fibrillation method, enabling exceptional thermal stability, low energy consumption, and full material utilization. Sulfonate functional groups enhance interfacial stability, significantly improving cycling in graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells. This scalable, sustainable approach paves the way for next&#8208;generation functional separators.








Abstract
Separators are critical components in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), preventing internal short circuits, mitigating thermal runaway, and influencing rate capability and cycling performance. However, current polyolefin separators suffer from limitations, such as high thermal shrinkage, relatively poor wettability, and inadequate long&#8208;term stability, impacting safety and cycle life in critical applications like electric vehicles. Here, a single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) with exceptional intrinsic thermal stability and cycling performance is demonstrated. The separator is fabricated using lignosulfonate, a natural polymer derived as a byproduct of chemical pulping and biorefinery processes. By employing a dry fibrillation method, the process achieves low energy consumption and a 100% raw material conversion rate, highlighting its scalability and sustainability. Interfacial studies reveal the improved cycling performance in both graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells is attributed to the abundant sulfonate functional groups in lignosulfonates, which promote the formation of a sulfur&#8208;rich cathode/solid electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) with low resistance in both the cathode and anode. The high thermal stability, manufacturing feasibility, battery performance, and low cost of such lignin&#8208;based separators offer new inspiration for developing next&#8208;generation, single&#8208;layer functional separators tailored for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Universally Applicable and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Cyclic Power Generation Induced by Interfacial Ion&#8208;Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric power generating cell is developed based on potential difference driven reversible ion migration, which generates ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month with a high short&#8208;circuit of over 40&#160;mA and output power density of up to 6&#160;W m&#8722;2, surpassing the values reported for many other sorts of typical electricity generators.









Abstract
Sustainable energy supply without relying on external power sources is one of the bottlenecks in achieving self&#8208;supportive wearable electronics and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) systems. Here a new type of universally applicable and ultra&#8208;long life cyclic power generation is developed induced by interfacial redox reaction&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;oscillation, which can provide cycling electric energy in a self&#8208;charging manner without extra pre&#8208;charge. Based on asymmetric manganese dioxide and molybdenum disulfide electrode pairs, the proof&#8208;concept electric potential difference power generating cell (EPDC) offers ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month testing period for tens of thousands of cycles. A layer&#8208;stacking EPDC unit supplies a high direct current of more than 40&#160;mA and a power density of &#8776;6&#160;W m&#8722;2. Such recyclable power&#8208;generating process mainly relies on reversible ion migration at an asymmetric interface in response to relative variation of electric potentials. The universal applicability of EPDC is validated by a combination of diverse electrode pairs. Large&#8208;scale manufacture of EPDCs is achievable by industry&#8208;compatible auto&#8208;blade coating technology with on&#8208;demand power output, providing a long&#8208;acting power supply platform for self&#8208;charging electronic systems.

         <title>Interfacial Adsorption Layers Based on Amino Acid Analogues to Enable Dual Stabilization toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial adsorption layers based on N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) are constructed to inhibit Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle by employing an electrolyte additive strategy. These layers stabilize Zn anode via creating a &#8220;H2O&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and buffering the interfacial pH, while hindering polyiodide migration at the I2 cathode through ion&#8211;dipole interactions. Attributing to these benefits, a long&#8208;lasting aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery is realized.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the merits of low cost and high safety. However, their commercial application is hindered by Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode. Herein, N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) based interfacial adsorption layers are constructed to stabilize Zn anodes and mitigate polyiodide shuttle according to ion&#8211;dipole interactions, by using a strategy of electrolyte additive. The tertiary amine (N(CH2)3) and carboxyl (&#9472;COO&#8722;) groups in the deprotonated BHEG can reversibly capture H+ and dynamically neutralize OH&#8722; ions, efficiently buffering the interfacial pH of Zn metal anodes and suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions. Additionally, the BHEG adsorption layers can repel 39.3% of H2O molecules at the Zn interface, creating a &#8220;water&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane and preventing Zn corrosion. Significantly, the N(CH2)3 groups in BHEG also inhibit polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, which exhibits high adsorption energies of &#8722;0.88, &#8722;0.41, and &#8722;0.39&#160;eV for I&#8722;, I2, and I3&#8722;, respectively. Attributing to these benefits, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery can achieve a high areal capacity of 2.99 mAh cm&#8722;2 and an extended cycling life of 2,000 cycles, even at a high mass loading of I2 cathode (&#8776;21.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2).

         <title>Multi&#8208;Compatible, Self&#8208;Healing, and Temperature&#8208;Responsive Organohydrogels by Sub&#8208;Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;nanowires organohydrogels featuring a dual&#8208;phase structure are fabricated through the simple mixing of hydroxyapatite sub&#8208;nanowires with organic solvent and aqueous phase, directly forming a stable water&#8208;in&#8208;oil structure. The organohydrogels inherently possess rapid self&#8208;healing ability, exhibit specific temperature&#8208;responsive behavior, and are broadly compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers.








Abstract
Organohydrogels have significant applications in numerous fields.

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia by Superionic Conductor with Mixed Ion/Electron Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) with enhanced mixed electronic/ionic conductivity is applied for solar&#8208;driven nitrate conversion to ammonia. The migration of mobile lithium ions between layers significantly promotes the electronic conductivity of FePS2.66Li0.87 SIC, which achieves a remarkable ammonia synthesis yield (134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) under low bias voltage.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) nitrate reduction shows substantial potential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (NH3) conversion. However, low electron density and disordered electron conduction of conventional catalysts result in limited performance and low Faraday efficiency. Herein, a FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) is developed by introducing lithium ions into van der Waals immobile layered of FePS3 catalyst. This layered crystal framework facilitates high&#8208;concentration lithium ions confinement and long&#8208;range diffusion at room temperature, transitioning the conduction mechanism from electronic to mixed ionic/electronic. The typical nanofluidic ion transport leads to a high ionic conductivity of 16.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and enhanced electronic conductivity of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, mobile lithium ions within interlayers enhance the interaction between the low&#8208;lying 3dyz orbitals of Fe interacting with 2a2 empty antibonding orbitals of NO3&#8722;. An excellent PEC ammonia production of 134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 with 96.95% Faradaic efficiency is achieved, and the corresponding solar&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 efficiency of 57.13% offers a promising pathway toward sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Nose&#8208;to&#8208;Brain Delivery of Circular RNA SCMH1&#8208;Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and safe circular&#8208;RNA delivery system circSCMH1@LNP1 is developed for direct nose&#8208;to&#8208;brain delivery of circRNA SCMH1 to ischemic lesions. Experiments demonstrate that intranasally administrated circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly accumulates in the peri&#8208;infarct region of PT stroke mice, thereby improving functional recovery by enhancing synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke represents one of the leading cerebrovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality and disability globally. To date, there are no effective clinical drugs available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes for post&#8208;stroke patients. A novel nucleic acid agent circSCMH1 which can promote sensorimotor function recovery in rodent and nonhuman primate animal stroke models has been found. However, there are still delivery challenges to overcome for its clinical implementation. Besides, its effects on post&#8208;stroke cognitive functions remain unexplored. Herein, lipid nanoparticle circSCMH1@LNP1 is established to deliver circSCMH1 and explore its therapeutic efficacy comprehensively. Distribution experiments demonstrate that intranasal administration of circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly increases circSCMH1 distribution in the peri&#8208;infarct region and reduces its non&#8208;specific accumulation in other organs compared to intravenous injection. Therapeutic results indicate that circSCMH1@LNP1 promotes synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation, thereby achieving enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive function recovery in post&#8208;stroke mice. In conclusion, this research presents a simple and effective LNP system for efficient delivery of circSCMH1 via intranasal administration to repair post&#8208;stroke brain injury. It is envisioned that this study may bridge a crucial gap between basic research and translational application, paving the way for clinical implementation of novel circSCMH1 in post&#8208;stroke patient management.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating the Local Conjugation of Tertiary Aniline toward Highly Stable Polymer Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;electrochemically compatible polymer electrolyte is proposed with a locally conjugated structure through self&#8208;regulation of paired tertiary anilines coupled with in situ polymerization, which significantly reconstructs an improved Li+ solvation and enhances electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability of LMBs. This concept provides an important theoretical basis and technical means for achieving practical high energy/power density LMBs.








Abstract
Pursuing high energy/power density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with good safety and lifespan is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable degradation of the electrolyte and the subsequent formation of inferior electrolyte/electrode interfaces present formidable challenges to this endeavor, especially when paring with transition metal oxide cathode. Herein, a fireproof polymeric matrix with a local conjugated structure is constructed by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N, N&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (NDA) monomer via in situ polymerization, which promotes the use of ester&#8208;based liquid electrolyte for highly stable LMBs. The conjugated tertiary anilines in this PNDA electrolyte effectively tune the Li+ solvation sheath and generate conformal protective layers on the electrode surfaces, resulting in excellent compatibility with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li&#8208;metal anodes. Moreover, the accumulated electron density endows PNDA with a powerful capability to seize and eliminate the corrosive hydrofluoric acid, which strikingly mitigates the irreversible structure transformation of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC) particles. As a result, the PNDA&#8208;based Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NMC cells reach excellent electrochemical and safety performance. This study provides a promising strategy for the macromolecular design of electrolytes and emphasizes the importance of &#8220;local conjugation&#8221; within the polymers for LMBs.

         <title>A Strain Relaxation Modulation for Printing High&#8208;performance Flexible Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of flexible organic solar cells. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. Thus, these provide the potential for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of robust and flexible organic solar cells (F&#8208;OSCs), which are always influenced by mechanical strain and thermodynamic relaxation within the films. Nevertheless, the potential determinants of these properties and quantitative metrics modulating the overall performance of flexible devices have not been thoroughly defined. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, the secondary thermal relaxation of side chains in polyethylene oxide (PEO) local motion restricts the free fluctuation volume through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. These contribute to an increase in yield strength and a reduction in microcracks while enhancing the fracture energy at the donor/acceptor interface. Finally, the optimal F&#8208;OSCs demonstrate champion PCEs of 19.12% (0.04 cm2) and 16.92% (1.00 cm2), and maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after heating at 85 &#176;C for 2600&#160;h. Besides, the flexibility and mechanical robustness of devices are also optimized, the elastic modulus and stiffness are decreased by 50.68% and 5.71%.

Herein, a fine-grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small-molecule acceptor films, thereby suppressing the non-ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual-enriched state.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of robust and flexible organic solar cells (F-OSCs), which are always influenced by mechanical strain and thermodynamic relaxation within the films. Nevertheless, the potential determinants of these properties and quantitative metrics modulating the overall performance of flexible devices have not been thoroughly defined. Herein, a fine-grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small-molecule acceptor films, the secondary thermal relaxation of side chains in polyethylene oxide (PEO) local motion restricts the free fluctuation volume through hydrogen-bonding interactions, thereby suppressing the non-ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual-enriched state. These contribute to an increase in yield strength and a reduction in microcracks while enhancing the fracture energy at the donor/acceptor interface. Finally, the optimal F-OSCs demonstrate champion PCEs of 19.12% (0.04 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and 16.92% (1.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after heating at 85 &#176;C for 2600&#160;h. Besides, the flexibility and mechanical robustness of devices are also optimized, the elastic modulus and stiffness are decreased by 50.68% and 5.71%. This work provides interesting references for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in flexible organic photovoltaics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Porous Polyamide&#8208;Imide Membrane for Switchable Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amphiphilic polymer Torlon&#8208;based membrane with switchable superwettability is developed using a simple one&#8208;step phase separation method. Its hierarchical porous structure and surface reorganization enable exceptional oil&#8208;water separation with ultrahigh permeance and efficiency. The membrane exhibits excellent antifouling, self&#8208;cleaning, and durability, offering a scalable solution for advanced oily wastewater treatment and beyond.








Abstract
The development of advanced membranes with switchable superwettability has attracted considerable attention for the efficient treatment of oily wastewater. However, challenges persist in designing and fabricating such membranes through straightforward methods. In this study, a novel strategy is presented to design switchable superwettable membranes based on micro/nano&#8208;structured porous surfaces and surface chemical composition reorganization. A commercial amphiphilic polymer, polyamide&#8208;imide (Torlon), is fabricated into a porous symmetric membrane with a hierarchical surface structure using a one&#8208;step non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation method. By leveraging the surface reorganization capability of amphiphilic polymers and the hierarchically porous structure, the resulting membranes demonstrate exceptional superamphiphilicity in air, underwater superoleophobicity, and underoil superhydrophobicity. These properties enable ultrahigh permeance and separation efficiency for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil, and crude oil/water emulsions through a gravity&#8208;driven process, eliminating the need for external energy. Furthermore, the membranes exhibit excellent antifouling and self&#8208;cleaning performance, maintaining stable operation over multiple cycles. This work provides an innovative and scalable approach to next&#8208;generation switchable superwettable membranes with broad potential applications in oily wastewater treatment and beyond.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Compatible Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Design Enabling Lithium Metal Batteries Operation at 4.8&#160;V with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduce a novel approach to enhancing cathode&#8208;SPE compatibility by utilizing the same poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material in both the SPE and the cathode binder. A modified biomass&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with highly negatively charged C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is incorporated into the SPE to improve Li+ migration and strengthen its mechanical properties. The Li||LiFePO&#8324; cell, assembled via in situ photopolymerization, demonstrate stable cycling for over 1100 cycles, while the Li||NCM811 cell operated reliably at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8 V for 100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer higher energy density and enhance safety compared to the Li&#8208;ion batteries that use a graphite anode and organic electrolytes. However, achieving long cycle life for LMBs while enabling the use of high&#8208;voltage cathodes required the compatibility between cathode&#8208;SPE, rather than focusing solely on the individual components. This study presente a dual&#8208;functional poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material that simultaneously serves as an SPE matrix and a cathode binder, constructing a cathode&#8208;SPE interface with exceptional (electro)chemical compatibility owing to the high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. Additionally, a modified cellulose acetate (CA)&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is designed rationally and incorporated to assist the Li+ migration, leveraging their highly negative charge, and enhancing the mechanical strength of the SPE. Furthermore, an in situ polymerization approach is employed to assemble the cells, improving the physical compatibility at the cathode&#8208;SPE interface. As a result, the Li||LFP cell demonstrate stable cycling beyond 1100 cycles, and the Li||NCM811 cell reliably operates at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 4.8&#160;V.

         <title>2D Rhodium&#8208;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>

         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;carbon coordination&#8208;based 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks are rationally synthesized and exhibit ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.10&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) and intrinsic charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 via time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are emerging organic van der Waals materials with great potential in various applications owing to their structural diversity, and tunable optoelectronic properties. So far, most reported 2D MOFs rely on metal&#8208;heteroatom coordination (e.g., metal&#8211;nitrogen, metal&#8211;oxygen, and metal&#8211;sulfur); synthesis of metal&#8208;carbon coordination based 2D MOFs remains a formidable challenge. This study reports the rhodium&#8211;carbon (Rh&#8211;C) coordination&#8208;based 2D MOFs, using isocyanide as the ligand and Rh(I) as metal node. The synthesized MOFs show excellent crystallinity with quasi&#8208;square lattice networks. These MOFs show ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.1&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) resulting from the interaction between Rh(I) and isocyano groups. Terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates exceptional short&#8208;range charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 in the as&#8208;synthesized MOFs. Moreover, these MOFs are used as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction and show an excellent NH3 yield rate of 56.0 &#177;&#160;1.5&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a record Faradaic efficiency of 87.1 &#177;&#160;1.8%. In situ experiments reveal dual pathways involving Rh(I) during the catalytic process. This work represents a pioneering step toward 2D MOFs based on metal&#8211;carbon coordination and paves the way for novel reticular materials with ultra&#8208;high carrier mobility and for versatile optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Revealing the Coordination and Mediation Mechanism of Arylboronic Acids Toward Energy&#8208;Dense Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acids are explored for use in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries. The theoretically and experimentally verified coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids can not only stabilize the anode interface but also accelerate the sluggish sulfur conversion. 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) is chosen as a suitable electrolyte modifier, significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries offer a promising avenue for the next generation of energy&#8208;dense batteries. However, it is quite challenging to realize practical Li&#9472;S batteries under limited electrolytes and high sulfur loading, which may exacerbate problems of interface deterioration and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids that enable energy&#8208;dense and long&#8208;term&#8208;cycling Li&#9472;S batteries is proposed. The coordination chemistry between NO3&#8722; and arylboronic acids breaks the resonance configuration of NO3&#8722; and thermodynamically promotes its reduction on the anode, contributing to a mechanically robust interface. The mediation chemistry between lithium arylborate and polysulfides distorts S&#9472;S/Li&#9472;S bonds, alters the rate&#8208;determining step from Li2S4&#8594;Li2S2 to Li2S6&#8594;Li2S4, and homogeneously accelerates the sulfur redox kinetics. Li&#9472;S batteries using 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) show excellent cycling stability (1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle) and a high energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under aggressive chemical environments (high sulfur loading of 17.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte operation of 3.6&#160;mL gS&#8722;1).

     alt="Revealing the Coordination and Mediation Mechanism of Arylboronic Acids Toward Energy-Dense Li-S Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arylboronic acids are explored for use in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries. The theoretically and experimentally verified coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids can not only stabilize the anode interface but also accelerate the sluggish sulfur conversion. 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) is chosen as a suitable electrolyte modifier, significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries offer a promising avenue for the next generation of energy-dense batteries. However, it is quite challenging to realize practical Li&#9472;S batteries under limited electrolytes and high sulfur loading, which may exacerbate problems of interface deterioration and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids that enable energy-dense and long-term-cycling Li&#9472;S batteries is proposed. The coordination chemistry between NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and arylboronic acids breaks the resonance configuration of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and thermodynamically promotes its reduction on the anode, contributing to a mechanically robust interface. The mediation chemistry between lithium arylborate and polysulfides distorts S&#9472;S/Li&#9472;S bonds, alters the rate-determining step from Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;&#8594;Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and homogeneously accelerates the sulfur redox kinetics. Li&#9472;S batteries using 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) show excellent cycling stability (1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle) and a high energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under aggressive chemical environments (high sulfur loading of 17.4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and lean electrolyte operation of 3.6&#160;mL g&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). The basic mechanism of coordination and mediation chemistry can be extended to other arylboronic acids with different configurations and compositions, thus broadening the application prospect of arylboronic acids in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Natural Lignification Inspired Super&#8208;Hard Wood&#8208;Based Composites with Extreme Resilience</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) are designed and developed inspired by the mesoscale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth. This innovative hybrid structure is achieved by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression.








Abstract
The growing demand for high&#8208;strength, durable materials capable of enduring extreme environments presents a significant challenge, particularly in balancing performance with sustainability. Conventional materials such as alloys and ceramics are nonrenewable, expensive, and require energy&#8208;intensive production processes. Here, super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) inspired by the meso&#8208;scale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth are designed and developed. This hybrid structure is achieved innovatively by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable properties, including a Janka hardness of 24&#160;382&#160;N and a Brinell hardness of 40.7&#160;HB, along with exceptional antipiercing performance. The created super&#8208;hard, sustainable materials address the limitations of nonrenewable resources while providing enhanced protection, structural stability, and exceptional resilience. The WBC approach aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering extra values for improving personal safety and building integrity across various engineering applications.

         <title>Unlocking Multimodal Nonlinear Microscopy for Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging under Continuous&#8208;Wave Excitation with Tunable Upconverting Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a multimodal nonlinear microscopy approach using upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) under continuous&#8208;wave excitation. The UCNPs exhibit high&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses, enabling deep&#8208;tissue 3D imaging, video&#8208;rate wide&#8208;field imaging, and depth&#8208;selective photomodulation. High&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks is demonstrated, highlighting the potential for cost&#8208;effective bioimaging and targeted phototherapy applications.








Abstract
Nonlinear microscopy provides excellent depth penetration and axial sectioning for 3D imaging, yet widespread adoption is limited by reliance on expensive ultrafast pulsed lasers. This work circumvents such limitations by employing rare&#8208;earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), specifically Yb3+/Tm3+ co&#8208;doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, which exhibit strong multimodal nonlinear optical responses under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation. These UCNPs emit multiple wavelengths at UV (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), blue (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), and NIR (&#955; &#8776; 800 nm), whose intensities are nonlinearly governed by excitation power. Exploiting these properties, multi&#8208;colored nonlinear emissions enable functional imaging of cerebral blood vessels in deep brain. Using a simple optical setup, high resolution in vivo 3D imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks at depths up to 800 &#181;mm is achieved, surpassing performance of conventional imaging methods using CW lasers. In vivo cerebrovascular flow dynamics is also visualized with wide&#8208;field video&#8208;rate imaging under low&#8208;powered CW excitation. Furthermore, UCNPs enable depth&#8208;selective, 3D&#8208;localized photo&#8208;modulation through turbid media, presenting spatiotemporally targeted light beacons. This innovative approach, leveraging UCNPs' intrinsic nonlinear optical characteristics, significantly advances multimodal nonlinear microscopy with CW lasers, opening new opportunities in bio&#8208;imaging, remote optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Establishing Nanoscale Circuitry by Designing a Structure with Atomic Short&#8208;range Order for High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microsized perovskite oxide Ce0.266W0.1Nb0.9O3 is engineered as an anode material for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;life Li+ storage, demonstrating impressive performance by maintaining both high areal capacity and high rate capability, even at high mass loadings. This outstanding electrochemical behavior is primarily attributed to the nanoscale circuitry formed by an atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate materials necessitate the rapid transportation of both electrons and ions, a requirement that becomes especially challenging at practical mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm2). To address this challenge, a material is designed with an architecture having atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order. This design establishes internal nanoscale circuitry at the particle level, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transport within micrometer&#8208;sized niobium tungsten oxides. The architecture features alternating cerium&#8208;depleted and cerium&#8208;enriched regions. The continuous cerium&#8208;enriched regions with enhanced conductivity provide multilane highways for electron mobility by functioning as electron&#8208;conducting wires that significantly boost the overall conductivity. The cerium&#8208;depleted regions effectively mitigate electrostatic repulsion and promote rapid ion transport through ion&#8208;conducting channels. These structural characteristics provide a continuous network that supports both electrical migration and chemical diffusion to amplify the areal capacity and rate capability even at high mass loadings. These findings not only expand the fundamental understanding of the design of optimal host lattices for advanced energy storage systems but also of the practical application of microsized high&#8208;rate electrode materials.

         <title>Linear Dielectric Polymers with Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Crystals for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the pivotal role of ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals in boosting the high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage of polynorbornene dielectrics. This distinctive characteristic enables the polymers to exhibit an impressive high&#8208;temperature discharge energy density of 6.76 J cm&#8722;3, even under electric fields that are far below their Weibull breakdown strength.








Abstract
Achieving optimal capacitive energy storage performance necessitates the integration of high energy storage density, typical of ferroelectric dielectrics, with the low polarization loss associated with linear dielectrics. However, combining these characteristics in a single dielectric material is challenging due to the inherent contradictions between the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric dielectrics and the adaptability of linear dielectrics to changes in the electric field. To address this issue, a linear isotactic sulfonylated polynorbornene dielectric characterized by ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals has been developed. The sulfonyl dipoles in the ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals are oriented in the same direction, thereby enabling this polymer to exhibit a considerable dielectric constant (7.5) at room temperature. Notably, when the operating temperature surpasses the polymer's glass transition temperature (Tg &#8776; 140 &#176;C), its dielectric constant rises to 12 with just minor changes in the dissipation factor. At 150 &#176;C, 90% efficiency of the discharge energy density reaches as high as 6.76 J&#160;cm&#8722;1 under a low electric field of 320 MV m&#8722;1, which is ten times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, high&#8208;temperature, capacitor&#8208;grade polyetherimide.

     alt="Linear Dielectric Polymers with Ferroelectric-Like Crystals for High-Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study reveals the pivotal role of ferroelectric-like crystals in boosting the high-temperature capacitive energy storage of polynorbornene dielectrics. This distinctive characteristic enables the polymers to exhibit an impressive high-temperature discharge energy density of 6.76 J cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, even under electric fields that are far below their Weibull breakdown strength.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving optimal capacitive energy storage performance necessitates the integration of high energy storage density, typical of ferroelectric dielectrics, with the low polarization loss associated with linear dielectrics. However, combining these characteristics in a single dielectric material is challenging due to the inherent contradictions between the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric dielectrics and the adaptability of linear dielectrics to changes in the electric field. To address this issue, a linear isotactic sulfonylated polynorbornene dielectric characterized by ferroelectric-like crystals has been developed. The sulfonyl dipoles in the ferroelectric-like crystals are oriented in the same direction, thereby enabling this polymer to exhibit a considerable dielectric constant (7.5) at room temperature. Notably, when the operating temperature surpasses the polymer's glass transition temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; &#8776; 140 &#176;C), its dielectric constant rises to 12 with just minor changes in the dissipation factor. At 150 &#176;C, 90% efficiency of the discharge energy density reaches as high as 6.76 J&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a low electric field of 320 MV m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is ten times that of the state-of-the-art, high-temperature, capacitor-grade polyetherimide. The enhancement of high-temperature capacitive performance, achieved by utilizing the crystallinity of isotactic polymers to form a polar structure, presents a new perspective for the design of high-temperature dielectric polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>TREM2 scFv&#8208;Engineering Escherichia coli Displaying Modulation of Macrophages to Boost Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is designed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy.








Abstract
Preoperative neoadjuvant radio&#8208;chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, yet its effectiveness can be limited by the insensitivity of some patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Through preliminary research, it is found that TREM2+ macrophages play a pivotal role in the non&#8208;responsiveness to immunotherapy. To address this challenge, a novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is developed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy. The released anti&#8208;TREM2 scFv can be precisely targeted and delivered to the tumor site via the engineered EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor therapeutic efficiency when used in combination with the &#945;PD&#8208;L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, these engineered bacteria can be further modified to enhance the intestinal colonization capabilities through oral administration, thereby regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts. Consequently, the ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on the engineered bacteria not only introduces a promising new therapeutic option for low rectal cancer but also showcases the potential to finely tune immune responses within the intricate tumor microenvironment, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered Nanoparticles Induce Cuproptosis for Enhancing Immunogenic Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic polymers Poly RA and Poly MPN are self&#8208;assembled into biodegradable nanocarriers (RC NPs), which are evaluated for their antitumor performance in pancreatic cancer models. Upon accumulation at the tumor site, the RC NPs can be activated by ultrasound for SDT, generating ROS capable of killing cancer cells and promoting the release of Cu2+, which in turn induces cuproptosis and suppresses tumor progression. Notably, both processes are capable of inducing ICD and enhancing antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, as a novel mechanism of cell death, holds significant promise for tumor therapy. However, existing studies typically employ methods to induce cuproptosis through endogenous or exogenous pathways, which often fail to achieve precise control in both space and time. Herein, polymeric nanoparticles (RC NPs) are developed that enable precise activation of cuproptosis through acoustic control for tumor&#8208;specific treatment. The nanoparticles are fabricated via self&#8208;assembly of a degradable, acoustic&#8208;sensitive polymer (Poly RA) and a metal&#8208;ion&#8208;loadable polyphenol&#8208;structured polymer (Poly MPN). Ultrasound stimulation cleaved the RC NPs, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoting the release of copper ions from Poly MPN, leading to the aggregation of lipoylated proteins and depletion of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster proteins to introduce cuproptosis. Subsequently, the RC NPs successfully activated the immune system of mice, promoting the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells and the activation of T lymphocytes. The nanoparticles exhibited good biosafety and significant tumor inhibition in both orthotopic and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models. These novel nanoparticles provide a promising modality for the treatment of highly aggressive cancers and a valuable avenue for future clinical applications.

         <title>An Environmentally Responsive Molecular Engineering Framework for Subcellular Drug Translocalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome lysosomal barriers, an OVDS framework is provided features a fluorescence visualization unit, a drug&#8208;loading unit, and a mitochondria localization unit to switch HCPT from the lysosomal&#8208;to&#8208;mitochondrial localization, achieving targeted subcellular drug distribution and fundamentally solving the technical problem of tumor drug resistance, offering a promising tool for overcoming lysosome&#8208;mediated drug resistance in clinical oncology.








Abstract
The power of drugs lies in their ability to reach their target sites and remain in place for a sufficient duration to exert their therapeutic effects. However, for some drugs, lysosomal phagocytosis presents ongoing challenges. In this study, an engineered organelles visualization drug&#8208;delivery system (OVDS) is introduced as a subcellular drug visualization and redistribution framework that facilitates the movement of drug molecules from one organelle, specifically lysosomes, to another, such as the mitochondria. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, an OVDS is developed to facilitate the translocation of 10&#8208;hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) from the lysosomes to mitochondria. This modification of subcellular HCPT distribution allows the evasion of lysosome&#8208;mediated HCPT resistance in cancer cells. Unlike traditional chemotherapeutic approaches, when HCPT is incorporated into the OVDS framework (HCPT&#8208;OVDS), the positive charge of the OVDS facilitates protonation, thereby enabling HCPT to escape lysosomes and enter mitochondria. Using HCPT&#8208;OVDS, substantial drug accumulation is achieved at the target sites in HCPT&#8208;resistant cells, with up to 70 &#177; 6% efficient subcellular translocalization and a 12.8 fold enhancement in cytotoxicity. Overall, the HCPT&#8208;OVDS represents an innovative engineering framework for subcellular spatial redistribution and offers a promising solution for addressing cancer drug resistance.

         <title>Highly Efficient Narrowband Circularly Polarized Luminescence from Discrete Supramolecular Aggregates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a discrete supramolecular dimerization strategy for achieving efficient chiral multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters featuring aggregation&#8208;induced circularly polarized luminescence enhancement. The resulting electroluminescence devices achieve narrowband emission with full width at half maximum down to 26 nm and a record&#8208;breaking figure of merit (|gEL| &#215; EQE) of 4.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Achieving narrowband emission, high efficiency, and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a significant challenge. In this study, a discrete supramolecular dimerization strategy is presented to overcome this limitation. By incorporating a helical arylamine with a sterically demanding configuration into a multi&#8208;resonance narrowband emitter, the formation of a unique dimeric structure in the solid state is enabled. Unlike conventional multi&#8208;resonance emitters prone to aggregation&#8208;caused quenching and continuous stacking, the CPL emitters form discrete, well&#8208;separated dimers. This distinct supramolecular arrangement not only preserves high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrowband emission but also amplifies CPL signals by optimizing intermolecular electronic coupling. OLEDs incorporating these enantiomers at a 10&#160;wt.% doping level exhibit outstanding performances, including a narrow full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 30&#160;nm, maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of 33.5% and 32.4%, and impressive electroluminescence dissymmetry factors (gEL) of +8.7 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and &#8722;9.1 &#215; 10&#8722;3, respectively. Remarkably, increasing the doping concentration to 20&#160;wt.% further boosts the gEL values to +1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;2 and &#8722;1.8 &#215; 10&#8722;2. This enhancement leads to Figures of Merit (EQE &#215; |gEL|) of 3.71 &#215; 10&#8722;3 and 4.12 &#215; 10&#8722;3, among the highest values for CPL devices.

         <title>Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Peroxide Over a Super&#8208;Aerophilic Graphite Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design of super&#8208;aerophilic graphite catalyst capable of trapping in situ produced oxygen gas on its surface under the electrolyte environment. By so doing, it is able to moderate intermediate species&#160;binding, which is critical to enabling the two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction to hydrogen peroxide.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron water oxidation reaction (2e&#8208;WOR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an attractive anode reaction with several merits. It can be paired with several large&#8208;scale cathode reactions that produce valuable chemical substances in an electrochemical cell. However, high&#8208;performing and reliable 2e&#8208;WOR anodic catalysts are yet to be fully developed. In this work, a rationally designed, inexpensive, robust, and selective graphite catalyst electrode is presented, made by following the key principle mechanisms of 2e&#8208;WOR. First, an aerophilic graphite&#8208;based electrode is created to leverage the challenges posed by the four&#8208;electron WOR, where&#160;the generated O2 from this reaction is kept onto the electrode surface to shift the O intermediates binding on graphite in the direction of improved H2O2 generation. An initial improvement in H2O2 selectivity of seven fold is observed, albeit with no improved H2O2 generation rates. The stunted H2O2 generation is ascribed to poor activity from pristine graphite, courtesy of less active sites and low intrinsic O2 binding in the electrolyte environment. Second, to improve and balance graphite's activity and selectivity, the structure of graphite is altered via different elemental doping (with N, S, B, and P atoms), a method that allows the retention of the O2 on the graphite surface. The super&#8208;aerophilic B&#8208;doped graphite catalyst (optimum) reaches a maximum Faraday efficiency (FE) of 60.6 &#177; 2.6% with a production rate of 26.7 &#177; 0.6 &#181;mol min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (85.9 &#177; 2.2 mA cm&#8722;2 partial current density) and excellent stability of over 120 h. In tandem, cathodic H2 co&#8208;production is demonstrated with an FE of above 90%. This approach demonstrates a rational approach to designing inexpensive and robust 2e&#8208;WOR anode catalysts for H2O2 and the possibility of its use in chemical co&#8208;production at the cathode.

         <title>Thermoelectric Field Enhanced Sulfur Evolution Kinetics for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/carbon nanotubes (BST/CNT) interlayer is designed to enhance the durability of Li&#8208;S batteries by providing extensive adsorption sites and generating a thermoelectric field from the BST thermoelectric material. This research not only demonstrates the effectiveness of the thermoelectric field in enhancing the conversion kinetics of LiPSs but also reveals its potential to boost the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
The practical deployment of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries has been impeded by the shuttle effect and sluggish kinetics of lithium polysulfide (LiPSs) conversion. Here, Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3/carbon nanotubes (BST/CNT) interlayer is designed to enhance the durability of Li&#8208;S batteries by providing extensive adsorption sites and generating a thermoelectric field from BST thermoelectric material. Experimental and density functional theory investigations confirm the superior adsorption properties of BST. Additionally, analyses using Gibbs free energy and cyclic voltammetry robustly demonstrate that the thermoelectric field significantly accelerates the conversion kinetics of LiPSs. The electrochemical performance of cells equipped with a 20% BST interlayer is exceptional, showing remarkable stability over 500 cycles at 1 C with a minimal capacity decay rate of 0.05% per cycle. Most importantly, the thermoelectric field substantially improves the conversion kinetics of LiPSs, allowing the cell to maintain a discharge capacity of 594 mAh g&#8722;1 even at 10 C. Furthermore, under conditions of high sulfur loading (7.0 mg cm&#8722;2) and low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio (6.1 &#181;L mg&#8722;1), the cell achieves an areal capacity of 5.9 mAh cm&#8722;2. This research not only evidences the effectiveness of the thermoelectric field in enhancing the conversion kinetics of LiPSs but also shows its potential to boost the performance of Li&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Steric Hindrance&#8208;Induced Amorphous Lithium Sulfide Deposition Accelerates Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strong coordination between benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 and Li+ generates the steric hindrance effect, successfully enabling the amorphous deposition of lithium sulfide (Li2S). This approach restructures the energy level distribution of Li2S, synchronously optimizing its molecular orbital energies and inducing uniform nucleation and growth. Consequently, it significantly reduces the kinetic barriers along the Li2S deposition pathway.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation energy storage due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density. However, their practical application is severely hindered by the sluggish conversion kinetics, particularly during the crystalline lithium sulfide (Li2S) formation stage. Herein, a steric hindrance&#8208;mediated engineering strategy is proposed that induces an amorphous Li2S deposition process, effectively boosting the sulfur redox kinetics in Li&#9472;S batteries. By introducing benzo&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5 (B15C5) as an electrolyte additive, a strong coordination between B15C5 and lithium ion (Li+) is established, which creates spatial confinement around Li2S and disrupts the crystallinity of Li2S during its deposition. Synchrotron pair distribution function analysis combined with in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that the deposited Li2S with B15C5 exhibits significant local disorder with irregular Li&#9472;S bond oscillations, confirming the generation of an amorphous phase. This strategy not only ensures a uniform Li2S layer at the cathode/electrolyte interface but also lowers the energy barrier of sulfur species at the molecular scale, enabling the Li&#9472;S batteries with excellent cycling stability and overall enhanced sulfur reaction kinetics. This work provides a novel pathway for overcoming the intrinsic limitations of sluggish cathode conversion kinetics of Li&#9472;S batteries, paving the way for their practical deployment in high&#8208;performance energy storage applications.

         <title>Friction Tuning of Interlayer Exciton Recombination in Van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is revealed how friction alters exciton dynamics in MoS&#8322;/WS&#8322; heterostructures. Using time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence combined with atomic force microscope, it is shown that friction&#8208;induced defects shorten interlayer exciton lifetimes by trapping electrons, which increases friction by affecting charge density evolution in turn. Density functional theory calculations confirm this mechanism, offering new insight into energy dissipation in nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical systems.








Abstract
Van der Waals heterostructures combine low friction with excellent optoelectronic properties, making them suitable for opto&#8208;nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the long lifetime of interlayer excitons in these materials helps reduce energy loss, friction in mechanical systems is unavoidable and can shorten the exciton recombination lifetime, undermining the low&#8208;friction benefits. Despite its importance, the fundamental mechanism underlying friction&#8208;induced changes in exciton recombination remains unexplored, mainly due to the difficulty of probing long&#8208;lifetime exciton recombination at friction interfaces. Here, time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence combined with an atomic force microscope is used to detect exciton recombination at the friction interface of MoS2/WS2 heterostructures. The findings show that friction generates defects, which trap electrons and create additional recombination pathways, shortening exciton recombination lifetimes. This, in turn, increases friction by altering charge density evolution and raising the friction sliding barrier. Density functional theory calculations confirm this mechanism. These results reveal how friction influences exciton recombination, paving the way for advancements in low&#8208;friction nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electromechanical devices.

This work reports Rec. 2020 compliant pure&#8208;green mixed&#8208;cation perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes, presenting a champion EQE of 31.89%, average EQE of 29.5%, maximum luminance of 2 &#215; 105 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and half&#8208;lifetime of &#8776;3500 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The results are enabled by synergistic co&#8208;additives, which can manipulate nanograin crystallization and mitigate crystal defects effectively.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) compliant with Rec. 2020 standards have raised increasing attention for next&#8208;generation displays. As a class of pure&#8208;green emitters, the mixed&#8208;cation FAxCs1&#8208;xPbBr3 perovskites exhibit compatible band emission, but suffer from inferior luminescence performance. The approach to tackling this issue is hindered by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of their crystallization manipulating mechanism. This work unveils the crystallization process of mixed&#8208;cation FA0.7Cs0.45GA0.1PbBr3 perovskites, demonstrating the fast spontaneous growth readily induces severe crystal defects accompanied by poor charge confinement. This motivates us to introduce additional kinetic barriers to manipulate the perovskite crystallization via the synergistic co&#8208;additives of 3&#8208;((2&#8208;(methacryloyloxy)ethyldimethyl)ammonio)&#8208;propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonate (DMAPS) and 1,4,7,10,13,16&#8208;hexaoxacyclooctadecane (crown). The multifunctional groups in the co&#8208;additives afford robust chemical affinities with the diverse organic and inorganic precursor ions simultaneously, which enable decent nanograin growth with effective crystal defect healing and charge confinement. Ultimately, mixed&#8208;cation FA0.7Cs0.45GA0.1PbBr3 perovskites with a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 96% are achieved. The resultant pure&#8208;green PeLEDs with the Rec. 2020 compliance exhibit a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.89%, average EQE of 29.5%, maximum luminance of 2 &#215; 105 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and operational half&#8208;lifetime of 3.2 h at an initial luminance of 7000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 (extrapolated: &#8776;3500 h at 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2).

         <title>Fluoroethylene Carbonate&#8208;Enabled Gel Polymer Electrolyte for Stable High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The triangular synergistic strategy employed in the designed hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE) enhances Li+&#160;transport in FEC, inhibits electrolyte oxidation and decomposition on the NCM811 cathode, and facilitates the formation of a LiDFOB&#8208;derived mixed cathode&#8211;electrolyte interphase (CEI) layer at the interface, thereby enabling stable cycling of Li||NCM811 quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells for 400 cycles at 4.5 V.








Abstract
The stable operation of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) at high voltages is currently limited by&#160;the performance of conventional electrolytes. Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) exhibits unique physicochemical properties that positively impact interfacial chemistry, positioning it as a promising candidate to enhance the performance of LMBs. However, FEC is prone to the formation of corrosive HF under high voltage, which leads to the degradation of&#160;electrode interface. In this study, a hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE) based on pure FEC solvent with pentafluorophenyl methacrylate (PFPMA) monomer is presented to extend the voltage operating range. The PFPMA monomer forms a mixed&#8208;layer solid electrolyte interphase with lithium difluoro(oxalato)borate (LiDFOB) on electrode surface, effectively inhibiting the decomposition of FEC. The triangular synergistic strategy involving FEC, PFPMA, and polymer segments improves the transport of&#160;Li ions&#160;in FEC, achieving&#160;a high Li+&#160;transference number of 0.87. The designed electrolyte demonstrates good compatibility with Li metal and stabilizes&#160;LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;(NCM811) cathodes. As&#160;a result, the Li||NCM811 battery based&#160;HGPE exhibits a capacity retention of 83.4% after 300 cycles and 74.2% after 400 cycles, under a cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.5&#160;V. This study provides a promising strategy for the development of GPE for high&#8208;voltage LMBs applications.

         <title>Functionally Segregated Ion Regulation Enables Dual Confinement Effect for Highly Stable Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionally segregated ion regulation strategy is developed, incorporating ion&#8208;functional groups into the hydrogel electrolyte to achieve a dual confinement effect and regulate Zn2+ flux. This approach effectively suppresses the polyiodide shuttle effect and strengthens the electrochemical stability of Zn anodes, enabling aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries with high areal capacity and a record&#8208;long lifespan.








Abstract
Conventional electrolytes in aqueous zinc&#8208;iodine batteries struggle to suppress the shuttle effect and enhance interfacial stability, resulting in high self&#8208;discharge rate, low areal capacity, and short cycle life. To address these issues, a dual&#8208;confinement hydrogel electrolyte (DCHE) is designed to simultaneously stabilize the iodine cathode and zinc anode at high areal capacities via a functionally segregated ion regulation strategy. As for the cathode, anion&#8208;functional groups in the DCHE repel polyiodides, while cation&#8208;functional groups adsorb those that escape repulsion, thereby reinforcing the suppression of polyiodide migration toward the zinc anode. This dual confinement effect, validated by theoretical simulations and in situ characterization, effectively mitigates the shuttle effect. Additionally, hydrophilic and zincophilic functional groups regulate the hydrogen&#8208;bond network and Zn2+ flux, strengthening the electrochemical stability of the zinc anode. As a result, a Zn//ZnI2 cell assembled with DCHE delivers a practical areal capacity of 4.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and achieves a record&#8208;long lifespan exceeding 6000&#160;h with 88.9% capacity retention at 100&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1. Furthermore, the single&#8208;layer pouch cell exhibits good mechanical stability, retaining 80% of its capacity after 100 cycles of 90&#176; bending. This work highlights the importance of functionally segregated ion regulation in advancing high&#8208;performance aqueous batteries.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fine 3D Bioprinting of Dynamic Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogel for in Vitro Modeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D bioprinting merges tissue engineering and additive manufacturing to create biological structures. A bioink is developed by modifying hyaluronic acid, a natural extracellular matrix polymer, with cysteine. Potassium iodide is later added to tune gelation kinetics, enabling fine printing with a 32G needle. This innovation supports precise 3D in vitro models for studying cell interactions, disease mechanisms, and advancing therapeutics.









Abstract
3D bioprinting bridges tissue engineering and additive manufacturing, however developing bioinks with balanced biological and physical properties remains a challenge. Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a promising base material due to its biocompatibility and cell&#8208;recognition features. An HA&#8208;based bioink is designed using dynamic disulfide&#8208;crosslinking at physiological pH by modifying HA with cysteine moieties. To overcome the slow gelation kinetics typical of disulfide&#8208;crosslinked hydrogels, potassium iodide (KI) is introduced, accelerating gelation in a concentration&#8208;dependent manner. KI not only enhances gelation but also provides radical scavenging properties while maintaining hydrogel integrity. A low KI concentration (50&#160;mm) offers more than a 3&#160;h printing window, ensures cell viability, and facilitates the use of fine needles (32G, 108&#160;&#181;m inner diameter). This enables the fabrication of large (&gt;3&#160;cm) and complex 3D structures. Using this bioink, an osteoarthritis disease model is developed to investigate interactions between human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) and chondrocytes, demonstrating the immunomodulatory effect of hMSCs on inflammation&#8208;induced chondrocytes. Overall, the HA&#8208;based bioink addresses critical challenges in 3D bioprinting, providing a robust platform for constructing innovative in vitro models and supporting advancements in disease modeling and precision medicine.

         <title>Neuromorphic Light&#8208;Responsive Organic Matter for in Materia Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work we show that light&#8208;responsive adaptive organic matter can store and process information at the matter level, and emulate neuromorphic functionalities such as short term memory, long term memory and visual memory. Besides demonstrating that material dynamics can be exploited for spatio&#8208;temporal event detection and motion perception, we show that these adaptive photo&#8208;responsive organic systems can be exploited for hardware implementation of physical reservoir computing.








Abstract
Materials able to sense and respond to external stimuli by adapting their internal state to process and store information, represent promising candidates for implementing neuromorphic functionalities and brain&#8208;inspired computing paradigms. In this context, neuromorphic systems based on light&#8208;responsive materials enable the use of light as information carrier, allowing to emulate basic functions of the human retina. In this work it is demonstrated that optically&#8208;induced molecular dynamics in azopolymers can be exploited for neuromorphic&#8208;type of data processing in the analog domain and for computing at the matter level (i.e., in materia). Besides showing that azopolymers can be exploited for data storage, it is demonstrated that the adaptiveness of these materials enables the implementation of synaptic functionalities including short&#8208;term memory, long&#8208;term memory, and visual memory. Results show that azopolymers allow event detection and motion perception, enabling physical implementation of information processing schemes requiring real&#8208;time analysis of spatio&#8208;temporal inputs. Furthermore, it is shown that light&#8208;induced dynamics can be exploited for the in materia implementation of the unconventional computing paradigm denoted as reservoir computing. This work underscores the potential of azopolymers as promising materials for developing adaptive, intelligent photo&#8208;responsive systems that mimic some of the complex processing abilities of biological systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ocular Delivery of Brain&#8208;Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Oligomycin for Neuroprotection in Glaucoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional gene&#8211;drug co&#8208;delivery nanoplatform targeting M&#252;ller cells is developed to safeguard retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and restore optic nerve function in glaucoma. Multifunctional PPOB nanoparticles achieve high&#8208;efficiency (64.26%) and sustained (14.5 days) gene expression of BDNF. Combined with oligomycin, they effectively inhibit &#160;the apoptosis of RGCs and confer superior optic nerve protection in an 8&#8208;week treatment.








Abstract
Glaucoma is a retinal neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and irreversible visual impairment. Current therapies rarely offer direct&#160;protection for RGCs, highlighting the need for new neuroprotective approaches. Although viral delivery of brain&#8208;derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has shown potential, concerns about retinal inflammation and limited applicability persist. Meanwhile, non&#8208;viral vectors remain inefficient for in vivo ocular gene delivery. Here, a highly biocompatible nanoplatform&#8212;PBAE&#8208;PLGA&#8208;Oligomycin&#8208;pBDNF nanoparticles (PPOB NPs) is reported&#8212;that co&#8208;delivers oligomycin (an ATP inhibitor) and a BDNF plasmid to M&#252;ller cells in vivo. This nanoplatform attains an unprecedented transfection efficiency of 64.26% in M&#252;ller cells, thereby overcoming the limitations of monotherapeutic neurotrophic approaches that fail to inhibit ATP overproduction and attendant inflammatory responses. In a chronic ocular hypertension rat model, oligomycin effectively mitigated RGC damage by suppressing M&#252;ller cell&#160;hyperactivation and excessive ATP production under elevated intraocular pressure. Concurrently, it synergistically enhanced BDNF expression in M&#252;ller cells, achieving robust protection of RGCs and preservation of optic nerve function. These findings underscore the promise of PPOB NPs as a dual&#8208;functional platform, featuring high biocompatibility and efficient gene delivery, for multifaceted therapies against glaucoma and other ocular diseases.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Melt&#8208;Processable Polymer Semiconductors with Large&#8208;Ring Crown Ether Side Chains for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;ring crown ether side chain is introduced to conjugated polymers to enable low&#8208;temperature melt processing while retaining high charge transport performance. The resulting polymers form highly aligned films via melt friction transfer, achieving enhanced mobility in organic transistors. This ecofriendly strategy supports scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance polymer electronics with reduced solvent reliance.








Abstract
Polymer semiconductors are crucial components in organic electronics and have shown remarkable progress in recent years. However, their dependence on halogenated solvents for film processing raises environmental concerns and introduces risks of defects caused by residual solvent molecules during film drying. Melt processing has emerged as a sustainable alternative for fabricating polymer semiconductor films. Despite its potential, balancing low melting temperatures with high charge transport performance remains challenging, as high&#8208;performance polymers typically exhibit high melting points due to their rigid conjugated backbones. This study introduces a molecular design strategy incorporating large&#8208;ring crown ether (LCE) side chains to enhance the melt processability of conjugated polymers. This approach reduces the melt temperature to as low as 70 &#176;C while maintaining excellent charge transport performance. Highly aligned polymer films are fabricated using melt friction transfer processing and employed in organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs), achieving a carrier mobility of up to 1.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the channel&#8208;parallel direction, approximately 2.5 times greater than their non&#8208;oriented counterparts. Aggregation structure characterizations reveal that these LCE side chains not only enable low melting temperature but also facilitate bimodal texture formation, creating 3D pathways for efficient charge transport. This strategy offers a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly approach to produce high&#8208;performance electronics.

         <title>Effects of Interfacial Adhesion on Lithium Plating Location in Solid&#8208;State Batteries with Carbon Interlayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon interlayers can promote the stable cycling of anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state batteries, but their underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. In this study, a direct correlation is observed between the interfacial adhesion of the carbon interlayer and the location of lithium plating. By conducting quantitative peel tests, a threshold interfacial toughness is found to be a determining factor that directs plating toward specific interfaces.








Abstract
Carbon interlayers have been implemented in &#8220;anode&#8208;free&#8221; solid&#8208;state batteries to improve the uniformity and reversibility of lithium deposition by controlling the location of Li plating. However, there remains a lack of fundamental understanding of the detailed role of how these interlayers function during in situ Li formation. In this study, the relationships between the interfacial adhesion of the carbon interlayer to the solid electrolyte and the location of Li plating are investigated. By varying the lamination pressure used during manufacturing, the ability to systematically tune the resulting interfacial adhesion is demonstrated. Mechanical peel tests are performed, and a 4&#8208;fold increase in interfacial toughness is measured as the lamination pressure increases from 100 to 400&#160;MPa. Post&#8208;mortem electron microscopy revealed that the location of Li plating with respect to the carbon interlayer transitions from the interface with the solid electrolyte to the current collector above a threshold interfacial toughness, which is consistent when the interlayer material is changed from amorphous to hard carbon. These findings highlight the role of electro&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical relationships in systematically controlling Li deposition in solid&#8208;state batteries when interlayers are present.

         <title>Redox Oscillation Enhanced Water&#8208;Enabled Electric Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the membrane potential variations and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water&#8208;enabled electric generator is proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface but also realizes the synergy between the non&#8208;Faraday and Faraday current. The generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.41 W m&#8722;2 for 60 days.








Abstract
The energy crisis driven by the widespread use of fossil fuels highlights the urgent need for green energy solutions. A variety of green electric generators based on interfacial ion regulation have emerged in recent years. However, conventional electricity generation methods that rely solely on ion movement at interfaces suffer from a rapid decline in electrical signals due to poor ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface. Inspired by the bioelectrical phenomena based on the variations in membrane potential and the glucose oxidation/reduction reactions, a redox oscillation enhanced water&#8208;enabled electric generator is herein proposed. The oscillating redox process not only boosts the ion&#8208;electron conversion at the interface but also enables the synergy between the non&#8208;Faraday current and the Faraday current. As a result, the generator achieves an impressive peak electric output of 1.20 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.41 W m&#8722;2 for 60 days, outperforming various water&#8208;enabled electric generators. Furthermore, this generator can be integrated into a flexible unit for both portable and large&#8208;scale applications. This work presents a novel approach for enhancing the output of green energy devices based on interfacial ion migration.

         <title>Nonlinear Metasurfaces for Completed Control of Amplitude, Phase, and Polarization in Broadband Terahertz Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic designing approach of nonlinear metasurfaces is proposed for achieving complete amplitude, phase, and polarization control of broadband terahertz generation. The design combines coupling, nonlinear PB phase, and supercell diffraction, making it free from complex nonlinear simulation. Broadband terahertz spatial&#8208;polarization separable and nonseparable beams are experimentally demonstrated. This approach holds potential in developing integrated terahertz sources with customizable functionalities.








Abstract
Terahertz (THz) generation is a crucial initial step in THz applications. However, the current THz sources face challenges in fully controlling the propagation properties of generated THz waves without the use of external devices. This limitation leads to bulky systems with unavoidable insertion losses and bandwidth constraints. To overcome these challenges and facilitate compact and versatile THz applications, a novel approach using nonlinear metasurfaces is proposed to control the amplitude, phase, and polarization of broadband THz waves directly and simultaneously at the emission stage. The basic design features an elaborated coupling&#8208;controlled chiral meta&#8208;atom, providing adjustable chirality and allowing an independent amplitude and phase control strategy under a circularly polarized (CP) pump. Furthermore, the polarization state of emitted THz wave can be arbitrarily customized by designing the superposition of the generated left&#8208;handed circularly polarized (LCP) and right&#8208;handed circularly polarized (RCP) components. This control is linearly predictable, eliminating the need for complex nonlinear simulations and interleaved supercell arrangements. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by experimentally generating two types of unique vectorial THz fields: spatial&#8208;polarization separable and nonseparable states. The proposed approach significantly enhances the capabilities of nonlinear metasurfaces, paving the way for versatile THz generation devices.

         <title>Bifacially Reinforced Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Interfaces for Minimized Recombination Loss and Enhanced Stability in Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An asymmetric &#960;&#8208;extended self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), 4&#8208;PhCz, is designed to bifacially reinforce transparent conductive electrode/SAM and SAM/perovskite interfaces. It exhibits enhanced surface coverage on indium tin oxide (ITO) and excellent energy&#8208;level alignment with 1.67&#160;eV perovskite, ultimately achieving a 31.26% power conversion efficiency in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT).








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells have shown higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than single&#8208;junction cells. However, their record PCE still falls short of the theoretical maximum, and their stability is significantly lower than that of crystalline silicon solar cells. These challenges stem from the substantial losses in open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and the instability of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, which are mainly caused by nonradiative recombination and degradation at the heterojunction interfaces, respectively. Specifically, the weak adhesion between indium tin oxide (ITO) and self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), along with inadequate interactions between the SAMs and the perovskite, contributes to this instability. Herein, a novel SAM material, 4&#8208;(11H&#8208;benzo[a]carbazol&#8208;11&#8208;yl)butyl (4&#8208;PhCz), has been developed to bifacially reinforce interfaces by enhancing SAM coverage on ITO and strengthening the interactions between SAM and perovskites. The resulting 1.67&#160;eV perovskite solar cell (PSCs) achieves a VOC of 1.273&#160;V with a low voltage loss of 0.397&#160;V relative to the bandgap and a PCE of 22.53%. The 4&#8208;PhCz&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem cell achieves a VOC of 1.96&#160;V and a PCE of 31.26%, retaining 92% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) under 1&#8208;sun illumination in a nitrogen atmosphere at 25 &#176;C.

         <title>Empowering Generalist Material Intelligence with Large Language Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review outlines how large language models drive the emergence of generalist materials intelligence by orchestrating data mining, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and autonomous experimentation. Through the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, LLMs actively unify materials ontology, simulation, synthesis, and characterization, enabling closed&#8208;loop, multimodal reasoning across the entire materials discovery cycle.








Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) are steering the development of generalist materials intelligence (GMI), a unified framework integrating conceptual reasoning, computational modeling, and experimental validation. Central to this framework is the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, where LLM&#8208;based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs&#8217; transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self&#8208;driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology&#8208;concept&#8208;computation&#8208;experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials&#8208;specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability. To address these realities, actionable strategies and a progressive roadmap for equitably and democratically implementing materials&#8208;aware LLMs in real&#8208;world practices are proposed.

         <title>Ionic Liquid&#8208;Reinforced Multifunctional Hydrogel for the Treatment of Enterocutaneous Fistula</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
ECFGel is a multifunctional hydrogel engineered to treat infection&#8208;associated ECFs. ECFGel demonstrates outstanding mechanical and biological properties, facilitating easy application, reliable occlusion, and sterilization, while promoting effective healing of infected fistula tracts. A choline and geranate&#8208;based ionic liquid hydrogel is used to concurrently enhance mechanical performance and confer antimicrobial functionality.








Abstract
Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECFs) profoundly impact patients&#8217; quality of life, contributing to high morbidity rates and increased mortality due to ineffective treatment options. To address this challenge, ECFGel, a multifunctional, tissue adhesive injectable hydrogel, designed to occlude, sterilize, and promote healing of ECF tracts, is developed. ECFGel is formulated using gelatin and oxidized dextran (O&#8208;Dex) as base components, which form chemical crosslinks within the hydrogel and with surrounding biological tissues, ensuring tissue adhesiveness. A choline and geranate&#8208;based ionic liquid (IL) is incorporated to provide dual functionality, potent antimicrobial activity, and mechanical enhancement. By optimizing IL concentration, ECFGel achieves rapid gelation, enhanced mechanical strength, and improved elastic recoverability. Additionally, iohexol (IOH) is added for radiopacity, enabling real&#8208;time imaging and further strengthening the hydrogel's mechanical properties. ECFGel demonstrates antiswelling properties, biodegradability, and effective tract occlusion in porcine soft tissues. It shows strong antimicrobial activity against highly resistant, patient&#8208;derived pathogens isolated from clinical ECF cases. In a porcine perianal fistula model, ECFGel enables rapid occlusion and complete healing, promoting tissue maturation, reducing bacterial load, and increasing markers of cell proliferation and vascularization compared to untreated controls. These promising results highlight ECFGel's potential as a new therapeutic option for treating infected ECFs.

         <title>Cleanly Removable and Degradable Bio&#8208;Based Adhesive for Flexible Displays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sustainable acrylic optically clear adhesives (OCAs) for foldable displays are developed by incorporating ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;triggered debondability and lipoic acid&#8211;based degradability through visible&#8208;light&#8208;induced bulk polymerization. These OCAs enable residue&#8208;free removal and degrade into small oligomers or recoverable monomers under mild conditions, supporting substrate recycling and adhesive recovery in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics.








Abstract
In advanced applications such as flexible displays, reusing components is essential for achieving sustainability. However, the removal of acrylic pressure&#8208;sensitive adhesives (PSAs), which bond these components, remains a major challenge due to residue formation and the non&#8208;degradable C&#9472;C backbone. Here, the development of new acrylic PSA alternatives for foldable displays is reported by introducing ultraviolet (UV)&#8208;triggered debondability, degradability through lipoic acid analogs, and a visible&#8208;light&#8208;curing process. PSAs composed of 60 mol% lipoic acid ethyl ester (LpEt)&#160;and 3 mol% UV&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable benzophenone&#8208;functionalized acrylic monomers exhibit viscoelastic properties comparable to those of conventional acrylic PSAs, while also enable clean removal from substrates after use. Following removal, the PSAs efficiently degrade into small molecular units in the presence of a green reductant or can be recovered as monomers under controlled conditions. This strategy offers a promising pathway toward sustainable PSAs, enables the recycling of valuable substrates from flexible display modules while simultaneously allows adhesive recovery, thus presents a viable alternative to conventional acrylic adhesives.

         <title>A Photonastic Prototissue Capable of Photo&#8208;Mechano&#8208;Chemical Transduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mimicking energy transduction in prototissue assemblies remains a challenge of bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. In this work, prototissues integrating protocells with photothermal gold nanoparticle proto&#8208;organelles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These prototissues exhibited light&#8208;controlled reversible contractions, programmable motions, and dynamic control of enzymatic metabolism by restricting substrate access, pioneering a route toward bioinspired materials with emergent energy transduction behaviors.








Abstract
Despite recent significant advances in the controlled assembly of protocell units into complex 3D architectures, the development of prototissues capable of mimicking the sophisticated energy transduction processes fundamental to living tissues remains a critical unmet challenge in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology. Here a synthetic approach is described to start addressing this challenge and report the bottom&#8208;up chemical construction of a photonastic prototissue endowed with photo&#8208;mechano&#8208;chemical transduction capabilities. For this, novel protocells enclosing photothermal transducing proto&#8208;organelles based on gold nanoparticles and a thermoresponsive polymeric proto&#8208;cortex are developed. These advanced protocell units are assembled into prototissues capable of light&#8208;induced reversible contractions and complex motions, which can be exploited to reversibly switch off a coordinated internalized enzyme metabolism by blocking the access of small substrate molecules. Overall, the work provides a synthetic pathway to constructing prototissues with sophisticated energy transduction mechanisms, enabling the rational design of emergent behaviors in synthetic materials and addressing critical challenges in bottom&#8208;up synthetic biology and bioinspired materials engineering.

         <title>Colorful and Semitransparent Organic Solar Modules via Air&#8208;Blade Assisted Coating of Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature air&#8208;blade coating facilitated the fabrication of large&#8208;area organic solar modules using eco&#8208;friendly solvents via controlling liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition with directional gas flow, achieving efficient opaque and colorful semitransparent modules.








Abstract
Organic solar modules (OSMs) hold potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics, yet facing challenges to fabricate uniform and large&#8208;area active layers over non&#8208;halogenated solvent coating. In this work, room&#8208;temperature air&#8208;blade assisted (RT/A) coating is presented that helps obtaining uniform active layers under ambient and non&#8208;halogenated solvent processing. It is revealed that RT/A coating mitigates the film inhomogeneity that is commonly observed during hot&#8208;substrate coating. Different to the thermal gradients&#8208;induced inhomogeneous liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of hot&#8208;substrate coating, RT/A strategy enables the control of transition time on film formation via directional gas flow to yield high&#8208;quality active layer blends at ambient coating. Large&#8208;area active layers from RT/A coating exhibit good consistency and uniformity. The resultant OSMs achieve high efficiencies with the certified PCE of 14.5% at 19.31 cm2 area (recorded in solar cell efficiency tables, version 60). By further integrating Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot transparent electrodes, colorful and semitransparent modules with PCEs of 12.80% are successfully developed. Overall, this work provides a promising method on the scalable fabrication of organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Photothermal&#8208;Responsive Aerogel&#8208;Hydrogel Binary System for Efficient Water Purification and All&#8208;Weather Hydrovoltaic Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work develops a binary aerogel&#8208;hydrogel system (SHA&#8208;HVG), achieving efficient water desalination (2.75 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and high power density (56.86 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) through enhanced interfacial evaporation and ionic concentration gradients. This study presents a cost&#8208;effective HVG strategy for water desalination and electrical energy harvesting, which is expected to promote the development of distributed energy, smart agriculture, and offshore ecosystems.








Abstract
Hydrovoltaic generators (HVGs) convert abundant water energy into distributed electricity to promote the Internet of Things. Realizing low&#8208;cost yet high&#8208;performance HVG remains challenging, hindering its commercialization and application. Inspired by the xylem conduits in plants, which transport water and nutrients, an aerogel&#8208;hydrogel binary&#8208;component system (SHA&#8208;HVG) is developed. It consists of a photothermal graphite&#8208;doped polyvinylidene fluoride (G&#8208;PVDF) aerogel, infilled with a thermosensitive wettability&#8208;switchable sulfonic acid&#8208;modified polyisopropylacrylamide hydrogel (S&#8208;PNIPAM) by in situ polymerization, which significantly promotes water/ion transporting and boosts electricity output. SHA&#8208;HVG demonstrates all&#8208;weather high output by cooperating power generation mechanisms of thermosensitive hydrogel&#8208;promoted surface photothermal evaporation during the daytime and sulfonic group&#8208;enhanced ion concentration gradient at nighttime, resulting in efficient water desalination (2.75 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and a 2669% increase in power density (56.86 &#181;W cm&#8722;2) compared to single&#8208;component HVG of G&#8208;PVDF. SHA&#8208;HVG is chemically stable and can be reactivated/recycled to improve its power generation efficiency to &#8764;130% by increasing its built&#8208;in ionic environment. A marine/offshore cultivation system is demonstrated using an SHA&#8208;HVG array, realizing an autonomous greenhouse for water desalination, self&#8208;irrigation, and self&#8208;powered environment monitoring. This work presents a cost&#8208;effective HVG strategy for efficient seawater desalination and electricity harvesting, envisioning the development of distributed energy, smart agriculture, and offshore planting.

         <title>Efficient Interfacial Electrical Energy Extraction of a Triboelectric Nanogenerator by the Charge Lock&#8208;Free Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge lock&#8208;free TENG is proposed, which has excellent electrical output performance and durability. This study provides a charge&#8208;lock&#8208;free strategy to effectively release the charge locked on the interface, which realizes efficient electrical energy extraction from sliding frictional interfaces.








Abstract
Sliding&#8208;mode triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) generate electricity by utilizing dynamic friction on the surface of dielectric materials, demonstrating notable potential for low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy harvesting. However, conventional device structures are limited by interface charge locking and low inherent capacitance, which results in a relatively low power density. Herein, the charge&#8208;locking mechanism is explored, and propose an innovative strategy for the dynamic interface shift between two materials with different polarities. When the interfaces overlap in the same materials, the locked interface charges are fully released. Based on this concept, a charge lock&#8208;free TENG (LF&#8208;TENG) is constructed. The output energy of the LF&#8208;TENG is 4.44 times that of the traditional sliding TENG. The rotating LF&#8208;TENG achieves an output charge and a current of 5 &#181;C, 100 &#181;A at 60 rpm, and an average power density of 9 W m&#8722;2 Hz&#8722;1 at 70 M&#937;. Furthermore, the equivalent circuit model is analyzed and it is found that the capacitance change of the LF&#8208;TENG is twice that of traditional devices, which is the main factor for the increase in the output power. This study provides valuable insights into efficient electrical energy extraction from sliding frictional interfaces and paves the way for the development of low&#8208;frequency mechanical energy&#8208;collection technologies.

         <title>Polarization Sensitive Vacuum&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors Based on m&#8208;Plane h&#8208;BN</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wafer&#8208;scale hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) epitaxial film exhibits pronounced anisotropy in optical absorption and carrier transport stemming from its distinct m&#8208;plane surfaces, greatly favoring its polarized vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) detection. The device demonstrates excellent polarization&#8208;sensitive performance under 188 nm linearly polarized light, along with a remarkable polarization ratio, thus extending the short&#8208;wavelength limit of existing lensless polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection technologies based on anisotropic semiconductor materials.








Abstract
Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) detection plays an essential role in space science, radiation monitoring, electronic industry, and fundamental research. Integrating polarization characteristics into VUV detection enriches the comprehension of the target attributes and broadens the signal dimensionality. Polarization detection has been widely developed in visible and infrared regions; however, it is still relatively unexplored in VUV light due to the lack of photoactive materials with low&#8208;symmetry structures, VUV selective response and radiation resistance. Here, the wafer&#8208;scale hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) epitaxial films with the distinct m&#8208;plane surfaces are demonstrated that exhibit significant anisotropy due to space symmetry breaking, instead of the routinely obtained high&#8208;symmetry c&#8208;planes governed by the most thermodynamically stable growth mode. This results in notable anisotropy in light absorption and charge density distributions, yielding a dichroic ratio greater than 10 and a carrier transport efficiency ratio (&#956;&#964;a&#8208;axis/&#956;&#964;c&#8208;axis) of 24. The h&#8208;BN based detector achieves a high polarization ratio of 6.2 for 188 nm VUV polarized light, reaching the short&#8208;wavelength limit of the reported polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. This work presents an effective strategy for designing polarized VUV photodetector from h&#8208;BN, and paves the road towards the novel integrated optoelectronics, photonics and electronics based on traditional 2D materials.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent progress of all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing PSCs in the aspects of efficiency and stability, including the basic properties and degradation mechanisms/pathways of pristine Sn and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites, as well as various strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance of devices, discuss the existing challenges in this field, and look forward to the prospects for further improvement.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic tin (Sn)&#8208;containing perovskites have emerged as highly promising photovoltaic materials for single&#8208;junction and tandem perovskite solar cells (PSCs), owing to their reduced toxicity, optimal narrow bandgap, and superior thermal stability. Since their initial exploration in 2012, significant advancements have been achieved, with the highest efficiencies of single&#8208;junction and tandem devices now surpassing 17% and 22%, respectively. Nevertheless, the intrinsic challenges associated with the oxidation susceptibility of Sn2+ and the uncontrolled crystallization dynamics impede their further development. Addressing these issues necessitates a comprehensive and systematic understanding of the degradation mechanisms inherent to all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing perovskites, as well as the development of effective mitigation strategies. This review provides a detailed overview of the research progress in all&#8208;inorganic Sn&#8208;containing PSCs, with a particular focus on the basic properties and degradation pathways of both pristine Sn and mixed Sn&#8208;Pb perovskites. Furthermore, various strategies to improve the efficiency and stability of Sn&#8208;containing PSCs are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the existing challenges and perspectives are provided for further improving the photovoltaic performance of eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

         <title>Mitigating Mobile&#8208;Ion&#8208;Induced Instabilities and Performance Losses in 2D Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenges of mobile&#8208;ion&#8208;induced instability in perovskite solar cells. Introducing bilayer passivation with ammonium salts (EDAI&#8322;/PEAI and ABS/PEAI) significantly reduces ion density and improves device stability. The approach mitigates the detrimental effects of PEAI&#8208;induced ionic losses, enhancing both performance and operational lifetime under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Bulky ammonium salt&#8208;based passivation is an effective strategy for enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is known to greatly improve open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Despite these benefits, PEAI passivation leads to substantial short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) losses and rapid degradation under operational conditions. In this work, it is revealed that the&#160;JSC loss as well as the accelerated degradation in PEAI&#8208;passivated devices is caused by an increased mobile ion density. To mitigate this performance and stability&#8208;limiting mechanism, ultrathin layers of ammonium benzenesulfonate (ABS) and/or ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) salts are then introduced between the PEAI and the perovskite, which stabilize the 2D perovskite layer and impede diffusion even under upon prolonged illumination. This leads to a reduced mobile ion density both in fresh devices and in the long term, lowering losses&#160;JSC, and thus enables power conversion efficiencies of &#8776;25% with enhanced stability. Overall, this study not only addresses the limitations of PEAI&#8208;based 2D passivation but also paves the way for understanding 2D&#8208;induced ionic&#160;JSC losses.

&lt;p&gt;This study addresses the challenges of mobile-ion-induced instability in perovskite solar cells. Introducing bilayer passivation with ammonium salts (EDAI&#8322;/PEAI and ABS/PEAI) significantly reduces ion density and improves device stability. The approach mitigates the detrimental effects of PEAI-induced ionic losses, enhancing both performance and operational lifetime under continuous illumination.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulky ammonium salt-based passivation is an effective strategy for enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is known to greatly improve open-circuit voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;) and fill factor (FF). Despite these benefits, PEAI passivation leads to substantial short-circuit current density (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;) losses and rapid degradation under operational conditions. In this work, it is revealed that the&#160;&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; loss as well as the accelerated degradation in PEAI-passivated devices is caused by an increased mobile ion density. To mitigate this performance and stability-limiting mechanism, ultrathin layers of ammonium benzenesulfonate (ABS) and/or ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) salts are then introduced between the PEAI and the perovskite, which stabilize the 2D perovskite layer and impede diffusion even under upon prolonged illumination. This leads to a reduced mobile ion density both in fresh devices and in the long term, lowering losses&#160;&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt;, and thus enables power conversion efficiencies of &#8776;25% with enhanced stability. Overall, this study not only addresses the limitations of PEAI-based 2D passivation but also paves the way for understanding 2D-induced ionic&#160;&lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; losses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Control of Chemical Doping&#8208;Mediated Space Charge for Energetic Band&#8208;Switching Modulation in Low&#8208;Noise Shortwave&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates chemical doping effects on spatial charge distributions in SWIR organic photodetectors (OPDs). Defect control through doping concentration enables energetic band modulation, reducing dark current and lowering noise&#8208;equivalent power to pico&#8208;scale levels. The findings advance low&#8208;noise SWIR OPDs, highlighting spatial defect engineering as a key strategy for improving carrier dynamics and device performance.








Abstract
This study investigates the influence of chemical doping on the spatial&#8208;charge distributions and carrier&#8208;tunneling mechanisms in single&#8208;polymer shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;organic photodetectors (OPDs). By systematically analyzing the optical and photoelectric properties influenced by chemical doping, it is identified that dopant&#8208;induced defects as space charges significantly contribute to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim (FN) tunneling, thereby impacting the performance of SWIR OPDs. At a doping concentration of 0.5&#160;mm, the formation of positively charged carriers (polarons and/or bipolarons) within the polymer matrix initiates, thereby facilitating SWIR absorption and contributing to the balance between photocurrent and noise by mitigating FN tunneling through the reduction of defect density (ND). However, as the doping concentration exceeds 5&#160;mm, the increased ND accumulates more space charge, accelerating FN tunneling. This enhances photocurrent generation and amplifies noise disproportionately, ultimately limiting OPD performance. Under ND&#8208;minimized optimum doping concentration (at 0.5&#160;mm), the OPD exhibited a noise equivalent power of 9.85 pW (at &#8722;8&#160;V, bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz, and wavelength = 1490&#160;nm), and a linear dynamic range of 42&#160;dB. These findings demonstrate the role of chemical doping in enhancing the performance of SWIR PM&#8208;OPDs, paving the way for advanced photonic sensors.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Low&#8208;Cost, and Structurally Colored Displays Using Biodegradable Hydroxypropyl Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) integrated with microfluidic devices creates scalable, eco&#8208;friendly reflective color displays. We demonstrate mechanochromic displays with 500 &#181;m pixel size and 5Hz switching rates with room for optimisation. The proposed mechanochromic HPC displays are an initial step toward more environmentally responsible color display and pixel technologies.








Abstract
Mechanochromic materials have garnered significant interest over the past decade due to their ability to change color in response to mechanical cues. While it is known that hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) self&#8208;assembles into biodegradable and low&#8208;cost mechanochromic materials, with a wide range of applications from edible colorants to optical strain sensors, mechanochromic HPC displays themselves are not reported. Here we address this challenge by combining thin mechanochromic HPC films with microfluidic arrays of inflatable microactuators that exert controlled forces. With these devices, the mechanochromic strain sensitivity, color resolution, response times, and operating frequencies of photonic aqueous HPC films are measured at decreasing length scales for the first time. Various pixel sizes, geometry, and input frequencies are also assessed to investigate mechanochromic HPC as a potential low&#8208;cost, biodegradable display. Potential applications range from dynamic color pixels for soft robotics to more environmentally responsible RGB display technology.

         <title>Biomimetic Hybrid PROTAC Nanovesicles Block Multiple DNA Repair Pathways to Overcome Temozolomide Resistance Against Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanotechnology, drug delivery, glioblastoma, PROTAC, temozolomide resistance. A biomimetic PROTAC nanovesicle (M@TP) combining temozolomide (TMZ) with GSH&#8208;activatable prodrug (PC&#8208;ss&#8208;Pro) has been developed, which can penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and target glioblastoma (GBM) through homotypic recognition, and restore sensitivity to TMZ by inducing BRD4 degradation. M@TP effectively inhibits the growth of TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM and postoperative GBM, offering a feasible strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve the prognosis of GBM.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer due to its high rates of postoperative recurrence and resistance to treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard chemotherapy for GBM. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ is significantly compromised by the activation of various intracellular DNA repair mechanisms that facilitate TMZ resistance. Herein, the upregulation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) expression is demonstrated to be a key contributor to TMZ resistance in GBM. To address this challenge, a biomimetic hybrid PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) liposome delivery system (M@TP) is developed. This system efficiently penetrates the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and specifically targets GBM cells through homotypic recognition. Once within TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM cells, the released PROTAC from M@TP can specifically degrade BRD4, effectively inhibiting multiple DNA repair pathways and restoring sensitivity to TMZ treatment. In vivo, studies showed that M@TP demonstrated significant efficacy in suppressing tumor growth in both TMZ&#8208;resistant and postoperative GBM, with prolonged mouse survival times. These findings highlight the potential of M@TP as a promising strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

         <title>3D Printing of Ultrahigh Filler Content Composites Enabled by Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for directly printing ultrahigh filler content composites is presented, whereby granular hydrogels are incorporated into rigid filler particle flow, leading to polymer&#8208;based composites with a filler content of up to 99.2&#160;wt.%. Granular hydrogels weaken the stability of arches through elastic deformation, thus mitigating clogging caused by bridging. This strategy offers a promising route for manufacturing 3D composites with exceptionally high filler content.









Abstract
Ultrahigh filler content composites have exhibited distinctive properties in various areas, such as structural materials, electrical insulation, thermal management, and energy storage devices. However, manufacturing 3D composites with ultrahigh filler content is challenging because excessive fillers have compromised the processing flowability of the composite. Here, using hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) as an example filler, a 3D printing strategy for fabricating particulate composites with ultrahigh HGM content (up to 99.2&#160;wt.%) is reported. By incorporating the highly swollen granular hydrogel as the shear sliding phase between HGMs, the probability of clogging during extrusion of the composite ink with ultrahigh HGM content is substantially reduced. A quantitative phase diagram is developed to optimally choose the ink compositions with the maximum HGM content, as well as printing parameters. The resulting composite with ultrahigh HGM content shows ceramic&#8208;foam&#8208;like brittle fracture behavior, high wave&#8208;transparent properties (0.996), and low thermal conductivity (0.045&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). Further, a thermal shield with high HGM content on a microcircuit board to validate the localized thermal protection is fabricated. It is believed that incorporating hydrogel matrix into the printing ink will unlock the capabilities of 3D printed ultrahigh filler content composites in creating more intricate structures with advanced functionalities.

         <title>Heat&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Framework for Variable&#8208;Temperature Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing framework (HDSF) is developed to repair defects at grain boundaries, improving temperature stability in PSCs. HDSF, mainly located at the grain boundaries, stabilizes the perovskite lattice and relieves crystal stress through dynamic sulfide bond exchange. This approach led to a PCE of 26.32% (certified 25.84%) with enhanced thermal stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising as the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. However, the inferior stability under various temperatures remains a significant obstacle to commercialization. Here, a heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing framework (HDSF) is implemented to repair defects at grain boundaries caused by thermal variability, enhancing PSCs' temperature stability. HDSF, distributed at the grain boundaries and surface of the perovskite film, stabilizes the perovskite lattice and releases the perovskite crystal stress through the dynamic exchange reaction of sulfide bonds. The resultant PSCs achieved a power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.32% (certified 25.84%) with elevated temperature stability, retaining 88.7% of the initial PCE after 1000 h at 85&#160;&#176;C. In a variable temperature cycling test (between &#8722;40 and 80&#160;&#176;C), the HDSF&#8208;treated device retained 87.6% of its initial PCE at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and 92.6% at 80&#160;&#176;C after 160 thermal cycles. This heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing strategy could significantly enhance the reliability of PSCs in application scenarios.

         <title>Mechanostimulatory Platform for Improved CAR T Cell Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel T&#8208;cell mechanostimulatory platform with controlled elasticity and nanotopography optimize T&#8208;cell activation by reducing T&#8208;cell exhaustion and enhancing central memory T&#8208;cell differentiation. This platform is utilized for the generation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, demonstrating improved antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo and in vivo studies.








Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet it is hindered by rapid T&#8208;cell exhaustion caused by uncontrolled activation during CAR generation. Leveraging insights into T&#8208;cell mechanosensing, a novel mechanostimulatory platform is engineered for T&#8208;cell activation based on an antigen&#8208;carrying surface with controlled elasticity and nanotopography. The platform is designed to optimize and balance T&#8208;cell exhaustion, proliferation, and CAR expression. It enhances the differentiation of T cells into the central memory subset, which is crucial for the persistence of CAR T cell therapy's anticancer effects. The platform produces CAR T cells with higher antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo experiments, and with higher in vivo persistence and ability to suppress tumor proliferation, as compared to CAR T cells generated by standard protocols. RNA&#8208;seq analysis confirmed an increased transcriptional signature of central memory T cells. Furthermore, this platform completely eliminates T&#8208;cell toxicity associated with the non&#8208;viral transfection process typically observed with standard activation methods. This platform presents a promising pathway for improving the efficiency and safety of CAR T cell therapy.

         <title>A Highly Adaptable Hydrogen Bond Re&#8208;Orientation (HyBRO) Strategy for Multiscale Vasculature Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy enables three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of vascular microchannel networks with high accuracy. By switching sacrificial material interactions with nonsolvents, HyBRO prevents swelling and deformation, enabling accurate hierarchical channels spanning a tenfold size range. The method accommodates diverse ink materials and produces vasculature exhibiting robust endothelial barrier function and ion&#8208;channel responses under shear stress.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional&#160;printing of microchannel networks mimicking native vasculature provides essential functions for biomedical applications. However, developing a highly &#8220;adaptable&#8221; technique &#8211; that can adjust to diverse materials choices, high shape accuracy, and broad size ranges &#8211; for producing physiologically responsive vasculature remains challenging. Here, an innovative hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy for microchannel network fabrication is reported. By identifying interfacial instability of sacrificial material (SM) during embedding as a core limitation, this strategy prints the SM into an optimal &#8220;nonsolvent&#8221; to shape the desirable channel structure. In this process, the nonsolvent instantaneously switches the SM from forming hydrogen bonds with exterior water to forming interior linkages inside it. This transition protects the SM from external solvent &#8220;erosion&#8221; upon re&#8208;exposure to embedding material, inhibiting deformation. Consequently, this approach enables the creation of accurate (&gt;90%), multiscale (10&#8208;fold), hierarchical microchannel networks, accommodating accurate printing of a wide range of ink materials &#8211; extending from typical hydrophilic polymers into non&#8208;typical hydrophobic ones. Further biological tests demonstrate that HyBRO&#8208;produced vasculature recapitulates not only essential endothelial barrier function but also delicate ion&#8208;channel responses to varying shear stresses, highlighting its potential for engineering physiologically responsive vasculature in broad applications.

         <title>Tailoring Cold&#8208;Resilient Electrolytes Driven by Mechanisms Underlying Ice Melting for Cryogenic Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a fresh perspective from mechanisms of chemical ice melting identifies key criteria influencing the selection of effective solutes for the development of more reliable cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes. The screened ice&#8208;melting chemical potassium formate effectively enables the realization of ultra&#8208;stable reversibility in a low&#8208;temperature environment.








Abstract
The freezing and melting behaviors of aqueous solutions are strongly influenced by the presence of chemical substances, yet the criteria for screening effective chemicals remain poorly defined. This study introduces a novel perspective to designing cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes by focusing on the mechanisms underlying ice melting and identifying the key screening criteria, providing new insights into how specific chemicals can enhance the cryogenic properties of aqueous solutions. A series of theoretical and experimental tools highlight its superior low&#8208;temperature tolerance endowed by the screened chemical solute, and the pouch full cell Zn//pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone with cathode loading up to 7.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers an impressively high capacity of 110 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This special work would enrich the design concepts and expand the paradigms of developing water&#8208;based energy storage systems in extreme environments.

         <title>Acoustic Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Twisted Heterobilayer Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a heterobilayer moir&#233; acoustic metasurface using two distinct lattice structures. The heterobilayer design contributes to divergent dispersion curves for the upper and lower layers and allows for greater flexibility in tuning their hybridization through interlayer twisting. This metasurface enables tunable magic angles and topological states, significantly broadening the potential applications of acoustic wave manipulation.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer systems enable a fundamental platform for engineering novel physical phenomena, such as topological phase transitions, polaritons, flat bands, and superconductivity. However, previous reports mainly focused on homobilayer structures, where each layer has identical configurations. In this work, a twisted heterobilayer (tHB) metasurface with strong anisotropy is presented. It is shown that hybridizing the dispersion curves of two different profiles significantly enhances the application potential of bilayer structures. It is observed that when two stacked heterogeneous metasurfaces are rotated to a specific angle, a topological phase transition occurs, which is accompanied by hyperbolic to elliptical wave propagation characteristics. At a specific &#8220;magic angle&#8221;, the dispersion curves of the two layers merge into a flat band with drastically reduced diffraction, enabling sound waves to propagate with minimal energy dissipation. Furthermore, the performance of the tHB system is robust to defects or disorders, manifested by minimal changes before and after introducing line defects into the layers. Our findings overcome the limitations of homogeneous metasurface and provide new ideas for controlling sound&#8208;material interactions.

&lt;p&gt;This research proposes a heterobilayer moir&#233; acoustic metasurface using two distinct lattice structures. The heterobilayer design contributes to divergent dispersion curves for the upper and lower layers and allows for greater flexibility in tuning their hybridization through interlayer twisting. This metasurface enables tunable magic angles and topological states, significantly broadening the potential applications of acoustic wave manipulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twisted bilayer systems enable a fundamental platform for engineering novel physical phenomena, such as topological phase transitions, polaritons, flat bands, and superconductivity. However, previous reports mainly focused on homobilayer structures, where each layer has identical configurations. In this work, a twisted heterobilayer (tHB) metasurface with strong anisotropy is presented. It is shown that hybridizing the dispersion curves of two different profiles significantly enhances the application potential of bilayer structures. It is observed that when two stacked heterogeneous metasurfaces are rotated to a specific angle, a topological phase transition occurs, which is accompanied by hyperbolic to elliptical wave propagation characteristics. At a specific &#8220;magic angle&#8221;, the dispersion curves of the two layers merge into a flat band with drastically reduced diffraction, enabling sound waves to propagate with minimal energy dissipation. Furthermore, the performance of the tHB system is robust to defects or disorders, manifested by minimal changes before and after introducing line defects into the layers. Our findings overcome the limitations of homogeneous metasurface and provide new ideas for controlling sound-material interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strain Gradient Induced Skyrmion in a van der Waals Magnet by Wrinkling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 enables field&#8208;free skyrmion generation via wrinkling&#8208;induced deformation. The opposing in&#8208;plane strain gradients across the wrinkle's peak/valley drive asymmetric domain evolution: skyrmion nucleation occurs on one flank while labyrinthine domain patterns persist on the counterpart. This asymmetry originates from strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;mediated differential modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Magnetic structures are profoundly influenced by mechanical deformation. In particular, strain has been employed to achieve the reconstruction of magnetic domains, paving a mechanical pathway to manipulate magnetic domains. However, experimentally applied strains typically exhibit non&#8208;uniform distributions. Therefore, how to distinguish the role of non&#8208;uniform strains (strain gradients) and uniform strains is crucial for understanding the mechanical manipulation of magnetic structures. Here, by directly comparing to strain tuning, it is revealed that strain gradient induced by mechanical wrinkles is critical for magnetic domain manipulation in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. A ground&#8208;state labyrinthine domain transforms into a skyrmion state in the presence of an in&#8208;plane strain gradient. Additionally, an asymmetric evolutionary behavior of the magnetic domain occurs on both sides of wrinkle peaks. Theoretical simulations uncover that though opposite in&#8208;plane strain gradient hosts C2 rotational symmetry, this asymmetric domain evolution can be achieved through the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The finding highlights the vital role of strain gradient in manipulating magnetic properties, and also offers a new mechanism for generating field&#8208;free skyrmion.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and organic chemical transformations. Different types of halide perovskite photocatalysts and their relative efficiencies for hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents and outstanding challenges are discussed.








Abstract
The need to constrain the use of fossil fuels causing global warming is motivating the development of a variety of photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel generation and chemical synthesis. In particular, semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts have been extensively exploited in solar&#8208;driven organic synthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added products, and hydrogen (H2) generation from water (H2O) splitting. Recently, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as an important class of semiconductors for heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to their interesting properties. Despite key issues with long&#8208;term stability and degradation in polar solvents due to their ionic character, there has been significant progress in halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts with improving their stability and performance in the gas and liquid phases. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for using halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysis in hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and various organic chemical transformations. The different types of halide perovskites used, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents, and the efficiencies achieved are discussed. Furthermore, the outstanding challenges associated with the use of polar electrolytes and how the stability and performance can be improved are discussed.

         <title>Dual Active Site Engineering in Porous NiW Bimetallic Alloys for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous NiW bimetallic alloy with dual active site engineering is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The alloying of Ni with W enhances H2O dissociation and *OH desorption at the W site, while also facilitating the generation of more available H* intermediates at the Ni2W1 hollow site, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution activity of the porous NiW bimetallic alloy. Notably, a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 16.59% is achieved in a NiW&#8208;incorporated solar&#8208;driven water splitting system.








Abstract
Utilizing dual active sites in electrocatalysts creates a synergistic effect, enabling the independent optimization of H2O dissociation and intermediate adsorption/desorption, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst using a dynamic H2 bubble template (DHBT) strategy is fabricated. This electrocatalyst capitalizes on the synergistic effect of dual active sites, achieving industrial&#8208;level current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#160;M KOH, with low overpotentials of 198 and 264&#160;mV, respectively. It also demonstrates excellent stability over a 200&#160;h test. Theoretical studies reveal that alloying Ni with W shifts the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of the W 5d orbital downward, which enhances *OH intermediate desorption and promotes H2O adsorption and dissociation at the W site, leading to increased active site availability. Meanwhile, this shift provides more accessible H* intermediates, further enhancing H2 production at the Ni2W1 hollow site. When the porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst is implemented in a solar&#8208;driven water splitting system, it achieves a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 16.59%. This work underscores the effectiveness of dual active site electrocatalysts for sustainable H2 production.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Molecular Structure of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of SPAN begins with the production of the S2 diradical, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of PAN, resulting in the formation of SPAN. Its molecular structure is multilayered, featuring two twisted layers (&#8776;30&#8211;40&#176;) interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds. This structure has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to 63.5 wt.% (&#8776;1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfur resources. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) effectively suppresses polysulfide dissolution and demonstrates excellent cycling stability, making it a promising candidate for cathode materials in practical Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. This study elucidates the formation mechanism, chemical bonds, and spatial structures of SPAN. The reaction begins with the generation of &#183;S2&#183; diradicals, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), ultimately resulting in the formation of C&#9472;S and N&#9472;S bonds. The multilayered structure of SPAN, characterized by C&#8208;S and N&#8208;S layers twisted at angles of &#8776;30 to 40 degrees and interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds, has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to a maximum of 63.5 wt.%, corresponding to a theoretical capacity exceeding 1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. These findings provide fundamental insights for the design of SPAN materials for advanced X&#8208;SPAN batteries.

         <title>Linear Annulation Engineering of Indolocarbazole Multiple Resonance Emitter to Overcome Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Color Purity Trilemma in Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indolocarbazole emitter employing a linear annulation strategy is developed, not only narrowing spectral bandwidth with redshifted emission through multiple resonance framework extension to afford ultrapure electroluminescence peaking at 458&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#160;nm, but also enhancing device longevity and efficiency with a long LT80 of 101&#160;h and high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3%.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) still confront the critical challenge of balancing high efficiency, operational stability, and color purity, particularly for the ones with peak wavelengths (&#955;max) &#8804; 460&#160;nm. Here, the study demonstrates deep&#8208;blue devices featuring ultrapure emission (&#955;max = 458&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum = 19&#160;nm), high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3% with small roll&#8208;off (26.9% at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2; 20.9% at 5&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and long operational LT80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of 101 hours at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, being one of the longest lifetime among OLEDs with &#955;max &#8804; 460&#160;nm and EQE &gt;20%. This breakthrough stems from an indolocarbazole narrowband emitter employing a linear annulation strategy, which not only narrows spectral bandwidth while red&#8208;shifting emission peak through multiple resonance framework extension, but also energetically and dynamically enhances device longevity via triplet energy reduction. Furthermore, strategic integration of steric hindrance on the emitting backbone suppresses intermolecular interactions and directs reactivity pathways. This emitter concurrently achieves a &#955;max of 456&#160;nm, FWHM of 15&#160;nm and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 98% in dilute toluene. The work highlights linear annulation engineering as a potential approach to resolve the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;color purity trilemma in deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Multifunctional Logic Gates via Coexistent Positive and Negative Photoconductivity of a Single Bi2Se3 Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional optoelectronic logic gate is presented based on the coexistence of PPC (Positive Photoconductivity) and NPC(Negative Photoconductivity) in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs.








Abstract
Because existing electronic logic gates have some limitations in the era of information explosion, the demand for substantial amounts of data processing has aroused interest in new types of logic gates. The use of optoelectronic materials to prepare logic gates is popular; however, they often have complex structures, high power consumption, and low reliability. Herein, a new optoelectronic logic gate (OELG) is presented based on the coexistence of positive and negative photoconductivities in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light (405 and 808 nm) through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs. For practical applications, five logic gate output signals are modulated with 100% accuracy on an 8 &#215; 8 pixel array, and simple imaging and logical processing of the images are demonstrated.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembling Composite Structural Design for the Conversion of Hydroxyl&#8208;Anchored Bonds Obtains High Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The detailed mechanisms governing the adsorption dynamics between SAMs and ITO delve into and promote homogeneous and stable SAMs film by converting the originally weak bonds anchored through physical interactions into strong bonds, helping PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 26.37%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) serve as the hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells, yet their instability on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates poses a challenge in practical. The typical SAMs are susceptible to solvents during the perovskite layer deposition process which can result in being washed or dislodged, thereby impeding the formation of a dense SAM. Here, a novel guanidine&#8208;modified polyurethane siloxane elastomers is synthesized to enhance the anchoring capability of SAMs on ITO, which exhibits strong interactions with [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) SAMs, to co&#8208;construct a self&#8208;assembled composite structure (SACS). By utilizing this anchor strategy, the weakly bonded MeO&#8208;2PACz adhering to ITO can be converted into a strongly bonded form, thereby curtailing the migration of MeO&#8208;2PACz on the ITO surface during the spin&#8208;coating process, as well as inhibiting shedding that may occur due to solvent washing during the device preparation process. SACS SAMs heighten the charge collection ability of SAMs and suppress interfacial recombination, as well as enhance the growth of the upper perovskite layer. Finally, the SACS&#8208;based SAMs device with a power conversion efficiency of 26.37%. The unencapsulated device based on SACS SAMs can be stored for at least 5000&#160;h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors Based On Band Engineering and Ferroelectric Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ga2O3&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection under low operating voltage and ultraweak light intensity conditions, enabled by effective carrier separation and transport through BaTiO3 interlayer modulation.








Abstract
Wide bandgap semiconductors have emerged as a class of deep&#8208;ultraviolet sensitive materials, showing great potentials for next&#8208;generation integrated devices. Yet, to achieve a high photoresponse of deep&#8208;ultraviolet detector without complicated designs at low supply voltage and weak light intensity is challenging. Herein, a new way is designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive vertical&#8208;structured photodetector with epitaxial 7&#160;nm BaTiO3 interlayer and 10&#160;nm Ga2O3 photosensitive layer, realizing the detection to a rare weak deep UV light intensity (0.1&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at a voltage under 4.8&#160;V and demonstrating a surge in responsivity up to 1.1&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 with ultrafast response of 0.24 &#181;s/33.4 &#181;s (rise/decay). A responsivity of 3.8&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 at 0&#160;V also has been reached. The dark current is suppressed by enlarged conduction band offset and meanwhile the photocurrent is enhanced by unidirectional conducting valance band offset, which formed by BaTiO3 interlayer. BaTiO3 also contributes most to the photoresponse at 0&#160;V through its ferroelectric depolarization electric field.

&lt;p&gt;Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based deep-ultraviolet photodetectors achieve high-sensitivity detection under low operating voltage and ultraweak light intensity conditions, enabled by effective carrier separation and transport through BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer modulation.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wide bandgap semiconductors have emerged as a class of deep-ultraviolet sensitive materials, showing great potentials for next-generation integrated devices. Yet, to achieve a high photoresponse of deep-ultraviolet detector without complicated designs at low supply voltage and weak light intensity is challenging. Herein, a new way is designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive vertical-structured photodetector with epitaxial 7&#160;nm BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer and 10&#160;nm Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; photosensitive layer, realizing the detection to a rare weak deep UV light intensity (0.1&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) at a voltage under 4.8&#160;V and demonstrating a surge in responsivity up to 1.1&#160;A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with ultrafast response of 0.24 &#181;s/33.4 &#181;s (rise/decay). A responsivity of 3.8&#160;mA&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&#160;V also has been reached. The dark current is suppressed by enlarged conduction band offset and meanwhile the photocurrent is enhanced by unidirectional conducting valance band offset, which formed by BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer. BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also contributes most to the photoresponse at 0&#160;V through its ferroelectric depolarization electric field. These results provide a path toward high-sensitive, low-power-consumption, and highly-integrated deep-ultraviolet detection, beyond conventional ones.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Icing on the Cake: Integrating Optical Fiber with Second Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen for Exceptional Phototheranostics of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, a versatile NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen is constructed. Experimental and theoretical studies both demonstrate that the AIE luminogen is unambiguously advantageous to implement optical fiber&#8208;mediated treatment of bladder cancer under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging.








Abstract
Bladder cancer is a common urological malignancy characterized by high morbidity, high recurrence rate and high mortality, imposing heavy burdens on patients mentally and financially. The research pioneers a diagnostic and therapeutic approach that integrates a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) multimodal phototheranostic platform with optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy strategy, to implement a comprehensive diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; treatment of bladder cancer. The proposed molecule, namely BTO&#8208;TTQ, is elaborately designed through electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering and demonstrates satisfying NIR&#8208;II emission with aggregation&#8208;induced emission features, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and prominent generation of type I reactive oxygen species. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to deeply elucidate the energy dissipation pathways of the excited state and the impact of intramolecular motion on their photophysical properties. Furthermore, under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging, hyaluronic acid&#8208;modified BTO&#8208;TTQ nanoparticles exhibit exceptional performance in optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy for air&#8208;pouch bladder cancer models. This study thus brings a new insight into the development of superior versatile phototheranostics for clinical theranostics of bladder cancer.

         <dc:description>
An intriguing orderly&#8208;oxidization strategy is proposed to construct semi&#8208;metallic catalytic units in the topology&#8208;sensitive half&#8208;antiperovskites, in which the spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state of active sites can simultaneously improve spin&#8208;dependent acidic OER reactivity and stability. These findings provide new inspirations for steering the spin&#8208;related acidic OER pathway and further promoting the application of topological materials in energy/environmental science.








Abstract
Developing inexpensive catalysts for acidic water oxidation plays a critical role in energy conversions and storages, but which have to trade off their catalytic activity and electrochemical stability. Different from traditional nano&#8208;engineering, herein we focus onto manipulating the spin&#8208;dependent topological quantum interactions to facilitate acidic water splitting at half&#8208;antiperovskite (Ni2Co1In2S2) with orderly&#8208;oxidized Kagome lattices, in which spatial wave functions of the triangular metal units (M3) are spontaneously converted to the anti&#8208;symmetry feature due to the symmetry breaking from controllable bridged&#8208;oxygen decorations (M3O), leading to a spin&#8208;selecting&#8208;dependent electronic reconfiguration. This topology&#8208;sensitive symmetry breaking makes the super&#8208;exchange interactions among neighboring metal sites switch to the indirect out&#8208;plane configuration (M&#9472;O&#9472;M) from the direct in&#8208;plane form (M&#9472;M), meanwhile the spin&#8208;dependent transformation from antiferromagnetic states to ferromagnetic states causes these metal sites to demonstrate a semi&#8208;metallic property for optimizing their bonding interactions with reactants. As a result, the capacity of carrier migration and intermediate diffusion in the inner Helmholtz region is significantly improved, which makes mass activity increase to 20.5 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of &#8776;356&#160;mV, demonstrating an obvious superiority over the other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts without noble metals. This work provides a new insight for designing topology&#8208;dependent catalysts to better understand spin&#8208;related reaction kinetics.

         <title>Engineered Nanozymes with Asymmetric Mn&#9472;O&#9472;Ce Sites for Intratumorally Leveraged Multimode Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable dual&#8208;atom nanozymes with highly asymmetric O&#8208;bridged Ce&#8208;Mn diatomic catalytic centers embedded in the oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered bimetallic silicate nanospheres is massively produced by a facile hydrothermal method. After loading epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG) and modifying with hyaluronic acid, the innovated nanoplatform is used for achieving O2 self&#8208;sufficient photodynamic therapy, tumor glutathione&#8208;depletion/EGCG&#8208;field&#8208;effect enhanced chemdynamic therapy, as well as mild photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Due to the enhanced flexibility of catalytic sites and synergistic effects between dual&#8208;atom active centers, dual&#8208;atom nanozymes stand out in the tumor catalytic therapy. However, precisely regulating the d&#8208;band centers of diatomic sites to break the linear&#8208;scaling relationship between intermediates remains a challenge. Herein, the hydrothermally mass&#8208;produced oxygen vacancies&#8208;engineered bimetallic silicate bio&#8208;nanoplatform with highly asymmetric O&#8208;bridged cerium&#9472;manganese (Ce&#9472;Mn) diatomic catalytic centers (CeMn&#8208;V DAs/EGCG@HA) is meticulously constructed by loading epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG) and modifying with hyaluronic acid (HA) for multimodal synergistic cancer therapy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ce sites serves as secondary catalytic centers and upshifts d&#8208;band center of the Mn sites, thereby optimizing the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. The asymmetric Mn&#9472;O&#9472;Ce moiety facilitates electron transport within CeMn&#8208;V DAs, significantly enhancing peroxidase&#8208;like activities (Km = 27.7&#160;mM and Vmax = 3.21&#215;10&#9472;7&#160;M s&#9472;1). Upon 650&#160;nm laser irradiation, CeMn&#8208;V DAs/EGCG inhibits heat shock protein expression, enabling mild&#8208;photothermal (&#951; = 36.1%) therapy, which can productively inhibit tumor growth in vivo, with an inhibition rate of up to 96.2%. Due to the ligand&#8208;field effect of EGCG&#8208;Mn/Ce complexes, high&#8208;valent metal ions are effectively reduced, sustaining an intrinsic self&#8208;driven cocatalytic cycle reaction. Overall, the construction of highly asymmetric bridged diatomic nanozymes will further promote the deep integration of nanotechnology and biology.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cation Disorder Enhances Comprehensive Performance in Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tailored annealing strategy to disrupt long&#8208;range cation ordering in Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (MRLOs), enhancing their electrochemical performance for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Through multiscale structural analyses, including neutron techniques and maximum entropy simulations, improved Na+ diffusion, reduced distortions, and long&#8208;cycle stability, highlighting MRLO as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance cathode material for energy storage applications, are revealed.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (MRLOs) are promising low&#8208;cost cathode materials for sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the low Mn4+/Mn3+ redox potential limits their energy densities, and the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion that occurs surrounding Mn3+ at low voltages destabilizes the structure. Additionally, complex ordered structures inherently present in MRLOs hinder Na+ migration. In this study, new types of cation ordering structures are discovered in common MRLOs. By regulating oxygen vacancy formation, the transition from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range cation ordering is disrupted, effectively mitigating cooperative Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and achieving a 95.3% capacity retention over 1&#160;000 cycles at 8&#160;C. The maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis is performed based on neutron diffraction data, which visualizes significantly optimized Na+ diffusion pathways in long&#8208;range disordered cathode with enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the formation of oxygen vacancy elevates the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox potential, resulting in a competitive energy density of 626&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 within 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V in a half&#8208;cell configuration. This work offers a multiscale approach to precise elucidation of the cathode crystal structure and provides a feasible pathway to optimize sodium&#8208;ion cathodes by disrupting long&#8208;range cation ordering, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance.

&lt;p&gt;This study introduces a tailored annealing strategy to disrupt long-range cation ordering in Mn-rich layered oxides (MRLOs), enhancing their electrochemical performance for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Through multiscale structural analyses, including neutron techniques and maximum entropy simulations, improved Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, reduced distortions, and long-cycle stability, highlighting MRLO as a sustainable, high-performance cathode material for energy storage applications, are revealed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mn-rich layered oxides (MRLOs) are promising low-cost cathode materials for sustainable sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). However, the low Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; redox potential limits their energy densities, and the Jahn-Teller distortion that occurs surrounding Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; at low voltages destabilizes the structure. Additionally, complex ordered structures inherently present in MRLOs hinder Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; migration. In this study, new types of cation ordering structures are discovered in common MRLOs. By regulating oxygen vacancy formation, the transition from short-range to long-range cation ordering is disrupted, effectively mitigating cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion and achieving a 95.3% capacity retention over 1&#160;000 cycles at 8&#160;C. The maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis is performed based on neutron diffraction data, which visualizes significantly optimized Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion pathways in long-range disordered cathode with enhanced Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the formation of oxygen vacancy elevates the Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;/Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; redox potential, resulting in a competitive energy density of 626&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; within 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V in a half-cell configuration. This work offers a multiscale approach to precise elucidation of the cathode crystal structure and provides a feasible pathway to optimize sodium-ion cathodes by disrupting long-range cation ordering, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Assembly Hydration&#8208;Cycle Crystals for Multidimensional Off&#8208;Grid Water&#8208;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable hydrophilic coordination scaffolds (RHCS) for sustainable water&#8208;energy systems are presented. The Ca2+&#8208;SO42&#8722; bilayer, stabilized by dynamic hydrogen bonds, enables: 1) 44% lower evaporation enthalpy via asymmetric hydration, 2) ambient self&#8208;assembly of superhydrophilic substrates, and 3) temperature&#8208;responsive regeneration. RHCS reduces energy use by 1&#8211;2 orders versus conventional systems, which offer a closed&#8208;loop solution to global water&#8208;energy challenges.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) technology shows water&#8208;energy solution potential but faces industrialization barriers from substrate scalability limits. Here, a regenerative hydrated coordination scaffold (R&#8208;HCS) is presented that redefines material design by leveraging water molecules as dynamic structural directors throughout the material lifecycle. Unlike conventional hydrogel/aerogel systems requiring energy&#8208;intensive crosslinking (&#8722;&#916;E = 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude) or freeze&#8208;drying processes, R&#8208;HCS forms spontaneously through water&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of calcium sulfate under ambient conditions. Hydration shells drive hierarchical crystallization while fundamentally restructuring hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, achieving a 44% reduction in water evaporation enthalpy. The framework demonstrates unique thermal reconfiguration, exhibiting reversible dissociation&#8208;reassembly behavior (&gt;100 &#176;C threshold) that enables full material regeneration (performance decay &lt; 5%) using solar thermal energy/waste heat without chemical additives. Crucially, RHCS maintains exceptional ligand stability even when utilizing natural seawater. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an R&#8208;HCS integrated passive evaporation module achieves 77.2% water recovery under 1 sun irradiation, coupled with 30 &#176;C thermal assembly temperature reduction at 1.5 sun intensity. Concurrently, crystallizer units maintain stable 2.31&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 evaporation rates in 3.5 wt% brine. This water&#8208;centric design paradigm establishes a new class of adaptive materials where solvent&#8211;solute interactions become the driving force for circular water&#8208;energy systems, potentially redefining sustainable infrastructure for off&#8208;grid regions.

         <title>Suppression of Tin Oxidation via Sn&#8594;B Bonding Interactions for High&#8208;Resolution Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Neuromorphic Imaging Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boric acid&#8208;added 2D layered tin&#8208;based perovskite ((4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4) films utilize new Sn&#8594;B donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to suppress Sn2+ oxidation, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination, low trap density, and high uniformity. This enables a vertical optoelectronic synapse with excellent synaptic performance. Finally, a high&#8208;resolution neuromorphic imaging array for image recognition, memory, and processing surpasses traditional image sensors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based perovskites, specifically (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4, possess significant potential for the development of high&#8208;performance, robust neuromorphic imaging sensors, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and compatibility with conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication techniques and silicon&#8208;based readout circuits. However, the excessive oxidation of Sn2+ remains a significant obstacle, leading to suboptimal synaptic performance and low resolution in the neuromorphic imaging sensors due to increased recombination losses and poor film uniformity. This study first demonstrates that the introduction of novel Sn&#8594;B donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions effectively suppresses Sn2+ oxidation, enhancing uniformity, reducing nonradiative recombination, and improving synaptic plasticity. A vertical optoelectronic synapse demonstrates diverse synaptic behaviors, attributed to hole trapping and detrapping at the device interface. Additionally, the device enables applications in associative learning, neuromorphic computation, letter encoding, and handwritten digit recognition. Ultimately, integration with silicon circuits results in a high&#8208;resolution (32 &#215; 32) neuromorphic imaging array, one of the highest reported resolutions for perovskite optoelectronic synapse arrays. The improved uniformity of boric acid&#8208;added (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4 perovskite films significantly reduces photo response non&#8208;uniformity, enhances resolution, and improves memory capabilities. This neuromorphic imaging array successfully integrates sensing, storage, and computation, enabling advanced functionalities like letter recognition, memory, and processing, surpassing conventional image sensors.

         <title>Modularized Cathode with Neural Network Topology for High Rate and Fault&#8208;Tolerant Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

In this study, a modular electrode system is designed by employing nanozyme&#8208;embedded microreactor units as independent reaction modules and establishing a fully connected cascaded neural network topology to enable efficient inter&#8208;module interconnection and synergistic optimization.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox kinetics of electrodes, achieving synergistic optimization of local energy conversion and overall charge transfer, and overcoming the technical bottleneck of significant performance degradation due to local unit failure in traditional electrode systems are crucial for developing high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Here, a modular cathode system (CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN) with a fully connected cascade neural network topology (FNN) is designed by constructing microreactor modules (CoB1N3&#8208;MRs) with embedded nanozymes (Co&#8208;B1N3), ordering and efficiently interconnecting them. This system not only enables efficient energy conversion within individual microreactors but also significantly enhances the long&#8208;range charge transport efficiency and energy aggregation capacity of the electrodes. Furthermore, CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN achieves fault tolerance to local damage through its distributed energy storage units and redundant charge transport channels. This synergistically enhanced modular electrode system for energy conversion and charge transport exhibits high specific discharge capacity (0.2 C, 1211 mAh g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (5 C, 731.26 mAh g&#8722;1; 10 C, 471.05 mAh g&#8722;1), and shows outstanding electrochemical performances in high sulfur loading, low electrolytes, and flexible pouch batteries (0.2 C, 1165 mAh g&#8722;1), fully demonstrating its practical application value.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2502894, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers reveal a novel self&#8208;catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#8208;Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K5Te3 and K2Te) and achieves an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning
A metallic surface micropatterned with a laser achieves self&#8208;cooling capacity when it faces the night sky thanks to its enhanced infrared emissivity, which triggers water condensation similar to natural dew on leaves. The patterned microgrooves promote condensation as a continuous film rather than dispersed droplets, enabling an efficient and autonomous harvesting of dew water. More details ban be found in article number 2419472 by Pablo Pou&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post&#8208;diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization.

     alt="Field-Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type-II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full-scale field-free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type-II Dirac semimetal, Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn (111) surface with a &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next-generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT-driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field-free switching through out-of-plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-polarized spins with high charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large-scale production. This study demonstrates field-free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type-II Dirac semimetal Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; symmetry, leading to significant &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-polarized spin accumulation in the Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low-power, high-density spintronic memory and logic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near&#8208;Infrared III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti&#8208;oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50&#160;h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti&#8208;oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single&#8208;halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectric CuCrP2S6&#8208;Enabled Hysteresis&#8208;Free Negative Capacitance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC&#8208;FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC&#8208;FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor&#8208;loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis&#8208;free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis&#8208;free NC&#8208;FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness&#8208;independent dielectric constant of &#8776;35. Subsequently, NC&#8208;FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra&#8208;steep SS (&#8776;12&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor&#8208;loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2&#160;V and hysteresis&#8208;free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Creating Vacancy Strong Interaction to Enable Homogeneous High&#8208;Throughput Ion Transport for Efficient Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport (ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge&#8208;specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&#8722;1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large&#8208;scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&#8722; anions, while the electron&#8208;rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism.

&lt;p&gt;Creating sulfur-vacancy-rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high-throughput Li-ion transport (ultra-high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra-long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge-specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid-state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large-scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high-throughput Li-ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)-based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high-throughput Li-ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, while the electron-rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra-long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high-throughput Li-ions transport mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much&#8208;improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as cosalts, where the Zn-Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much-improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Ir/Mn Co&#8208;Mixing and Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide&#8208;path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240&#160;mV to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with the Ir mass&#8208;activity &gt;&#160;75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water&#8208;electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Molecular Stitching in Polysaccharide Precursor for Fabricating Hard Carbon with Ultra&#8208;High Plateau Capacity of Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens the avenue to molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant&#160;closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3 nm), thereby&#160;enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low&#8208;voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost&#8208;effective hard carbon (STHC&#8208;MS). A mild air&#8208;heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched&#8208;chain starch, the cross&#8208;linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3&#160;nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC&#8208;MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g&#8722;1 with a remarkable low&#8208;voltage (below 0.1&#160;V) capacity of 294 mAh g&#8722;1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC&#8208;MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. STHC&#8208;MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon&#8208;based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure-sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long-term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning-assisted system using &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home-based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Emergent Multiple Spin States From Baromagnetic Effect in Strongly Correlated Magnet Mn&#8323;GaC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin&#8208;orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high&#8208;density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi&#8208;logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p&#8208;T&#8208;H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi&#8208;logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high&#8208;density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu&#8208;based chalcogenides, the &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to Bi2Te3&#8208;based materials. The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (0&#160;&amp;lt;&#160;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow-bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;-phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; for Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu-based chalcogenides, the &#947;-phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials. The developed Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1+&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T&#8208;TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T&#8208;TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex (0 &#10877; x &#10877; 2) is systematically investigated using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent&#160;physics.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu&#8208;based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction&#8208;acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single&#8208;carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu&#8208;based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh&#8208;performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

     alt="Orbital Matching Mechanism-Guided Synthesis of Cu-Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple yet intuitive &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu-based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono-carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu-based single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu-based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu-based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction-acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single-carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu-based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh-performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine&#8208;tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio&#8208;inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>In Situ Repair and Reconstruction of Copper Surface Enhanced Its Anti&#8208;Oxidation Properties and Stability for Deep Learning&#8208;Powered Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>

In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu&#8208;SC in 0.1&#160;m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mm yr&#8722;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mm yr&#8722;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu&#8208;SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation properties of Cu&#8208;SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning&#8208;based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

         <title>Suspension Electrolytes with Catalytically Self&#8208;Expediating Desolvation Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#8208;x&#8208;suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0&#160;&#176;C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron&#8208;delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron&#8208;density&#8208;adjustable CeO2&#8208;x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect&#8208;rich CeO2&#8208;x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2&#8208;x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0&#160;&#176;C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity&#8208;retention of 96.75% at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large&#8208;areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Early Colorectal Cancerization via Amplified Sensing of MicroRNA&#8208;21 in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900 nm) window for non&#8208;invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA&#8208;21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low&#8208;abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early&#8208;stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength subregion (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm) by integrating DNAzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide&#8208;dye hybrid system. In the early&#8208;stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA&#8208;21 initiates the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non&#8208;invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long&#8208;term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Density Grain Boundaries in Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox Solid&#8208;Solution Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable OER Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru&#8208;Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at industrial&#8208;scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high&#8208;density grain boundaries within solid&#8208;solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial&#8208;scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&#8722;1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

Most notably, the Ru&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;0.2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits outstanding industrial-scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 V and maintaining stability for &amp;gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An n&#8208;Doped Organic Cross&#8208;Linked Electron Transport Layer with High Electrical Conductivity for High&#8208;Efficiency Tandem Organic Photovoltaics</title>

An n&#8208;doped ETL, that is c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI with high electrical conductivity, strong work function modification ability and good solvent resistance, is developed via a simple in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction. The tandem OPVs, with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL (m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS/c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI) achieve 20.06% efficiency under solar radiation, and 38.50% efficiency under 808 nm laser. This study provides a new method to design high&#8208;perfoimance ICLs.








Abstract
With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self&#8208;doping, c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross&#8208;linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent&#8208;resistance. The above features enable c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single&#8208;junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single&#8208;junction device with c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO&#8208;based device (17.09%). The homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tandem devices with m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS:c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808&#160;nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, the homo&#8208;tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Grains &gt; 2&#160;&#181;m with Regulating Grain Boundaries for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide&#8208;bandgap (1.78&#160;eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2&#160;&#181;m, enabling the realization of efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (&gt;40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation&#8208;tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2&#160;&#181;m and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices, with a two&#8208;terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four&#8208;terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

&lt;p&gt;N-doped CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites, incorporating 3D low-tortuosity tunneling structure, self-catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong-lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra-low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion-diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (K&lt;i&gt;

Consequently, the optimized N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te-based anodes.

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions.

Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

         <title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real&#8208;time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high&#8208;brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X&#8208;ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon&#8208;flux density&#8208;, dose&#8208;, and time&#8208;dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X&#8208;ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.
